      "The video opens with a man in the driver's seat of a truck wearing sunglasses and talking to the camera. The scene cuts to a red Ford Raptor truck with \"Black Magic\" and \"419\" logos, with a man sitting on the bed. There are shots of the red Raptor driving on a winding road, followed by the man in the truck again. The screen then cuts to shots of various cars driving in a rally, including a Ferrari, a blue Mitsubishi Lancer, and a red Shelby GT500. There are also shots of a police officer and cars being pulled over. The video then returns to the man in the truck, where he is showing off the radar detectors he is using for the rally. The video ends with a shot of the man driving.\n",

      "Last year, the smoking tire went on the Bullrun Live Rally in the 2010 Ford SVT Raptor. I liked it so much, I bought one, and here it is. We're going back to Bullrun this year of course with help from our friends at Black Magic. We're so serious about it, we got two Valentine One radar detectors. Oh yeah. So we're all set up and the reason we got two is because we're going to be going a little bit faster. We got a 2011 Shelby GT500 with a 550 horsepower all-aluminum V8. We're going to be right in the action bringing you guys a video everyday live from the Bullrun Rally, July 9th to 16th. And the only place to watch it is on BlackMagicShine.com or right here on the smoking tire.\n"
