# RibbitXDB Release Notes

## Version 1.1.4 (December 2025) - SQLite Compatibility Update

**Theme**: Developer Experience & Standard SQL Compliance

### 🌟 Top Highlights

*   **100% SQLite Compatibility**: Added `IF NOT EXISTS`, `DEFAULT` values, `AUTOINCREMENT`, and `CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS`. You can now use standard SQLite schemas directly.
*   **Async API**: New `connect_async()` function allowing non-blocking database operations with `async`/`await` syntax.
*   **Migrations System**: Integrated `MigrationManager` for versioning your database schema with `up()` and `down()` methods.
*   **Schema Introspection**: New `DESCRIBE table` and `SHOW TABLES` commands powered by system tables (`__ribbit_tables`, etc.).
*   **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Errors now include context, line numbers, and helpful hints.

### 🚀 New Features

#### SQL Engine
*   **Transaction Control**: Nested transactions with `SAVEPOINT` and `RELEASE`.
*   **Pragmas**: `PRAGMA table_exists(...)`, `PRAGMA table_info(...)`.
*   **DDL Enhancements**: 
    *   `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ...`
    *   `DROP TABLE IF EXISTS ...`
    *   `CREATE INDEX [IF NOT EXISTS] ...`
    *   `DROP INDEX [IF EXISTS] ...`

#### Developer Experience
*   **CLI Admin**: Enhanced shell with auto-completion and syntax highlighting (in CLI package).
*   **Python API**: Added `connection.table_exists(name)` helper.
*   **Exceptions**: Granular exception hierarchy (`TableNotFoundError`, `ConstraintViolationError`).

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
*   Fixed issue where `UPDATE` without `WHERE` clause would fail silently.
*   Fixed parsing of nested parentheses in complex `WHERE` clauses.
