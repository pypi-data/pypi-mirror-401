"""arequest - High-performance async HTTP client with a requests-like API.

Designed for low overhead and a familiar developer experience.

Example:
    import asyncio
    import arequest
    
    async def main():
        # Simple one-off request
        response = await arequest.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
        print(response.json())
        
        # Using session for connection reuse (recommended)
        async with arequest.Session() as session:
            resp = await session.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
            print(resp.status_code)
            
            # Concurrent requests
            import asyncio
            tasks = [session.get(f'https://httpbin.org/get?i={i}') for i in range(10)]
            responses = await asyncio.gather(*tasks)
    
    asyncio.run(main())
