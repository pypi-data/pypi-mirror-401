qlty is a Python library designed to handle large 2D or 3D tensors efficiently by splitting them into smaller, manageable chunks. This library is particularly useful for processing large datasets that do not fit into memory, enabling chunked processing for machine learning workflows.

Features
--------

* Efficient tensor splitting and stitching
* Intelligent border handling to minimize artifacts
* Support for both in-memory and disk-cached processing
* 2D and 3D tensor support
* **2.5D Quilt** - Convert 3D volumetric data to multi-channel 2D by slicing Z dimension
* **Backend System** - Unified interface for multiple data sources (torch.Tensor, Zarr, HDF5, memory-mapped)
* **Image Stack Utilities** - Convert image file stacks to efficient Zarr format
* **OME-Zarr Support** - Convert image stacks to OME-Zarr format with multiscale pyramids (Gaussian and Laplacian)
* **Laplacian Pyramids** - Store difference maps for perfect reconstruction from base level plus residuals
* **False Color Visualization** - UMAP-based false-color visualization of 2D images
* Sparse data handling utilities
* Patch pair extraction helpers for partially overlapping regions in 2D and 3D
* Pre-tokenization utilities (``pretokenizer_2d``) for preparing patches for sequence models
* Numba acceleration for 2D stitching and batch token processing with parallel execution

Quick Start
-----------

Installation::

    pip install qlty torch zarr numpy einops dask numba

Basic Usage::

    import torch
    from qlty import NCYXQuilt

    # Create a quilt object
    quilt = NCYXQuilt(
        Y=128, X=128,
        window=(32, 32),
        step=(16, 16),
        border=(5, 5),
        border_weight=0.1
    )

    # Split data into patches
    data = torch.randn(10, 3, 128, 128)
    patches = quilt.unstitch(data)

    # Process patches (e.g., with a neural network)
    processed = your_model(patches)

    # Stitch back together
    reconstructed, weights = quilt.stitch(processed)
