"""Tests for numba availability and usage.

Note: Numba is imported at the top level in qlty2D.py, so we cannot easily
mock it being unavailable without significant refactoring. However, we can
test that both use_numba=True and use_numba=False paths work correctly.

The numba_njit_stitch function (lines 20-34) is JIT-compiled and cannot be
directly tested, but it is exercised through the use_numba=True path.
