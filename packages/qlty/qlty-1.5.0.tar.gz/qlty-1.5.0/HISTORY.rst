1.3.5 (2025-11-23)
------------------

* **Bug Fix** - Fixed ``ZarrBackend`` dimension normalization when accessing slices vs integers:
  * Fixed distinction between ``n`` being an integer vs slice/None for proper dimension handling
  * When ``n`` is an integer, returns (C, Z, Y, X) - no N dimension
  * When ``n`` is None or slice, returns (N, C, Z, Y, X) - full 5D
  * Resolves ``ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 4, got 3)`` in 2.5D Quilt conversion

1.3.4 (2025-11-23)
------------------

* **Bug Fix** - Fixed ``ZarrBackend`` to properly handle 3D zarr arrays (Z, Y, X) from ``stack_to_zarr()``:
  * Fixed dimension handling when loading slices from 3D zarr arrays
  * Correctly adds N and C dimensions based on whether n is specified
  * Resolves ``ValueError: not enough values to unpack`` when using 2.5D Quilt with ``stack_to_zarr()`` output
  * Added example code in ``tutorial/stack_to_zarr_usage_example.py`` demonstrating workflow

1.3.3 (2025-11-23)
------------------

* **Progress Reporting** - Added comprehensive progress feedback to ``stack_files_to_zarr()``:
  * Progress bars using ``tqdm`` (if available) or periodic status messages
  * Shows overall progress for multiple stacks
  * Displays progress during image loading and zarr writing operations
  * Status messages showing stack information, worker count, and completion status
  * Helps monitor long-running operations on large image stacks

1.3.2 (2025-11-23)
------------------

* **Performance Optimization** - Enhanced multiprocessing in ``stack_files_to_zarr()``:
  * Implemented parallel load-and-write for large stacks (>10 images)
  * Workers now load images and write directly to zarr in parallel (not sequentially)
  * Dramatically reduces memory usage by avoiding loading all images into memory at once
  * Enables concurrent zarr writes using all available CPU cores
  * Optimized for very large stacks (e.g., 800+ images on 127-core systems)
  * Uses ``imap_unordered`` for better performance with many tasks

1.3.1 (2025-11-23)
------------------

* **Performance Improvement** - Added multiprocessing support to ``stack_files_to_zarr()``:
  * New ``num_workers`` parameter for parallel image loading
  * Auto-detects CPU count when ``num_workers=None`` (default)
  * Significantly improves performance for large image stacks by loading images in parallel
  * Maintains sequential zarr writing to preserve order

1.3.0 (2025-11-23)
------------------

* **Test Coverage Improvements** - Improved overall test coverage from 89% to 91%:
  * Fixed ``stack_to_zarr.py`` coverage from 38% to 94% by adding ``tifffile`` to test dependencies
  * Improved ``base.py`` coverage from 82% to 99%
  * Improved ``qlty2DLarge.py`` coverage to 100% (removed test function from production code)
  * Added comprehensive tests for ``qlty2DLarge`` and ``qlty3DLarge`` modules
  * Fixed CI coverage reporting to use ``coverage run`` directly for better accuracy
* **Code Quality** - Removed test/example functions from production modules
* **CI/CD** - Enhanced dependency verification and coverage reporting in CI workflows

1.2.3 (2025-11-23)
------------------

* **New: 2.5D Quilt Module** - Added ``NCZYX25DQuilt`` class for converting 3D volumetric data
  (N, C, Z, Y, X) into 2.5D multi-channel data by slicing the Z dimension into channels.
  Supports flexible channel specifications (identity, mean, std operations), selective z-slice
  processing, and two accumulation modes (2D planes or 3D stack).
* **New: Backend System** - Added comprehensive backend support for various data sources:
  * ``InMemoryBackend``: Wraps torch.Tensor for in-memory data
  * ``ZarrBackend``: On-demand loading from OME-Zarr files
  * ``HDF5Backend``: On-demand loading from HDF5 datasets
  * ``MemoryMappedBackend``: Memory-mapped numpy arrays
  * ``TensorLike3D``: Unified tensor-like interface for all backends
  * Convenience functions: ``from_zarr()``, ``from_hdf5()``, ``from_memmap()``
* **New: Image Stack to Zarr Utility** - Added ``stack_files_to_zarr()`` function in
  ``qlty.utils.stack_to_zarr`` for converting image file stacks (TIFF, PNG, etc.) into
  efficient Zarr format with automatic pattern matching, gap detection, and metadata storage.
* **New: False Color Visualization** - Added ``FalseColorGenerator`` class in ``qlty.utils.false_color_2D``
  for creating UMAP-based false-color visualizations of 2D images using patch-based dimensionality
  reduction.
* **Improved Test Coverage** - Added 65+ new tests across qlty2_5D, backends_2_5D, and stack_to_zarr
  modules, significantly improving coverage:
  * ``qlty2_5D.py``: 75% → 88% coverage
  * ``backends_2_5D.py``: 62% → 70% coverage
  * ``stack_to_zarr.py``: 38% → 94% coverage
* **CI Improvements** - Fixed coverage reporting in CI by using ``coverage run`` directly instead
  of pytest-cov to avoid torch import conflicts. Added coverage verification steps.

1.2.0 (2025-11-13)
------------------

* Added optional rotation-aware extraction for 2D patch pairs with matching overlap handling.
* Expanded tests and documentation to cover rotated patch workflows.

1.1.0 (2025-11-12)
------------------

* Restored Numba acceleration for 2D quilting via color-based parallel stitching that avoids write races.
* Expanded 3D patch-pair sampling tests to cover edge cases and fallback logic, driving coverage to 100%.
* Updated documentation to describe partially overlapping patch-pair utilities.
* Noted that NCZYXQuilt and the Large* variants still need analogous race-free acceleration.
