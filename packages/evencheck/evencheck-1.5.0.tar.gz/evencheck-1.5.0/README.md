# evencheck

The most inefficient way to check if a number is even.

## Installation

```bash
pip install evencheck
```

## Usage

```python
from evencheck import iseven

number_true = iseven(2) # True
print(number_true)
number_false = iseven(7) # False
print(number_false)
```

## Hot it Works

- Downloads a huge JSON file
- Reads it line by line
- Stops when the number is found
- Deletes the file

Absolutely useless. By design.
