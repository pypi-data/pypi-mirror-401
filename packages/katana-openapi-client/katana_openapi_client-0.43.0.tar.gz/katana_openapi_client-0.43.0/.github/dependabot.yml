# Dependabot configuration for automated dependency updates
# See:
# https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/dependabot/dependabot-version-updates/configuration-options-for-the-dependabot.yml-file
#
# Supported ecosystems:
# - uv: Python dependencies via pyproject.toml and uv.lock (GA since March 2025)
# - github-actions: Workflow action versions
# - docker: Base images in Dockerfiles
#
# Note: Dependabot updates uv.lock but may not always update pyproject.toml version
# constraints. This is expected behavior - the lock file contains the actual pinned
# versions while pyproject.toml defines acceptable ranges.
# See: https://github.com/dependabot/dependabot-core/issues/12788
