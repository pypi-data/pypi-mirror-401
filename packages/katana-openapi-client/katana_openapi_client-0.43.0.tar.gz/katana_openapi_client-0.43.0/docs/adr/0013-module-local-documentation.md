# ADR-0013: Module-Local Documentation Structure

## Status

Accepted

Date: 2025-11-05

## Context

The monorepo had inconsistent documentation organization that made it difficult for
contributors to find relevant information and didn't align with modern Python monorepo
best practices.

### Problems with Previous Structure

1. **Documentation scattered across multiple locations**:

   - Client docs at root `docs/` (8 guides + 8 ADRs)
   - MCP docs split between `docs/mcp-server/` (5 files) and `katana_mcp_server/` (2
     files)
   - No clear module boundaries

1. **ADRs mixed by scope**:

   - Root `docs/adr/` contained client ADRs (001-008, 011-012), MCP ADR (010), and
     shared ADR (009)
   - Made it unclear which ADRs applied to which package

1. **Examples not organized by module**:

   - All examples in flat `examples/` directory
   - No separation between client and MCP examples

1. **Difficult to extract packages**:

   - Package-specific docs didn't travel with the package
   - Would need extensive refactoring to split packages into separate repos

1. **Questions about organization**:

   - "Where are the client docs?" → Unclear (some in root docs/, some might be
     elsewhere)
   - "Where are the MCP docs?" → Very unclear (split across 3 locations)
   - "Which ADRs apply to the client?" → Required reading all ADRs to determine

## Decision

We will reorganize documentation into a **module-local structure** where each package
has its own `docs/` subdirectory containing all module-specific documentation, including
ADRs.

### New Structure

```

### Implementation

1. Created `katana_public_api_client/docs/` and `katana_mcp_server/docs/` directories
1. Moved client docs and ADRs to client package
1. Moved MCP docs and ADRs to MCP package
1. Reorganized examples by module
1. Created symlinks from `docs/client/` and `docs/mcp-server/` to module docs
1. Updated all internal links and references
1. Updated `mkdocs.yml` navigation structure

## Consequences

### Positive Consequences

1. **Clear Module Boundaries**: Each package has complete, self-contained documentation
1. **Improved Discoverability**: Easy to find docs - client docs in client package, MCP
   docs in MCP package
1. **Better ADR Organization**: ADRs organized by scope (client/MCP/shared)
1. **Package Extractability**: Documentation travels with the package - could extract to
   separate repo without refactoring
1. **Consistent with Modern Practices**: Aligns with Python monorepo best practices
1. **Better mkdocs Integration**: Root `docs/` aggregates everything via symlinks
1. **Easier Navigation**: Clear navigation structure by module in documentation site

### Negative Consequences

1. **More Complex Directory Structure**: More directories to navigate (though better
   organized)
1. **Symlinks Required**: CI/CD must handle symlinks or copy files for documentation
   builds
1. **Cross-References**: Some documentation cross-references require relative paths
   (e.g., `../../`)

### Neutral Consequences

1. **Documentation Paths Changed**: All documentation paths updated - old
   bookmarks/links will break
1. **Git History**: File moves preserved in git history but may complicate some git
   operations

## Alternatives Considered

### Alternative 1: Keep Flat Structure

- **Description**: Keep all docs in root `docs/` directory with subdirectories for
  different topics
- **Pros**: Simpler structure, easier to browse all docs at once
- **Cons**: Doesn't scale to multiple packages, unclear ownership, difficult to extract
  packages
- **Why rejected**: Doesn't support monorepo evolution and package independence

### Alternative 2: Duplicate Documentation

- **Description**: Keep docs in both root `docs/` and package directories
- **Pros**: Easy to find docs in either location
- **Cons**: Synchronization nightmare, source-of-truth unclear, duplicated maintenance
- **Why rejected**: Unsustainable maintenance burden

### Alternative 3: Documentation in Separate Repo

- **Description**: Move all documentation to a separate repository
- **Pros**: Clean separation, focused documentation repo
- **Cons**: Docs far from code, version synchronization issues, harder to keep docs
  updated
- **Why rejected**: Best practice is to keep docs with code
