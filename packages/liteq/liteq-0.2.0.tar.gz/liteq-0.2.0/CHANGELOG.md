## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-10

### 🎉 Major Rewrite - Simplified API

This release represents a complete architectural simplification of LiteQ, focusing on minimalism and ease of use.

### Changed - BREAKING CHANGES
- **Removed `QueueManager`** - No longer needed, use CLI or direct Worker class instead
- **Removed `enqueue()` function** - Use `task.delay()` method instead
- **Removed `enqueue_many()` function** - Call `.delay()` multiple times or use database functions directly
- **Simplified task registration** - Tasks are now registered via `@task` decorator only
- **New execution model** - Use CLI `liteq worker` or programmatic `Worker.run()`

### Added
- **`@task` decorator** with `.delay()` method - Simple, Pythonic task enqueueing
- **CLI interface** - `liteq worker` command for running workers
- **Improved monitoring** - Enhanced monitoring functions in `liteq.monitoring`
- **Better documentation** - Complete rewrite of README and examples
- **92% test coverage** - Comprehensive test suite with pytest
- **Worker class** - Simplified `Worker(queues, concurrency)` for programmatic use
- **Database utilities** - Direct access via `liteq.db` module

### Fixed
- Cross-platform support in release script (Windows/Unix)
- Test isolation issues with shared database
- CLI worker import and execution
- Documentation accuracy

### Migration Guide from 0.1.x to 0.2.0

**Before (0.1.x):**
```python
from liteq import task, QueueManager, enqueue

@task(queue="emails")
async def send_email(to: str):
    ...

manager = QueueManager()
manager.initialize()
manager.add_worker("worker-1", queues=["emails"])

enqueue("send_email", {"to": "user@example.com"})
await manager.start()
```

**After (0.2.0):**
```python
from liteq import task
from liteq.db import init_db
from liteq.worker import Worker

@task(queue="emails")
async def send_email(to: str):
    ...

# Enqueue tasks
init_db()
send_email.delay(to="user@example.com")

# Run worker via CLI
# $ liteq worker --app tasks.py --queues emails

# Or programmatically
worker = Worker(queues=["emails"], concurrency=4)
worker.run()
```
