# Contributing to the Python Port

This repository accepts contributions that improve the existing
implementation or the test suite of the Python port.

Changes to the Open Asset Model itself or its base implementation must
be submitted upstream (see below).

Before opening a pull request, ensure that all existing unit tests
pass. Any new functionality should be accompanied by appropriate test

# Contributing Upstream

To propose changes to the model or its reference implementation,
please consult the CONTRIBUTING guidelines in the main repository and
submit your contribution there.
