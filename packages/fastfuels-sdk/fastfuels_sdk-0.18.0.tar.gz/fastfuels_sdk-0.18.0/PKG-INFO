# Python SDK for the FastFuels API

## Quick-Links

[Documentation](https://silvxlabs.github.io/fastfuels-sdk-python/) - [PyPi Package](https://pypi.org/project/fastfuels-sdk/) - [Project Description](https://www.firelab.org/project/fastfuels-3d-fuels-next-generation-fire-models)

## What is FastFuels?

FastFuels is an innovative solution that propels the use of advanced 3D fire
models into the future of fire and fuels management. It acts as a "3D fuels
superhighway," seamlessly merging existing data sources with cutting-edge
modeling to produce the detailed 3D fuel data required by these models. With
its unique ability to generate and manage comprehensive fuels data for large
areas, FastFuels enhances the precision and context of fire behavior insights
and management strategies. Moreover, it encourages the incorporation of new
data sources and techniques in the field, ensuring its relevance and
adaptability in the dynamic landscape of remote sensing and wildland fuels
science. Stay tuned as we continue to develop and refine FastFuels, paving the
way for next-generation fire models.
