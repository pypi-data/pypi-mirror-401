    This function ensures that all modifications within  the `with` block are applied together, or none are applied at all.

    transaction. If an exception occurs inside the block, or if the transaction is

    Returns
    -------
    AtomicManager
        A context manager that provides atomic context functionality.

    Examples
    --------
    Grouping successful operations:
    
    >>> obj1 = MyMemoClass("initial value")
    >>> with dbzero.atomic():
    ...     obj1.value = "updated value"
    ...     obj2 = MyMemoClass("new object")
    ...     dbzero.tags(obj2).add("new")
    >>> # Both changes are now visible
    >>> assert obj1.value == "updated value"

    Automatic rollback on exception:
    
    >>> obj = MyMemoClass(value=100)
    >>> try:
    ...     with dbzero.atomic():
    ...         obj.value = 200  # This change will be reverted
    ...         raise ValueError("Something went wrong")
    ... except ValueError:
    ...     print("Caught expected error.")
    >>> # The object's value is unchanged
    >>> assert obj.value == 100

    Manual rollback with cancel():
    
    >>> obj = MyMemoClass(value=100)
    >>> with dbzero.atomic() as atomic:
    ...     obj.value = 200
    ...     if obj.value > 150:
    ...         print("Value too high, canceling.")
    ...         atomic.cancel()
    >>> # The changes were discarded
    >>> assert obj.value == 100

    Notes
    -----
    An atomic() block does not immediately create a new, committed transaction or 
    increment the global state number. Instead, the changes are staged 
    and applied as part of the surrounding transaction, which is then committed 
    either manually via dbzero.commit() or by the autocommit mechanism.
