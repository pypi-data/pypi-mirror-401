    ----------

    --------

    Parameters
    ----------
    query : QueryObject
        A dbzero query.
    pre_snapshot : Snapshot or None
       The snapshot representing the starting point for the comparison.
        If None, returns an empty list since there's no initial state to compare against.
    last_snapshot : Snapshot
        The snapshot representing the ending point for the comparison.
    compare_with : callable, optional
        A custom comparator that takes two arguments: the object from pre_snapshot and the object 
        from last_snapshot. It should return True if the objects are considered unchanged.

    Returns
    -------
    Iterable[Tuple[Memo, Memo]]
        An iterable of tuples, where each tuple contains the "before" and "after" versions 
        of a modified object: (old_version, new_version). old_version is the object's state 
        from pre_snapshot, new_version is the object's state from last_snapshot.

    Examples
    --------
    Basic usage - find all modified districts:
    
    >>> # Initial state
    >>> district_a = District(name="Oldtown")
    >>> dbzero.commit()
    >>> snap_1 = dbzero.snapshot()
    >>> 
    >>> # Make a change
    >>> district_a.name = "Newtown"
    >>> dbzero.commit()
    >>> snap_2 = dbzero.snapshot()
    >>> 
    >>> # Find modified objects
    >>> modified_districts = dbzero.select_modified(dbzero.find(District), snap_1, snap_2)
    >>> 
    >>> for old_ver, new_ver in modified_districts:
    ...     print(f"District name changed from '{old_ver.name}' to '{new_ver.name}'")
    ...     assert old_ver.name == "Oldtown"
    ...     assert new_ver.name == "Newtown"

    Advanced usage - custom comparison logic:
    
    >>> class Product:
    ...     def __init__(self, name, price, last_updated):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...         self.price = price
    ...         self.last_updated = last_updated
    >>> 
    >>> # Initial state
    >>> product = Product(name="Laptop", price=1200, last_updated=1672531200)
    >>> dbzero.commit()
    >>> snap_1 = dbzero.snapshot()
    >>> 
    >>> # Modify only the timestamp
    >>> product.last_updated = 1672617600
    >>> dbzero.commit()
    >>> snap_2 = dbzero.snapshot()
    >>> 
    >>> # Custom comparison function
    >>> def a_meaningful_change(obj1, obj2):
    ...     # Return True if only the timestamp is different (i.e., they are "equal" for our purposes)
    ...     return obj1.name == obj2.name and obj1.price == obj2.price
    >>> 
    >>> # This will find no "meaningful" modifications
    >>> results = dbzero.select_modified(dbzero.find(Product), snap_1, snap_2, compare_with=a_meaningful_change)
