def async_wait(prefix: str, state_num: int) -> asyncio.Future:
    """Pause an asyncio coroutine until a specific data prefix reaches a target state number.

    Async variant of `dbzero.wait` function, suitable for use in coroutines.

    Parameters
    ----------
    prefix : str
        Name of the prefix to monitor for changes.
    state_num : int
        Target state number to wait for.

    Returns
    -------
    asyncio.Future[None]
        An awaitable object (asyncio.Future).
        Awaiting this future blocks the coroutine until prefix state number is reached.

    Examples
    --------
    Waiting for the next state change:
    
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> # Get the current state number of the default prefix
    >>> current_state = dbzero.get_state_num("default")
    >>> print("Waiting for the next commit...")
    >>> 
    >>> # In another part of your code, make and commit a change
    >>> obj = MyMemoClass(value="initial")
    >>> obj.value = "updated"  # This mutation will increment the state number on commit
    >>> # dbzero automatically commits the change
    >>> 
    >>> await dbzero.async_wait("default", current_state + 1)
    >>> print("State change detected!")

    Timeout handling:
    
    >>> import asyncio
    >>> prefix_name = "default"
    >>> current_state = dbzero.get_state_num(prefix_name)
    >>> 
    >>> # Wait for a future state with timeout protection
    >>> try:
    ...     await asyncio.wait_for(
    ...         asyncio.shield(dbzero.async_wait(prefix_name, current_state + 1)),
    ...         timeout=5.0

    Allows to capture information about prefix modifications and their current state. This information
    can be used for synchronizing reader processes or analyzing what mutatons take place in a block of
    operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    await_commit : bool, default False
        If True, the context manager will wait asynchronously until changes made in the locked
        block are committed. Setting this parameter to True is only allowed in `async with` statement.

        **With autocommit disabled, the commit is triggered automatically when closing context manager
        to ensure expected behavior**

    Returns
    -------
    LockedManager
        A context manager that can be used with either `with` (synchronous) or 
        `async with` (asynchronous) statements.

    Examples
    --------
    Synchronous mutation analysis:
    
    >>> # Create some objects in different prefixes
    >>> obj_1 = MemoTestClass(951)
    >>> dbzero.open("some-new-prefix", "rw")
    >>> obj_2 = MemoTestClass(952)
    >>>

    ...     # A read operation does not create a log entry
    ...     x = obj_1.value
    ...     # A mutating operation does
    ...     obj_2.value = 123123
    >>> 
    >>> # After the block, get the mutation log
    >>> mutation_log = lock.get_mutation_log()
    >>> # The log shows that only "some-new-prefix" was modified
    >>> assert len(mutation_log) == 1
    >>> assert mutation_log[0][0] == "some-new-prefix"

    Asynchronous commit waiting:
    
    >>> obj = MemoTestClass(1234)
    >>> dbzero.commit()  # Ensure initial state is saved
    >>> 
    >>> # Get the number that the *next* commit will have
    >>> next_state_num = dbzero.get_state_num()
    >>> 
    >>> # This async block will pause until the change to `obj` is committed
    >>> async with dbzero.locked(await_commit=True):
    ...     obj.value = 5678
    >>> 
    >>> # Code here will only run after the commit is complete
    >>> print("Commit finished!")
    >>> # We can verify that the state number has advanced as expected
    >>> assert dbzero.get_state_num(finalized=True) == next_state_num

    Notes
    -----
    This function can be used as a lightweight alternative to `dbzero.atomic`,
    with a difference that it doesn't revert changes in case an error occurs.
