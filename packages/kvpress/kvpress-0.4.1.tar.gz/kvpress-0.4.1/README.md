![kvpress](kvpress.jpg)


Deploying long-context LLMs is costly due to the linear growth of the key-value (KV) cache in transformer models. For example, handling 1M tokens with Llama 3.1-70B in float16 requires up to 330GB of memory. kvpress implements multiple KV cache compression methods and benchmarks using 🤗 transformers, aiming to simplify the development of new methods for researchers and developers in this field.

## Installation

```bash
pip install kvpress
```

For a local installation with all dev dependencies, use uv:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/kvpress.git
cd kvpress
uv sync --all-groups
```

Advanced installation settings
</summary>

To install optional packages, you can use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). 
To install with flash attention, just run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/kvpress.git
cd kvpress
uv sync --extra flash-attn
```

To install with dependencies for evaluation, run 

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NVIDIA/kvpress.git
cd kvpress
uv sync --extra eval
```
</details>

## Usage

KVPress provides a set of "presses" that compress the KV cache during the prefilling-phase. Each press is associated with a `compression_ratio` attribute that measures the compression of the cache. The easiest way to use a press is through our custom `KVPressTextGenerationPipeline`. It is automatically registered as a transformers pipeline with the name "kv-press-text-generation" when kvpress is imported and handles chat templates and tokenization for you:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from kvpress import ExpectedAttentionPress

model = "Qwen/Qwen3-8B"
pipe = pipeline("kv-press-text-generation", model=model, device_map="auto", dtype="auto")

context = "A very long text you want to compress once and for all"
question = "\nA question about the compressed context"  # optional

press = ExpectedAttentionPress(compression_ratio=0.5)
answer = pipe(context, question=question, press=press)["answer"]
```

In the snippet above, the compression is only applied on the context tokens so that you can evaluate the compression for different questions. Check the [Wikipedia notebook demo](notebooks/wikipedia_demo.ipynb) for a more detailed example (also available on Colab [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1JNvaTKuuAHrl49dYB9-mdEH_y52Ib-NP)).

Decoding Compression
</summary>
By default, KVPress applies compression during the prefilling phase. As a new (experimental) feature, we now support decoding compression via the `DecodingPress` wrapper. `DecodingPress` compresses the KV cache periodically during token generation, optionally maintaining a buffer of recent hidden states. `DecodingPress` supports the following parameters:

- `base_press`: Any ScorerPress (e.g., `KNormPress`, `CriticalKVPress`)
- `compression_interval`: Steps between compressions (default: 10)
- `target_size`: Target cache size of the cache after compression (default: 1024)
- `hidden_states_buffer_size`: Number of hidden states to buffer before compression (default: 128). Some presses don't need buffered hidden states and can set this to 0.

Unlike a compression ratio, decoding press uses a `target_size` to compress the cache. This means that the cache is compressed every `compression_interval` steps, and the compression ratio is automatically computed such that the size of the cache after compression equals `target_size`.

An example for decoding compression:

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from kvpress import KnormPress
from kvpress import DecodingPress

# Initialize the pipeline
device = "cuda:0"
model = "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
model_kwargs = {"attn_implementation": "flash_attention_2"}
pipe = pipeline("kv-press-text-generation", model=model, device=device, model_kwargs=model_kwargs)

# Create a decoding press that compresses every 10 steps to 512 tokens
decoding_press = DecodingPress(
    base_press=KnormPress(),
    compression_steps=10,
    token_buffer_size=512
)

# Use with pipeline
context = "A very long text you want to compress during generation"
question = "Tell me a long story about this context"
response = pipe(context, question=question, press=decoding_press)["answer"]
```

> Not all existing presses are fully compatible with DecodingPress due to fundamental differences in how compression works during decoding versus prefilling. in particular, we only support ScorerPresses as base presses.

</details>

## Available presses

All current presses are training free and inherit from `BasePress` ([source](kvpress/presses/base_press.py)). 

Several presses inherit from `ScorerPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/scorer_press.py)) and rely on a score to prune the KV pairs with lowest importance:

- `RandomPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/random_press.py)): random score

- `LeverageScorePress` ([source](kvpress/presses/leverage_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08143)): evicts tokens based on approximate statistical leverage (i.e we preserve outliers in the key space).
- `CompactorPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/compactor_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08143)): blends `NonCausalAttnPress` and `LeverageScorePress` based on the compression_ratio.
- `CURPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/cur_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15038)): prune keys and values based on the CUR decomposition using approximate leverage scores.

Some presses rely on a different logic:
- `ThinKPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/think_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21018)): compress the dimensions of the keys based on the channel attention score on the last queries 
- `SimLayerKVPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/simlayerkv_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13846)): identify "lazy" layers, and apply the StreamingLLM approach to them 
- `DuoAttentionPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/duo_attention_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10819)): split heads into retrieval heads (no compression) and streaming heads (StreamingLLM approach)
- `FinchPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/finch_press.py), [paper](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00716/125280)): similar to SnapKV with a dynamic window size and key value re-rotation
- `KVzipPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/kvzip_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23416)): identifies redundant KV pairs through context reconstruction. Achieves near-lossless compression at the cost of multiple forward passes.

Finally we provide wrapper presses that can be combined with other presses:
- `AdaKVPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/adakv_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.11550)): prune bottom scores of any `ScorerPress` but across all heads, achieving head-wise compressions 
- `PerLayerCompressionPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/per_layer_compression_press.py)): compress each layer with a different compression ratio (experimental)
- `ComposedPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/composed_press.py)): compose multiple presses together by chaining their forward hooks
- `KeyRerotationPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/key_rerotation_press.py)): rerotate pruned keys to have continuous RoPE embeddings
- `ChunkKVPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/chunkkv_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00299)): compresses by selecting important chunks, preserving semantic coherence
- `ChunkPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/chunk_press.py), [paper](https://direct.mit.edu/tacl/article/doi/10.1162/tacl_a_00716/125280)): compress the KV cache on each sequence chunk separately. This can yield to more uniform compression across long sequences
- `CriticalKVPress` and `CriticalAdaKVPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/criticalkv_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03805)): refine the scores using the L1 norm of Wo @ values, coupled with a two-stage selection.
- `BlockPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/block_press.py), [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15364)): segments input sequence into non-overlapping blocks and compresses iteratively.
- `DecodingPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/decoding_press.py)): allows for compression during decoding, see decoding section in this README.
- `PrefillDecodingPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/prefill_decoding_press.py)): allows to compress both during prefilling and during decoding.
- `ThresholdPress` ([source](kvpress/presses/threshold_press.py)): evict keys and values with scores below a given threshold of any `ScorerPress` instead of relying on top-k scores. Support both prefilling and decoding (if decoding=True).

## Evaluation
We provide a simple CLI to evaluate the performance of different presses on several long-context datasets. 

- Accuracy: Test your method on popular benchmarks directly using our CLI. 
- Speed and Memory: The [speed_and_memory](notebooks/speed_and_memory.ipynb) notebook can help you measure peak memory usage and total time gain.

Please refer to the [evaluation](evaluation/README.md) directory in this repo for more details and results. 

Below we report the average performance on the RULER dataset with 4k context length for different presses, from our [![Hugging Face Leaderboard](https://img.shields.io/badge/🤗%20HuggingFace-Leaderboard-orange)](https://huggingface.co/spaces/nvidia/kvpress-leaderboard)

## Quantization

We support KV cache quantization through the transformers `QuantizedCache` class (see [HF blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/kv-cache-quantization#how-to-use-quantized-kv-cache-in-%F0%9F%A4%97-transformers)). To use it, simply pass a cache object to your pipeline:

```python
from transformers import QuantizedCacheConfig, QuantoQuantizedCache

config = QuantizedCacheConfig(nbits=4)
cache = QuantoQuantizedCache(config)

pipe(..., cache=cache)
```

By default, the `DynamicCache` is used (no quantization). 

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> To use the `QuantizedCache`, you need to install additional dependencies (_e.g._ `pip install optimum-quanto`).

## FAQ

<details><summary> 

### Which models are supported ? 
</summary>

Some presses depend on the model architecture (_e.g._ `ExpectedAttentionPress` or `SnapKVPress`) hence they might not work with all models. We tested support for `LlamaForCausalLM`, `MistralForCausalLM`, `Phi3ForCausalLM`, `Qwen2ForCausalLM`, `Qwen3ForCausalLM`, and `Gemma3ForCausalLM` but many other models might be supported out of the box because their implementation is often similar in transformers.
</details>

<details><summary> 

### How to run inference on multiple GPUs ? 
</summary>

kvpress supports multi-GPU inference through [accelerate](https://huggingface.co/docs/accelerate/en/index):

```python
pipe = pipeline("kv-press-text-generation", model=model, device_map="auto")
```

</details>


<details> <summary> 

### What are the memory and throughput gains ?
</summary>

Memory usage should be reduced by around `compression_ratio * kv_cache_size`. As the KV cache is smaller, decoding should also be faster. You can measure peak memory usage gain and total time gain using [this notebook](notebooks/speed_and_memory.ipynb).
</details>


<details> <summary> 

### How does a press work ? </summary>

A press registers a forward hook (`press.forward_hook` method) to each attention layer during the prefilling phase. Registration can be applied using the press as a context manager (`press.__call__` method):

```python
import torch
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
from kvpress import KnormPress

device = "cuda:0"
ckpt = "meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(ckpt).to(device)
press = KnormPress(compression_ratio=0.4)

inputs = model.dummy_inputs["input_ids"].to(device)

with torch.no_grad():
    print(model(inputs).past_key_values[0][0].shape)
    # torch.Size([3, 8, 5, 128])
    
with torch.no_grad(), press(model):
    print(model(inputs).past_key_values[0][0].shape)
    # torch.Size([3, 8, 3, 128])
```
</details>

<details><summary> 

### Why not using model.generate ? 
</summary>

In fact you can use `model.generate` with a press by using the press as a context manager:

```python
with press(model):
    outputs = model.generate(inputs)
```

However, the `generate` method does not allow to exclude the question from the compression, which would artificially favors methods such as SnapKV. Ideally, we want a compression method that works whatever comes after the context (_e.g._ for use cases such as chat or document question answering). Finally the `generate` method does not allow to provide generation for multiple questions at once.

</details>



<details><summary> 

### Can I combine compression during prefilling and decoding ? 
</summary>


Combines separate presses for prefilling and decoding phases.

**Parameters:**
- `prefilling_press`: Press used during prefill phase
- `decoding_press`: Press used during decoding phase

## Usage Examples

### Basic Decoding Compression

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from kvpress import KnormPress
from kvpress import DecodingPress

# Initialize the pipeline
device = "cuda:0"
model = "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
model_kwargs = {"attn_implementation": "flash_attention_2"}
pipe = pipeline("kv-press-text-generation", model=model, device=device, model_kwargs=model_kwargs)

# Create a decoding press that compresses every 10 steps to 512 tokens
decoding_press = DecodingPress(
    base_press=KnormPress(),
    compression_steps=10,
    token_buffer_size=512
)

# Use with pipeline
context = "A very long text you want to compress during generation"
question = "Tell me a long story about this context"
response = pipe(context, question=question, press=decoding_press)["answer"]
```

### Combined Prefill + Decoding Compression

```python
from transformers import pipeline
from kvpress import CriticalKVPress, KnormPress
from kvpress import DecodingPress, PrefillDecodingPress

# Initialize the pipeline
device = "cuda:0"
model = "meta-llama/Llama-3.1-8B-Instruct"
model_kwargs = {"attn_implementation": "flash_attention_2"}
pipe = pipeline("kv-press-text-generation", model=model, device=device, model_kwargs=model_kwargs)

# Different strategies for prefill vs decoding
prefill_press = CriticalKVPress(KnormPress())
decoding_press = DecodingPress(
    base_press=KnormPress(compression_ratio=0.2),
    compression_steps=5,
    token_buffer_size=256
)

# Combine them
combined_press = PrefillDecodingPress(
    prefilling_press=prefill_press,
    decoding_press=decoding_press
)

context = "A very long context that will be compressed during prefill"
question = "Generate a detailed analysis that will be compressed during decoding"
response = pipe(context, question=question, press=combined_press)["answer"]
```
