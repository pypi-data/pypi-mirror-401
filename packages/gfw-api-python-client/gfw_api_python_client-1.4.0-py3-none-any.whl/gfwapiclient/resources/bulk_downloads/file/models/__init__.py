"""Global Fishing Watch (GFW) API Python Client - Download bulk Report (URL File) Models.

This module defines Pydantic data models used for interacting with the Download bulk
Report (URL File) API endpoint. These models are used to represent request parameters
and response data when obtaining signed URL to download file(s) (i.e., `"DATA"`,
`"README"`, or `"GEOM"`) of the previously created bulk report.

For detailed information about the Download bulk Report (URL File) API endpoint,
please refer to the official Global Fishing Watch API documentation:
