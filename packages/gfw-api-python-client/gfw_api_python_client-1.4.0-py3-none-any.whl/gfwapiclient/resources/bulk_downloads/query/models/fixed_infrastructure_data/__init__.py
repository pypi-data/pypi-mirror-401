"""Global Fishing Watch (GFW) API Python Client - Query Bulk Fixed Infrastructure Data Models.

This module defines Pydantic data models used for interacting with the Query Bulk
Report API endpoint. These models are used to represent request parameters, and
response data when querying data in JSON format of the previously created
fixed infrastructure data (i.e `public-fixed-infrastructure-data:latest` dataset) bulk report.

For detailed information about the Query Bulk Report - API endpoint, please refer to
the official Global Fishing Watch API documentation:

For more details on the Query Bulk Report - data caveats, please refer to the
