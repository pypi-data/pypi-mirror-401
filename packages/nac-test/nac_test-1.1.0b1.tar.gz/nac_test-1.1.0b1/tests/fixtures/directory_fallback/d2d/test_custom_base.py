"""Test in /d2d/ directory with custom base for fallback testing.

This fixture has a class with a custom base class but is located
in a directory with '/d2d/' in its path. The resolver should:
1. Fail AST-based detection (custom base not in mapping)
2. Fall back to directory detection
3. Return 'd2d' based on the /d2d/ directory path
