class OrbitalCamera(gfx.PerspectiveCamera):
    r"""
    A custom orbital camera built off the pygfx library with keyboard control.

    Cameras in pygfx are seperated into two submodules: :mod:`pygfx.cameras` and :mod:`pygfx.controllers`. The former
    determines the view style (such as 2D vs 3D) and the latter how the camera moves in response to user input. To
    create an orbit camera (a camera which rotates around an object like it is orbiting it)
    :class:`pygfx.PerspectiveCamera` may be passed into :class:`pygfx.OrbitController`. However, this only implements
    mouse-based control.

    To remedy this, this class may be used. It is a child class of :class:`pygfx.PerspectiveCamera` and unlike a typical
    class from :mod:`pygfx.cameras` it implements its own movement dynamics via :meth:`ui.OrbitalCamera.orient()`
    without the need for a :mod:`pygfx.controller`. However, in-order for user movement commands to be processed this
    class must be used in conjunction with :class:`ui.RenderEngine` which is responsible for converting user input into
    commands readable by :meth:`ui.OrbitalCamera.orient()`. The camera's equations of motion are displayed in the Notes
    section of :meth:`ui.OrbitalCamera.orient()`.

    An orbit camera uses spherical coordinates (azimuth, elevation, and radius) to position itself with respect to
    a fixed central point, in this case :math`[x, y, z] = [0, 0, 0]` in the :class:`ui.RenderEngine`'s Cartesian
    coordinates, which the camera always points directly towards. Changing each of these has the following effects:

    - **radius**: moves the camera towards or away from the sphere. Represents the magnitude of the position vector between the camera and :math:`[0, 0, 0]`.

    - **azimuth**: rotates the camera left and right about the sphere. Represents the angle between the x-axis and a projection of the camera's radius into the xy-plane.

    - **elevation**: rotates the camera up and down about the sphere. Represents the angle between the projection of the camera's radius into the xy-plane and the position vector itself.

    def orient(self):
        r"""
        Implements the equations of motion for the camera.

        Takes in the current camera position in the frame of :class:`ui.RenderEngine` as Cartesian coordinates and
        converts these to spherical coordinates. These coordinates are then adjusted based on user input before being
        clamped and converted back to a new set of Carterian which is used to update the camera's position.

        Notes
        -----
        The equations of motion for the camera are computed in spherical coordinates [1]_ in which co-elevation is
        replaced with elevation. The structure of the equations is the same for azimuth :math:`\theta`, elevation
        :math:`\phi`, and radius :math:`\rho` so just azimuth is shown below as an example. The exact equation used
        depends on the current value of :attr:`ui.OrbitalCamera.azimuth_dynamics_flag` :math:`\text{FLAG}`.

        .. math::

            \text{FLAG} =
            \begin{cases}
                1,  & \dot{\theta}_{t+\Delta t} = \dot{\theta}_{t} + \ddot{\theta} \Delta t \\
                0,  & \dot{\theta}_{t+\Delta t} = \dot{\theta}_{t} e^{-\zeta_\theta \Delta t} \\
                -1, & \dot{\theta}_{t+\Delta t} = \dot{\theta}_{t} - \ddot{\theta} \Delta t
            \end{cases}

        .. math::

            \theta_{t+\Delta t} = \theta_{t}
                \text{clip}(\dot{\theta}_{t+\Delta t}, -\dot{\theta}_\max, \dot{\theta}_\max) \Delta t

        where :math:`\zeta_\theta`, :math:`\ddot{\theta}`, :math:`\dot{\theta}_\max` are
        :attr:`ui.OrbitalCamera.azimuth_damping`, :attr:`ui.OrbitalCamera.azimuth_accel`, and
        :attr:`ui.OrbitalCamera.max_azimuth_vel` respectively. These equations are discrete because their implementation
        in :meth:`ui.OrbitalCamera.orient()` is not called continuously but rather every :math:`\Delta t` seconds.

        In addition, the following bounds are placed on the state variables:

        .. math::
            \begin{aligned}
                0 &\le \theta < 2\pi \\
                -\tfrac{\pi}{2} + \varepsilon
                  &\le \phi
                  \le \tfrac{\pi}{2} - \varepsilon \\
                \rho_{\min}
                  &\le \rho < \infty
            \end{aligned}

        where :math:`\dot{\theta}_\min` is :attr:`ui.OrbitalCamera.min_radius` and :math:`\varepsilon = 1e^{-3}`. The
        latter is used to avoid numerical singularities that would occur when :math:`\phi = -\pi/2, \, \pi / 2` exactly.
