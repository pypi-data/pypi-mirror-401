class CowellPropagator(base.Propagator):
    """
    Propagator which simply numerically integrates the equations of motion of the orbit using scipy's solve_ivp(). By
    default, only the gravity of the central body is considered but unlike Keplerian methods perturbing forces may also
    be included.
        By default, RK45 (a Rune-Kutta method of the 5th-order with a 4th-order error estimate) is used for
    numerical integration.

    NOTE: Numerical integration's accuracy is wholly based on the solver tolerances unlike Keplerian methods. This is
    because integration error accumulates whereas the root-finding error used to implement analytic solution is
    constant. As a result much stricter tolerances are needed for the solver to maintain accuracy.
