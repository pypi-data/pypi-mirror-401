    """# 🌀 DBSCAN Walk-Forward Anomaly Detection
    ---

    The `detect_time_series_anomalies_dbscan` function implements a **density-based clustering** approach for time-series anomaly detection. It utilizes an **iterative walk-forward validation** strategy to identify data points that exist in "low-density" regions of the feature space.

    ## 📋 Functional Overview
    This function transforms a univariate time series into a high-dimensional feature space using **dynamic lags** and **rolling statistics**. It then applies the **DBSCAN** (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to distinguish between dense clusters of "normal" behavior and sparse "noise" points (anomalies).



    ## 🧠 Core Logic & Helper Utilities

    ### 1. Dynamic Feature Engineering (`get_dynamic_lags`)
    Instead of using fixed lags, the function uses the **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** to find the 10 most significant seasonal patterns in the data.
    * **Baseline:** Always includes lags 1, 2, and 3 to capture immediate momentum.
    * **Significance:** Uses a 75% confidence interval ($\\\\alpha=0.25$) to identify meaningful historical dependencies.

    ### 2. Automated Parameter Tuning (`find_optimal_epsilon`)
    DBSCAN is highly sensitive to the **Epsilon ($\\\\epsilon$)** parameter (the neighborhood radius). 
    * **Proxy Elbow Method:** The function automatically calculates $\\\\epsilon$ by analyzing the distance to the $k$-th nearest neighbor for all training points.
    * **Density Threshold:** It sets $\\\\epsilon$ at the **95th percentile** of these distances, ensuring that 95% of training data is considered "dense" while the most isolated 5% are candidates for noise.

    ### 3. Walk-Forward Iteration
    For each period in the `eval_period`:
    * **Feature Construction:** Builds a matrix containing the variable, its dynamic lags, rolling means, rolling standard deviations, and a linear trend component.
    * **Scaling:** Fits a `StandardScaler` **only on training data** to prevent data leakage.
    * **Novelty Detection:** Since DBSCAN cannot "predict" on new points, the function uses a **Nearest Neighbors proxy**. If the distance from a new test point to its $k$-th neighbor in the training set is greater than the trained $\\\\epsilon$, it is flagged as an anomaly.

    ## 📤 Key Output Columns
    * **`dbscan_score`**: The distance from the point to the $\\\\epsilon$ boundary (positive values indicate anomalies).
    * **`is_DBSCAN_anomaly`**: A boolean flag identifying outliers.
    * **Generated Features**: Includes all dynamic lags (`lagX`) and rolling statistics (`roll_mean_W`) used during the fit.

    ## 💡 Usage Context
    DBSCAN is exceptionally powerful for detecting **contextual anomalies**—points that might look "normal" in value but are "weird" given their recent history or seasonal context. Because it is density-based, it can find anomalies in non-linear or multi-modal distributions where simple percentile or Z-score methods would fail.

    ### ⚠️ Performance Note
    This model is computationally more intensive than statistical methods due to the iterative re-fitting of the `NearestNeighbors` and `DBSCAN` models. It is best suited for high-priority metrics where accuracy is more critical than processing speed."""
