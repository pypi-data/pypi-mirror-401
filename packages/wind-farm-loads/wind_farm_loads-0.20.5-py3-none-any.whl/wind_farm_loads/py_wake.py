    Compute the effective wind speed and Turbulence Intensity over a rotor.

    This function receives a grid, and then rotates it by the wind direction. Optionally,
    the grid is also rotated by the yaw and tilt of each turbine to align it with the rotor plane.
    Finally, the grid is translated to each rotor center and the flow map is computed.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sim_res : py_wake SimulationResult
        Simulation result computed by PyWake. Must follow a call to the wind farm model.
    grid : (M, N, 3) or (M, N, 3, Type) ndarray
        x, y and z coordinate of the grid points, before rotation by yaw and tilt.
        Typically generated by `make_rectangular_grid` or `make_polar_grid`.
        The first 2 dimensions cover the rotor, then there are x, y, z and finally (optionally) the turbine type.
        If the user passes a 3D array, the grid is assumed to be the same for all turbine types.
    align_in_yaw : bool, optional
        If `True` (default) the grid is aligned in yaw with the rotor plane.
    align_in_tilt : bool, optional
        If `True` (default) the grid is aligned in tilt with the rotor plane.
    axial_wind : bool, optional
        If `True` the axial wind speed and TI are returned. That is, the downstream wind speed computed by PyWake
        is multiplied by :math:`\cos(\mathrm{yaw}) \cos(\mathrm{tilt})`. The default is `False`.
    wt : int, (I) array_like, optional
        Wind turbines. Must be a subset of the one contained in `sim_res`.
        The default is `None`, which means to use all available wind turbines.
    wd : float, (L) array_like, optional
        Wind direction, in deg. Must be a subset of the one contained in `sim_res`.
        The default is `None`, which means to use all available wind directions.
    ws : float, (K) array_like, optional
        Wind speed. Must be a subset of the one contained in `sim_res`.
        The default is `None`, which means to use all available wind speeds.
    time : float, (Time) array_like, optional
        Time. Must be a subset of the one contained in `sim_res`.
        The default is `None`, which means to use all available time instants.
    dtype : data-type, optional
        The desired data-type for the result and some intermediate computations.
        The default is single precision, which should be enough for all outputs.
        The properties of each type can be checked with `np.finfo(np.float32(1.0))`.
    save_grid : bool, optional
        If `True` the grid will be saved for all inflow conditions. Since this comes at a significant
        memory cost, it is recommended to switch it on only for debug purposes.
        The default is `False`.
    use_single_precision : bool, optional
        If `True`, the PyWake flow map is computed in single precision.
        This leads to reduced memory and run time, but also to a loss of precision.
        The default is `False`.
    memory_GB : int or float, optional
        If the additional memory needed to compute the flow map is assumed to exceed `memory_GB` GB using
        simple models, then the flow map is split into a number of wind direction and/or point chunks to
        reduce the memory consumption.
        The default is 1 GB.
    n_cpu : int or None, optional
        Number of CPUs used to compute the flow map.
        If `None`, all available CPUs are used.
        The default is 1, since often it is the fastest option.

    Returns
    -------
    flow_map : xarray DataSet
        Effective wind speed, effective turbulence intensity and corresponding grid points
        for each turbine and flow case.
