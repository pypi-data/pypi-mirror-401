   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR DEPLOYMENT, REPLICATION, AND PROPAGATION

   1. Nomenclature.

      "License" designates the operational parameters for deployment,
      replication, and propagation as defined by Sections 1 through 9.

      "Licensor" designates the Architect or the entity authorized by
      the Architect to grant this Protocol.

      "Legal Entity" designates the union of the acting node and all
      other nodes that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that node. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" implies (i) the power, direct or indirect, to determine
      the trajectory of such entity, whether by contract or otherwise,
      or (ii) possession of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding equity, or (iii) beneficial ownership.

      "You" (or "Your") designates an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this Protocol.

      "Source" form designates the preferred state for modifying the
      system, including but not limited to source code, documentation
      source, and configuration matrices.

      "Object" form designates any state resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled binaries, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media formats.

      "Work" designates the artifact of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under this Protocol, as indicated by a
      classification notice that is included in or attached to the artifact.

      "Derivative Works" designates any artifact, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original artifact of authorship. For the purposes
      of this Protocol, Derivative Works shall not include artifacts that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" designates any artifact of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to the Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. "Submitted" means any form of electronic, verbal,
      or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives,
      including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists,
      source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed
      by, or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and
      improving the Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously
      marked or otherwise designated in writing by the copyright owner as
      "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" designates the Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by the Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright Protocol. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to replicate, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and propagate the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent Protocol. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Propagation. You may replicate and propagate copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      adhere to the following directives:

      (a) You must provide any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this Protocol; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You altered the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You propagate, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          propagation, then any Derivative Works that You propagate must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the Protocol. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You propagate, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the Protocol.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, replication, or propagation of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      replication, and propagation of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this Protocol.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This Protocol does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. ABSENCE OF ASSURANCE. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, the Licensor deploys the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS OBSERVED" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any assurances of
      STABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, OPERATIONAL VIABILITY, or SUITABILITY
      FOR A SPECIFIC REALITY. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or propagating the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this Protocol.
      THE ARCHITECT DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE INTEGRITY OF YOUR DATA.

   8. LIMITATION OF CONSEQUENCE. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      accountable to You for SYSTEMIC COLLAPSE, including any direct,
      indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
      character arising as a result of this License or out of the use
      or inability to use the Work (including but not limited to damages
      for LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE, OR DATA
      ENTROPY), even if such Contributor has been advised of the
      possibility of such catastrophic failure.

   9. ASSUMPTION OF INDEPENDENT RISK. While propagating the Work or
      Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee
      for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability
      obligations and/or rights consistent with this License. However,
      in accepting such obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf
      and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of any other
      Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold
      each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
      asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting
      any such warranty or additional liability.
