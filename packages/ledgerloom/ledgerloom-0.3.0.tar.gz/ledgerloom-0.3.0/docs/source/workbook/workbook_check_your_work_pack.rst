Optional: Check Your Work Pack (Ch01 Startup)
=============================================

This workbook is meant to be a *learning* experience, not a “gotcha” test.
If you have a low tolerance for frustration (or you just want to confirm you’re on the right track),
use the downloads below to compare your work against a known-good reference.

**Canonical dataset contract:** each Workbook chapter has a *canonical dataset* under
``examples/workbook/<chapter_slug>/`` — treat this as the answer key. The accompanying
“reference outputs” ZIPs are generated by running ``ledgerloom build --run-id r1`` for that
project and zipping the resulting ``outputs/r1`` (artifacts + trust), along with the canonical
exported input CSVs.

What you get
------------

1) **Completed spreadsheet (XLSX)** — the Chapter 1 “Startup” transactions already filled in,
   using the exact `transactions.csv` column headers LedgerLoom expects.

   - :download:`Download: completed Ch01 spreadsheet (XLSX) <../_static/ledgerloom_workbook_completed_ch01_startup.xlsx>`

2) **Reference outputs (ZIP)** — a small “check your work” pack containing:

   - the canonical exported inputs: ``inputs/transactions.csv`` and ``inputs/adjustments.csv``
   - the LedgerLoom artifacts produced by ``ledgerloom build``:

     - ``entries.csv``
     - ``trial_balance_unadjusted.csv``
     - ``trial_balance_adjusted.csv``
     - ``closing_entries.csv``
     - ``trial_balance_post_close.csv``

   - plus ``trust/run_meta.json`` and ``trust/manifest.json``

   - :download:`Download: reference outputs pack (ZIP) <../_static/ledgerloom_workbook_reference_outputs_ch01_startup.zip>`

Workbook Ch02 — Journal → Trial Balance (optional solution pack)
================================================================

This pack corresponds to the canonical dataset in::

   examples/workbook/ch02_journal_to_trial_balance

Use it if you want a reference answer key for Ch02.

Downloads
---------

* :download:`Download the completed Ch02 workbook spreadsheet (XLSX)<../_static/ledgerloom_workbook_completed_ch02_journal_to_trial_balance.xlsx>`

  This XLSX contains the **correct** Ch02 inputs in two tabs:

  * ``adjustments`` (matches ``inputs/2026-01/adjustments.csv``)

* :download:`Download the Ch02 reference outputs (ZIP)<../_static/ledgerloom_workbook_reference_outputs_ch02_journal_to_trial_balance.zip>`

  This ZIP contains:

  * The canonical input CSVs under ``inputs/2026-01/``
  * Canonical LedgerLoom artifacts under ``outputs/r1/artifacts/`` (entries + trial balances + closing + post-close TB)
  * Trust metadata under ``outputs/r1/trust/``

Ch03 — Adjusting entries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Completed spreadsheet (XLSX): :download:`ledgerloom_workbook_completed_ch03_adjusting_entries.xlsx <../_static/ledgerloom_workbook_completed_ch03_adjusting_entries.xlsx>`
- Reference outputs (ZIP): :download:`ledgerloom_workbook_reference_outputs_ch03_adjusting_entries.zip <../_static/ledgerloom_workbook_reference_outputs_ch03_adjusting_entries.zip>`

What’s inside the ZIP:

- ``inputs/2026-01/transactions.csv`` (same base transactions as Ch02)
- ``inputs/2026-01/adjustments.csv`` (canonical adjusting entries)
- ``outputs/r1/`` (check report + canonical artifacts + trust manifest)

Ch04 — Closing and post-close
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Completed spreadsheet (XLSX): :download:`ledgerloom_workbook_completed_ch04_closing_and_post_close.xlsx <../_static/ledgerloom_workbook_completed_ch04_closing_and_post_close.xlsx>`
- Reference outputs (ZIP): :download:`ledgerloom_workbook_reference_outputs_ch04_closing_and_post_close.zip <../_static/ledgerloom_workbook_reference_outputs_ch04_closing_and_post_close.zip>`

What’s inside the ZIP:

- ``inputs/2026-01/transactions.csv`` (includes dividends)
- ``inputs/2026-01/adjustments.csv`` (canonical adjusting entries)
- ``outputs/r1/`` (check report + canonical artifacts + trust manifest)

How to use it
-------------

**Option A — “I just want to see the right data”**

Download the completed XLSX and compare it to your spreadsheet:

- same column names
- same rows
- same debit/credit amounts

**Option B — “I want to verify my LedgerLoom run”**

1. Run your project:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ledgerloom build --project path/to/your_project --run-id myrun

2. Open the artifacts folder:

   ``path/to/your_project/outputs/myrun/artifacts``

3. Compare your generated CSVs against the ones in the ZIP pack.

Notes for instructors
---------------------

If you are using LedgerLoom for graded work, consider telling students *when* they may use this pack
(e.g., “after submitting your own attempt”).
