Practical tooling
=================

This section documents LedgerLoom's "practical tool" surface area.

The practical tool is designed for **accountants**, **developers**, and **data professionals**:

* Accountants get a familiar workflow (period folders, exception lists, reviewable reports).
* Developers get deterministic outputs and an auditable pipeline.
* Data pros get tidy tables suitable for analysis.
