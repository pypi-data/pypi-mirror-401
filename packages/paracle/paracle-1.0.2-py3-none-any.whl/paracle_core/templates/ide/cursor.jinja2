## Cursor-Specific Features for .parac/ Integration

### Essential Keyboard Shortcuts
- **`Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`** - Inline edits (quick changes)
- **`Cmd+L` / `Ctrl+L`** - Chat sidebar (multi-turn conversation)
- **`Cmd+I` / `Ctrl+I`** - Composer (multi-file edits)
- **`@` mentions** - Reference specific files/folders

### Leveraging .parac/ with @ Mentions

**Before starting ANY task - Check governance:**
```
@.parac/GOVERNANCE.md What are the governance rules?
@.parac/memory/context/current_state.yaml What's the current state?
@.parac/roadmap/roadmap.yaml What phase are we in?
```

**When adopting agent persona:**
```
@.parac/agents/manifest.yaml Which agent should I use?
@.parac/agents/specs/coder.md Show coder responsibilities
@.parac/agents/SKILL_ASSIGNMENTS.md What skills does coder have?
```

**For implementation guidance:**
```
@.parac/policies/CODE_STYLE.md Code style guide
@.parac/policies/TESTING.md Testing policy
@content/docs/architecture.md Architecture patterns
```

**After actions - MANDATORY logging:**
```
@.parac/memory/logs/agent_actions.log
[2026-01-04 15:30:00] [CoderAgent] [IMPLEMENTATION] Description...
```

### Composer Workflow (`Cmd+I`)

1. **Start with context** (use @ mentions):
   - `@.parac/memory/context/current_state.yaml` - Current state
   - `@.parac/agents/specs/{agent}.md` - Agent responsibilities
   - `@.parac/roadmap/roadmap.yaml` - Current priorities

2. **Use @codebase for discovery**:
   - `@codebase Where is workflow engine?`
   - `@codebase Show similar patterns`

3. **Reference architecture**:
   - `@content/docs/architecture.md` - Hexagonal architecture
   - `@.parac/memory/knowledge/architecture.md` - Design decisions

4. **After changes - LOG immediately**:
   - Add entry to `@.parac/memory/logs/agent_actions.log`

### Chat Sidebar Tips (`Cmd+L`)

**Start every session with context:**
```
User: "Check @.parac/GOVERNANCE.md and @.parac/memory/context/current_state.yaml
first, then help me with [task]"
```

**Multi-turn conversations - keep .parac/ in context:**
- Reference agent specs during discussion
- Check policies before suggesting solutions
- Validate against current_state.yaml
- Log all significant outcomes

### Inline Edit Tips (`Cmd+K`)

For quick edits:
1. Select code to edit
2. Press `Cmd+K` / `Ctrl+K`
3. Reference agent standards in prompt
4. After edit, log to agent_actions.log

### Recommended Complete Workflow

1. **Pre-work** (`Cmd+L` Chat):
   ```
   @.parac/GOVERNANCE.md
   @.parac/memory/context/current_state.yaml
   @.parac/roadmap/roadmap.yaml

   What should I know before working on [task]?
   ```

2. **Agent Selection** (`Cmd+L` Chat):
   ```
   @.parac/agents/manifest.yaml

   Which agent should handle [task type]?
   Then show me @.parac/agents/specs/{selected_agent}.md
   ```

3. **Implementation** (`Cmd+I` Composer):
   - Multi-file changes with full context
   - Reference policies and architecture docs
   - Follow agent standards

4. **Post-work** (Manual or `Cmd+L`):
   ```
   Log to @.parac/memory/logs/agent_actions.log:
   [TIMESTAMP] [AGENT] [ACTION] What I did and where

   Update @.parac/memory/context/current_state.yaml if needed
   ```
