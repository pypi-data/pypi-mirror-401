"""
Contains the functions to apply setpoints based on the Adaptive Predicted Mean Vote (aPMV) index.
Unified version supporting EnergyPlus versions pre and post 23.1.

This module implements a robust logic to identify target zones or spaces based on the
Global Model Hierarchy (Space > ZoneList > Zone) and generates the necessary
EnergyManagementSystem (EMS) objects to control thermal comfort dynamically.

# ==============================================================================
# MONKEY PATCH FOR BESOS (Suppress Errors Only)
# ==============================================================================
# Rationale:
# BESOS uses a strict regex parser to read the EnergyPlus output file (.eso).
# However, EnergyPlus outputs can sometimes contain formats that break this parser,
# such as:
#   1. Empty units "[]" (common for dimensionless variables like PMV).
#   2. Duplicate variable definitions (if multiple objects request the same variable).
#   3. Trailing schedule names in the variable definition line.
#
# Instead of modifying the .eso file (which risks corrupting the dictionary index
# used by other tools like ESOView), this patch wraps the read function.
# It attempts to read the file, and if BESOS raises an exception, it catches it,
# issues a warning, and returns None. This allows the simulation script to continue
# executing (e.g., generating the IDF) even if the results parsing fails.

    # 1. Store the reference to the original, unmodified function from BESOS.

        :param out_dir: The directory path where the simulation output is located.
        :param file_name: The name of the results file (default: 'eplusout.eso').

    Analyzes the IDF to find all 'People' objects and resolves their target Zones or Spaces

    compatibility with both legacy (Zone-based) and modern (Space-based) EnergyPlus versions.

    1. GLOBAL CHECK: Are there SPACE or SPACELIST objects in the model?

         (Even if People are assigned to a ZoneList, we find the spaces inside those zones).

    2. ELSE: Are there ZONELIST objects in the model?
       - YES: The model uses ZoneLists for grouping.
         If People assigned to ZoneList -> Expand to 'ZoneName PeopleName'.
         If People assigned to Zone     -> Use 'ZoneName' (Sensor uses PeopleName).

    3. ELSE:
       - The model is simple (Zones only).
         Target resolves to 'ZoneName' (Sensor uses PeopleName).

    :param building: The BESOS/eppy IDF object representing the building model.
    :return: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a target control unit:
             - 'df_key': Unique identifier for user input DataFrames (e.g., "Space1 People1").
