"""
Hooks - Monkey-patch standard libraries to emit EgressEvent

All hooks generate EgressEvent and route through EgressEngine.
This ensures unified audit/policy for "AI touching reality".

Available hooks:
- httpx_patch: HTTP requests (httpx library)
- requests_patch: HTTP requests (requests library)
- subprocess_patch: Subprocess execution
- os_patch: File system operations
