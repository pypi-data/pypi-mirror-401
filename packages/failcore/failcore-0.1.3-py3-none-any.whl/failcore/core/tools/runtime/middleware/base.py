class Middleware(ABC):
    """
    Base class for ToolRuntime middleware.

    Middleware lifecycle (per tool call):

        1. on_call_start   (pre-execution)
           - Can observe the call
           - Can emit ToolEvent
           - MAY return ToolResult to short-circuit execution
             (e.g. replay/cache hit)

        2. on_call_success (post-execution, success or early-return)
           - Receives final ToolResult
           - Should NOT modify ToolResult in-place

        3. on_call_error   (post-execution, exception path)
           - Observes raised exception
           - Used for audit/logging/metrics/cleanup

    IMPORTANT RULES:
        - Middleware MUST be side-effect free with respect to runtime control flow,
          except via the explicit short-circuit return in on_call_start.
        - Middleware should NOT mutate CallContext.
        - Middleware should NOT generate ToolEvent.seq by itself.
