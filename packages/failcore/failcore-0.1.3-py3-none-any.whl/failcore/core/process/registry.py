"""
Process Registry - tracks owned PIDs for a run session

This registry is run-scoped and tracks which processes were spawned
by the current session. It's used to enforce process ownership policies:
only allow killing processes that were spawned by the current session.

Provides robust cleanup using failcore.utils.process for proper resource management.
