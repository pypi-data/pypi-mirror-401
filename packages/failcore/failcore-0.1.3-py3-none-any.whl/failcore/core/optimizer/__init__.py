"""
Trace-based Tool Optimizer

Engineering efficiency optimization based on trace analysis.
NOT a security feature - focuses on performance and cost reduction.

Features:
- Detect repeated tool calls (with write barrier awareness)
- Identify redundant parameters
- Suggest caching opportunities (respecting resource mutations)
- Provide actionable optimization advice

NO automatic path changes - only verified suggestions.
NO complex ML - simple pattern matching.

Correctness guarantees:
- Write barriers prevent stale cache suggestions
- Determinism checks ensure safe caching (three-state)
- Resource tracking for accurate analysis (normalized paths)
