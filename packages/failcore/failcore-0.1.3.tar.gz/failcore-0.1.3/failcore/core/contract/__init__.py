"""
Contract layer - Semantic validation and drift detection

This layer provides:
- Contract validation rules (kind, schema, etc.)
- Structured results for trace integration
- Clear decision semantics (OK, WARN, BLOCK)

It does NOT handle:
- Trace recording (that's trace/)
- Policy enforcement (that's policy/)
- Execution flow (that's executor/)
