# failcore/core/executor/state.py
"""
Execution State and Services - context and dependency injection

This module defines:
- ExecutionState: Execution context state passed between stages
- ExecutionServices: Explicit service interface (adopts suggestion 5)

Design principle:
- Stage receives only allowed services, not full executor
- Prevents stages from accessing executor private state
