"""
Replay Execution Hook - pure decision logic without trace dependencies

This module provides ReplayExecutionHook which only makes replay decisions
without recording trace events. Event recording is handled by the calling stage.

Design principle (adopts suggestion 2):
- Hook makes decisions, Stage records events
- Replay module does not depend on trace schema
