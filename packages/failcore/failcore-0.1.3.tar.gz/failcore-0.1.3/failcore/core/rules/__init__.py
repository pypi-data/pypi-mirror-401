"""
Core Rules - Neutral decision rules layer

This layer contains shared rule definitions used by both gates and enrichers.
It is dependency-neutral and sits below both guards and enrichers.

Architecture:
- rules/dlp     - DLP pattern definitions
- rules/semantic - Semantic rule definitions  
- rules/effects  - Side-effect type definitions
- rules/schemas  - Unified field schemas

Design principles:
1. Rules are declarative data, not execution logic
2. Both gates (decision) and enrichers (evidence) use same rules
3. No dependencies on guards or enrichers
4. Version-controlled rule definitions
