"""
Unified Schemas - Canonical field definitions

Defines schema structures shared across gates and enrichers to ensure
event model consistency between preflight and egress boundaries.

Design principles:
1. Target has inferred (from params) and observed (from execution) variants
2. Verdict is written only by gates (preflight or egress)
3. Evidence is written only by enrichers (post-execution)
4. Schema enforces semantic constraints on field usage
