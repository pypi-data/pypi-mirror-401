"""
Core Gate - Abstract gate interface

Gate is the authoritative decision point that writes VERDICT.
There are two types of gates:
1. Preflight Gate - at tool call boundary (guards implementation)
2. Egress Gate - at proxy/network boundary (proxy implementation)

Architecture principles:
1. Gate is the ONLY entity that can write VERDICT
2. Both gate types share same decision semantics
3. Both produce homogeneous ATTEMPT events
4. Decision based on shared rules (core/rules)

This design solves "proxy mode losing blocking capability" problem by
elevating decision authority from "guards" to abstract "Gate".
