    Abstract Gate protocol
    
    All gates (preflight or egress) must implement this interface.
    
    Architecture constraint:
    - Gate is the ONLY entity allowed to write VERDICT
    - Gate must produce AttemptEvent regardless of verdict (for audit trail)
    - Gate verdict is final and authoritative
    
    Usage:
    ```python
    gate = PreflightGate(rules=...)
    context = GateContext(tool="write_file", params={...})
    verdict = gate.check(context)
    
    if verdict.action == VerdictAction.BLOCK:
