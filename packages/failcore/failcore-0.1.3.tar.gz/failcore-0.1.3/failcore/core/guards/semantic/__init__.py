"""
Semantic Intent Guard

High-confidence semantic validation for tool calls.
Only covers extremely rare, 100% malicious scenarios:
- Secret leakage
- Parameter pollution
- Dangerous command combinations

Default: DISABLED. Enable only when needed.
All verdicts are explainable and auditable.

NOTE: Rule definitions moved to core/rules for sharing. Import from:
