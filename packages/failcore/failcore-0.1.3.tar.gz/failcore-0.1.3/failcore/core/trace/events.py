    Trace event step status (event-level semantics)
    
    This enum represents the status of a step as recorded in trace events.
    It extends execution-level StepStatus with trace-specific states like
    REPLAYED and SKIPPED, which are event-level observations rather than
    execution results.
    
    Design principle:
    - Execution status (StepStatus): ok/fail/blocked (execution result)
    - Event status (TraceStepStatus): ok/fail/blocked/skipped/replayed (trace observation)
    - Use map_step_status_to_trace() to convert StepStatus → TraceStepStatus
