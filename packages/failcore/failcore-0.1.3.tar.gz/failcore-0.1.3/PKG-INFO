           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
              and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.
        
              "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by

              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
              outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License.
        
              Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
              hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
              royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
              Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
              and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object
              form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License.
        
              Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
              hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
              royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
              license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
              otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
              patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
              infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
              Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
              submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
              (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
              the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
              direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution.
        
              You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative
              Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
              Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions.
        
              Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
              submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be
              under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
              terms or conditions.
        
           6. Trademarks.
        
              This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
              trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
        
              Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
              provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)
              on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
              either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
              warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
              or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability.
        
              In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including
              negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by applicable law
              (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to in writing,
              shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any direct,
              indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character
              arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability to use
              the Work.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
        
              While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose
              to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty,
              indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with
              this License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf of
              any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify, defend, and
              hold each Contributor harmless for any liability incurred by, or claims
              asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your accepting any such
              warranty or additional liability.

# FailCore

**When your agent breaks, you don't need better prompts — you need to know what it actually did.**

FailCore is an **execution-time tracing and safety runtime** for LLM systems.

It does not care how agents *reason* or *plan*.  
It focuses on **what was actually executed**, **what was blocked**, and **how to audit it after the fact**.

> ⚠️ **Pre-release (0.1.x)**  
> FailCore is under active development. APIs, CLI commands, and report formats may change.

---

## Why FailCore?

Most agent frameworks focus on *decision making*.  
FailCore focuses on the **moment actions touch the real world**.

**Without FailCore:**
- ❌ Tool failures are buried in logs
- ❌ Unsafe side effects are only discovered after damage
- ❌ No execution-level audit trail
- ❌ Debugging requires re-running expensive agents

**With FailCore:**
- ✅ **Execution-time enforcement** — block unsafe actions before they run
- ✅ **Structured tracing** — every action recorded as evidence
- ✅ **Clear outcomes** — `BLOCKED` vs `FAIL`
- ✅ **Forensic reports** — inspect incidents offline
- ✅ **Proxy-first design** — observe real traffic, not demos

---

## Core Concept

FailCore acts as a **runtime safety layer** between:
- LLM frameworks / SDKs  
- and the real world (filesystem, network, processes)

It is **not** an agent framework.  
It is a **guardrail, recorder, and black box**.

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install failcore
```

> ⚠️ Intended for evaluation and experimentation.

---

## Proxy-First Usage (Recommended)

FailCore is primarily designed to run as a **local proxy** in front of LLM SDKs.

```bash
pip install "failcore[proxy]"
```

```bash
failcore proxy
```

Configure your LLM client to route requests through FailCore.
All tool calls, streaming output, and side effects are traced and audited.

---

## Minimal Runtime API

FailCore no longer exposes session-style APIs.

The core primitives are:

```python
from failcore import run, guard
```

Example (filesystem protection):

```python
from failcore import run, guard

with run(policy="fs_safe", strict=True) as ctx:
    @guard()
    def write_file(path: str, content: str):
        with open(path, "w") as f:
            f.write(content)
    
    write_file("../etc/passwd", "hack")
```

Result:
- Execution is **blocked**
- Evidence is recorded
- Trace is persisted for inspection

---

## Inspect Traces

```bash
failcore list
failcore show
failcore report
failcore replay run <trace>
failcore replay diff <trace>
```

---

## Optional Integrations

### LangChain

```bash
pip install "failcore[langchain]"
```

FailCore can wrap LangChain tools to enforce execution-time safety and tracing.

---

## Who Is This For?

- 🔒 Developers running LLMs with real side effects
- 🐛 Debugging agent failures and hallucinated actions
- 📊 Auditing and post-mortem analysis
- 🧯 Adding a safety airbag to agent systems
