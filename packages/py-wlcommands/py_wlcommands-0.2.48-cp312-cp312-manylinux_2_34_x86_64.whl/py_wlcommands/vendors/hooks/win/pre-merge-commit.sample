:: An example hook script to verify what is about to be committed on Windows
:: Called by "git merge" with no arguments.  The hook should
:: exit with non-zero status after issuing an appropriate message to
:: stderr if it wants to stop the merge commit.

:: To enable this hook, rename this file to "pre-merge-commit".

:: Get the pre-commit hook path
