    ## Description

    Penalty Kick tasks a humanoid robot with executing a simplified penalty kick in a soccer environment. The robot must approach
    the ball, position itself for an optimal strike, and apply controlled force to direct the ball toward the opponent’s goal. Throughout
    the episode, it must balance offensive play with precision, generating velocity toward the goal while avoiding penalties such as
    going offside, making excessive or inefficient ball contacts and falling.

    The task demands precise positioning to close in on the ball, dynamic control to deliver an effective and well-aimed kick, and strategic
    movement to navigate the field, all within a continuous and high-dimensional action and observation space.

    ## Observation Space
    The observation space consists of the following parts (in order):

    - *qpos:* Position values of the robot's body parts. The dimensionality depends on the robot's joint configuration.
    - *qvel:* The velocities of these individual body parts (their derivatives). The dimensionality depends on the robot's joint configuration.
    - *field_dimensions (5 elements):* Field length, width, goal width, goal height, and goal depth.
    - *ball_xpos (3 elements):* The ball’s position in the world frame.
    - *ball_velp (3 elements):* The ball’s linear velocity in the world frame.
    - *ball_velr (3 elements):* The ball’s angular velocity (rotation) in the world frame.
    - *player_team (2 elements):* One-hot encoded vector indicating the player’s team.
    - *ball_to_goal_relpos* (3 elements):* Vector from the ball to the center of the goal.

    The order of elements in the observation space related to the environment is as follows -

    | Num | Observation                   | Min  | Max | Type (Unit)              |

    | 10  | Ball linear velocity z        | -Inf | Inf | velocity (m/s)           |
    | 11  | Ball angular velocity x       | -Inf | Inf | angular velocity (rad/s) |
    | 12  | Ball angular velocity y       | -Inf | Inf | angular velocity (rad/s) |
    | 13  | Ball angular velocity z       | -Inf | Inf | angular velocity (rad/s) |
    | 14  | Player team (one-hot: team 0) | 0    | 1   | binary indicator         |

    | 18  | Ball-to-goal relative z       | -Inf | Inf | position difference (m)  |

    ## Rewards

    The reward components include:

        1. `r_robot_distance_ball` (weight: 10.0): Encourages the robot to reduce its distance to the ball for better control.
        2. `r_ball_vel_twd_goal` (weight: 1.0): Rewards the ball’s velocity towards the opponent’s goal, promoting offensive play.
        3. `r_goal_scored` (weight: +25.0): Provides a large positive reward when the ball successfully enters the goal.
        4. `r_offside` (weight: -10.0): Penalizes when the ball is out of bounds or in an offside position, discouraging unproductive positioning.
        5. `r_ball_hits` (weight: -1.0): Applies a small penalty for repeated ball contacts by the same robot to encourage efficient play rather than random kicking.
        6. `r_robot_fallen` (weight: -15.0): Penalizes the robot if it falls, incentivizing stable movement.

    `info` contains the success parameter if the given episode succeeded.

    ##Episode End
    ### Termination

    The current episode should terminate based on below termination criteria defined as follow:
        1. The ball successfully crosses the goal line between the posts and under the crossbar.
        2. The ball is found in an offside position as determined by the environment’s offside detection logic.
        3. The humanoid agent’s torso height moves outside the allowed range, indicating a fall or collapse.
        4. The physics simulation produces invalid numerical values (e.g., `NaN`), making further computation unreliable.

    ### Truncation
    The default duration of an episode is 5000 timesteps.
