        Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
        
        This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
        
        0. Additional Definitions.
        As used herein, “this License” refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser General Public License, and the “GNU GPL” refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
        
        “The Library” refers to a covered work governed by this License, other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
        
        An “Application” is any work that makes use of an interface provided by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library. Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode of using an interface provided by the Library.
        
        A “Combined Work” is a work produced by combining or linking an Application with the Library. The particular version of the Library with which the Combined Work was made is also called the “Linked Version”.
        
        The “Minimal Corresponding Source” for a Combined Work means the Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
        
        The “Corresponding Application Code” for a Combined Work means the object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
        
        1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
        
        2. Conveying Modified Versions.
        If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified version:
          a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the function or data, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
          b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of this License applicable to that copy.
        
        3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
        The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from a header file that is part of the Library. You may convey such object code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts, and accessors, small macros, and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), you do both of the following:
          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
          b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
        
        4. Combined Works.
        You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that, taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following:
          a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License.
          b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
          d) Do one of the following:
              0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying Corresponding Source.
              1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked Version.
        
        5. Combined Libraries.
        You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side by side in a single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your choice, if you do both of the following:
          a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities, conveyed under the terms of this License.
          b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
        
        6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
        The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
        Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU Lesser General Public License “or any later version” applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that published version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser General Public License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
        
        If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the Library.

## RKD as ROCKETDOO

Odoo Development Framework

**Made with passion, not just programming skills.**

## Developed by:

   - "Horacio Montaño" and "Elias Braceras"

## Version: 
   - "2.2.4"

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Simple Description:

  RKD, also known as ROCKETDOO, is version 2 of the framework designed for assisted and automated deployment of development environments.
   In this version, unlike its predecessor, it no longer depends on a repository. In other words, it is no longer necessary to create a repository from a template — the framework is now fully independent.

   Developers simply need to install the framework on their local machines using either the pip or pipx package managers. The latter is the recommended option, as it allows installing the framework globally on the developer’s system without dealing with Ubuntu and Debian security restrictions that prevent the direct use of pip install.
   To achieve this, we provide the following two installation options:

   > Ensure you have pip installed, or pipx if necessary.

   ``` 
    pip install rocketdoo  --break-system-packages

   ```
   or 

   ``` 
    pipx install rocketdoo

   ```

  - This development environment is intended for those developing on Linux operating systems, such as Ubuntu, Debian, etc. However, for those who prefer to develop on Windows, we suggest installing **WSL2**, the Windows Subsystem for Linux.
  
  - To use this framework, it is essential to have Docker, Docker Compose, and Git installed.

  - ROCKETDOO version 2 now includes its own execution commands, meaning it is no longer necessary to remember or manually use Docker or Docker Compose commands, as the         framework effectively replaces the most essential ones.

  - Starting from this version, there is no need to use the previous repository as a template to build your environment. Simply by installing the framework, you can create your own directories where the Odoo development environment will be applied.

  - In version 2, you can use either the command rocketdoo or its alias rkd for greater convenience and agility.

  - Gitman is used for downloading and installing external repositories.
  
  - Make sure you have **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your computer. If not, you can follow the official Docker installation guide, [Docker Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ### Comand Line

Below we will list the commands that make up the new version of **rocketdoo**

```
 rocketdoo --version

```


```
 rocketdoo --help

```


```
 rocketdoo scaffold

```


```
 rocketdoo init

```


```
 rocketdoo info

```


```
 rocketdoo up

```


```
 rocketdoo up -d

```


```
 rocketdoo status

```


```
 rocketdoo logs

```


```
 rocketdoo stop

```


```
 rocketdoo pause

```


```
 rocketdoo down

```


```
 rocketdoo down -v

```


```
 rocketdoo build

```

```
 rocketdoo deploy

```

  
 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### INSTRUCTIONS:

 1. From your Linux or WSL2 terminal, install the framework using one of the following commands:

 ``` 
    pip install rocketdoo --break-system-packages

   ```
   or 

   ``` 
    pipx install rocketdoo

   ```
   > Make sure you already have pip or pipx installed.
 
 2. Once the framework is installed, navigate to your preferred working directory and create a new directory for your development environment.
 
 3. Inside your development directory, you can start by running the scaffold command.
This command will automatically create all the necessary files and directories required to deploy your Odoo development environment. 
    

 4. Next, you can launch the setup wizard using the init command.
This command will prompt you for all the necessary information to configure your environment.
The questions include:

- Project name

- Odoo version (a list from version 15 to 19 is available for selection)

- Odoo edition (options include Community and Enterprise)

- Whether to use private repositories (for your own developments; it will list your SSH keys connected to your repositories)

- Whether to use third-party repositories (if you answer YES, it will prompt you for the URLs of each repository or repository package)

- PostgreSQL version (selectable option)

- Odoo Master Password (for database creation)

- Container restart policies (selectable option)

- Odoo port (with port validation)

- Visual Studio Code debug port (with port validation)

Port validation checks whether the selected ports are already in use by another instance or service.
If so, it suggests alternative ports or allows you to set them manually
 
 5. Once the setup wizard is completed, you can start the deployment with:

 ```
 rocketdoo up

```
or

```
 rocketdoo up -d

```

or

```
 rkd up -d

```

The -d flag runs the deployment in detached mode.

 6. After the environment has been successfully deployed, you can access Odoo from your preferred web browser using:
 
 - http://localhost:8069 
 
 or the port you selected during setup.

 7. You can check all environment details using:

 ```
 rocketdoo info

```
This command displays detailed information about the current environment in your working directory.

 8. From this point on, you can begin developing with Visual Studio Code by opening the environment’s directory in your editor.

 9. A partir de este momento ya puedes comenzar a desarrollar con Visual Studio Code, abriendo en el editor de codigo, el directorio de este ambiente! 

> Remember that the addons folder is intended for your own developments, but you can also place standalone modules there if needed.

 11. You can also use the available ROCKETDOO commands to stop, pause, remove, or clean up the environment’s containers and volumes, or to view logs.
 
> In this version of ROCKETDOO, you can use either the command rocketdoo or its alias rkd.

 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Suggestions and Considerations:

 - We recommend using Visual Studio Code Extensions, such as **Docker**, **Dev Container**, and any others you find useful for working in VSCode.

 - If you are developing on **Windows** with **WSL2**, it is recommended to use the **WSL:Ubuntu** extension in **Visual Studio Code** for optimal integration and performance.

 - If you wish to develop in the Enterprise edition, Rocketdoo will ask you, and will make the necessary configurations. However, you should ensure that you have the "enterprise" folder with all the modules and place it in the root of this project.

 - This development framework allows you to use private repositories for your developments. For this, the system will ask you if you want to use “private repositories” and if your answer is YES, it will map your local user folder “~/.ssh/” and ask you to choose which ssh key to use. 
Don't worry, these private keys are not saved in your repository after the commit and push; it simply stores them locally and inside the development docker container. 
Remember that your selected key must be previously configured with your GitHub repository.
This private information is as ephemeral as your environment.

### HOW TO ADD MORE MODULES TO GITMAN IF YOU DID NOT DO IT WITH THE LAUNCHER?

  - If you need to use third-party addons after setting up your development environment with our launcher, you’ll need to manually edit the **gitman.yml** file and also add lines to the **odoo.conf** addons_path using:

      ```sudo nano gitman.yml``` 
  
  and complete each line, starting with the repository URL and version, according to your development deployment version. You’ll need to replicate the set of lines to add more third-party repositories.
  
  If you need help, you can refer to the [gitman official guide](https://gitman.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

  - In this example, you can see how to add your new module package paths.
  
  Example:
      ```addons_path: usr/lib/python/dist-packages/odoo/extra_addons/,usr/lib/python/dist-packages/odoo/external_addons/account-financial-tools```
    
  - Gitman creates a folder containing all declared modules under **external_addons**, which can be found inside your Odoo web container at the path declared in **odoo.conf**.

  - All paths should be separated by a comma ","
