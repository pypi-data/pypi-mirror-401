"""Execution module for Station Service SDK.

Contains execution-related components:
- SequenceLoader: Package discovery and loading
- SequenceRegistry: Sequence registration and lookup
- SequenceSimulator: Dry-run simulation
- InteractiveSimulator: Step-by-step debugging
- ManualSequenceExecutor: Manual hardware testing
- DriverRegistry: Hardware driver management
- Validation: Manifest and code validation
