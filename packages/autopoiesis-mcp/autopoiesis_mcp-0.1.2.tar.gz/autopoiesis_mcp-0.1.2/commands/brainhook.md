Toggle the BrainHook "infinite loop mode" enforcement.

When ON, every time you try to stop, you'll be reminded to:
- Look again even if you think you're done
- Check for missed aspects
- Decide whether to fix issues found
- Act on those decisions

This enforces the "LLMs lack global coherence" principle - keep iterating until the user breaks you out.

Current state file: /tmp/brainhook_state.txt

Instructions:
1. Check current state by reading /tmp/brainhook_state.txt (if missing = off)
2. Toggle it: if "on" write "off", if "off" or missing write "on"
3. Report the new state to user

Do this now.
