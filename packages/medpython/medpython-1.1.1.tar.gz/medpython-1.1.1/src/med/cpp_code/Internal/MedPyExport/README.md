# Medial Python Binding

## Relase Notes - 1.1.1
* Bugfix: get_sig when using PidRepository data from json
* Feature: add support to retrieve model arch as json
* Feature: filter MedSamples by bootstrap query language

## Relase Notes - 1.1.0
* **Modularized Package Structure**
    - **Decoupled** `medpython-etl` into a standalone package.
    - `medpython` now acts as a **meta-package**, including `medpython-etl` as a core dependency for user convenience without introducing direct code coupling.
* Enhanced `med.Model` **Functionality**
    - **Runtime Model Updates**: Introduced apply_model_changes to modify models on the fly (e.g., removing explainability or lowering batch counts to save memory) without requiring retraining.
    - **Post-Processor Integration**: Added add_post_processors_json_string_to_model to attach and train new components such as calibrators, explainers, or fairness adjustments onto existing/trained models.
    - **Component Management**: New train/remove/print commands for rep-processors and post-processors, allowing direct execution of training functions for specific model components.
    - **Predictor Export**: Added functionality to retrieve the core predictor in standard scikit-learn or XGBoost formats (for supported predictors)
    - **Architecture Visualization**: Added the ability to retrieve the MedModel architecture in a human-readable, printable format.
    - **Usage Validation**: Implemented strict state checks to prevent logical errors (e.g., ensuring apply cannot be called before the model is trained).
    - **Signal Debugging**: Introduced `debug_rep_processor_signal` to inspect how rep-processors transform raw signals, outlier, etc.
* **Platform & Build Improvements**
    - **macOS Compatibility**: Resolved all compilation issues for **macOS** environments using Conda, ensuring a smoother installation process for Apple Silicon and Intel-based Macs.
