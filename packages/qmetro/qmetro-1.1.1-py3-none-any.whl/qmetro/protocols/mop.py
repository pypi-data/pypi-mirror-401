    """
    Computes the comb QFI using minimization over purifications method
    (MOP) :cite:`dulian2025,kurdzialek2024,Altherr2021`.

    This function computes the QFI of comb consisting of
    ``number_of_channels`` parameter-encoding channels connected with their
    environments.
    
    Notice that ``channel`` may be a single channel or a comb created by
    the user. The resulting QFI is achievable when arbitrary adaptive
    control can be applied in each step. Control may act between channels,
    but also between different teeth of  ``channel``, when ``channel``
    represents a comb.

    Parameters
    ----------
    channel: ParamChannel
        Parametrized channel characterizing signal encoding. Might be a
        single channel or a comb.
    number_of_channels : int
        Number of elementary channels/combs linked to create the full
        comb of interest.
    env_control: bool | tuple[bool, bool], optional
        If True, then adaptive control may also act on first input
        and last output environment. If tuple, then
        its elements refer to input and output environment respectively.
    env_inp_state : np.ndarray | None, optional
        Density matrix of the initial state of the environment. If None
        then it becomes a maximally mixed state. This argument is
        ignored when environment input is controlled.
    input_pure_qfi : float, optional
        The QFI of an additional pure parameter-dependent state.
        This state can be treated as a first tooth of estimated comb.
        By default, there is no such a state (input_pure_qfi = 0).
        Non-zero values are typically used to calculate bounds.
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments passed to the CVXPY ``solve`` method
