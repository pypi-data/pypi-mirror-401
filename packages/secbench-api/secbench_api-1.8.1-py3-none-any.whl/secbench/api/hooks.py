    A Decorator for secbench experiments.

    Decorating running your experiment with ``secbench_main``, has a few advantages:

    - It will automatically create a :py:class:`secbench.core.bench.Bench` and
      pass it as first argument to your function.
    - ``secbench_main`` performs some clean-up and allows to supply
      post-experiment actions, like sending you an e-mail or copying results
      (see the example below).

    :param on_success: An optional hook called if the experiment runs
                       successfully
    :param on_failure: An optional hook called if the experiment failed
    :param exit_on_failure: If true, will invoke sys.exit(1) on error

    :Examples:

    Here is a simple example of using the ``secbench_main`` decorator.

    .. code-block:: python

        from secbench.api.hooks import secbench_main, NotifySendHook

        # A custom hook to copy data into a shared directory. You can do
        # anything there.

        # 'bench' will be passed automatically.
