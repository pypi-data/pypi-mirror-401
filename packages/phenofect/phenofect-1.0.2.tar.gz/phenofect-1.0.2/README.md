# PhenoFECT: Phenology Forecasting and Exploring under ClimaTe change

## What is PhenoFECT?

**PhenoFECT** is an open-source and open meteorological/phenology data (for Korea & Japan) embedded python package designed to guide the overall analysis procedure for **Budding & Flowering Prediction** applicable to user-target plant. It offers useful functions including, Key Parameter Examination of temperature-based model, Clustering, Visualization, Downloading & Merging Phenological and Meteorological Data... and so on. The Chill-Day model (CDM) refined by PhenoFECT showed the highest prediction accuracy for Korean local areas. The root mean square error (RMSE) for the prediction of flowering event decreased about 1–8 days for three temperate zone angiosperms. Under global warming and climate change, the timing of the phenological events of flowering plants is one of the good **climate change indicator**. PhenoFECT can be utilized to predict the phenological event of diverse orchard and tree species and has an advantage of easy-to-use due to the embedded dataset.

## Physiological Background for Plant Phenology

After summer, if the nutrition & weather conditions are satisfied, woody plants prepare next year flowering by differentiation to **flower buds**. But to prevent flower bud differentiate to flowers in cold winter condition because of transient warm temperature, flower buds come into **dormancy state** and their flowering control genes maintain bud statement until they get enough cold requirment. 

![Endo-dormancy (Cherry Blossom)](https://github.com/SongWon03/PhenoFECT/blob/main/Imgs/cherry_endo_dormancy.jpg)

In the Phenology Model, we call the cold requirement as '*Chill-requirement(Cr)*'. If the woody plant get enough cold, dormancy releases. From this time, plant needs Heat to differentiate into flowers. After the heat accumulated same amount to Cr, the Budding event happens. We call that as **Bud burst**. Last, the amount of heat accumulation flower bud differentiate into flower, **flowering**, is called as '*Heat-requirement(Hr)*'.

![Flowering (Cherry Blossom)](https://github.com/SongWon03/PhenoFECT/blob/main/Imgs/cherry_flowering.jpg)

- Dormancy initiation: The Day when minimum temperature reaches to 5-7℃. (Depends on species)
- Dormancy release: The first Day when Chill accumulation is lower than Chill-requirement. 
- Bud burst: Observed Day when 20% of total flower buds in Woody plant get into bud burst.
- Flowering: Observed Day when 3 flowers are observed in a branch. 
- Detailed definition and observation rules are [**guidelines**](https://data.kma.go.kr/data/publication/publicationGlList.do) of KMA(Korea Meteorological Administration).
