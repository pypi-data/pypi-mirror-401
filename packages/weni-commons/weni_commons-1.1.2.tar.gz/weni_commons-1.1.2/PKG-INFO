# Weni Commons

A Python library that centralizes common functionality and utilities used across Weni's Django backend applications.
This library promotes code reuse, consistency, and maintainability by providing shared components and utilities that can be easily integrated into multiple Django projects.

## Installation

### Using Poetry (Recommended for Weni projects)

```bash
poetry add weni-commons
```

### Using pip

```bash
pip install weni-commons
```

## Available Features

### Feature Flags

Weni Feature Flags is a Python Library that functions as an abstraction layer between Django projects and GrowthBook.

```python
from weni.feature_flags.services import FeatureFlagsService

# Use the feature flags service
feature_service = FeatureFlagsService()
```

You can access the complete instructions on how to use its features [here](https://github.com/weni-ai/weni-feature-flags/blob/main/README.md).

## Requirements

- Python >= 3.8
- Django >= 3.2.22
- Django REST Framework >= 3.12.0
- Celery >= 5.0.0
- Redis (via django-redis >= 4.0.0)

## Contributing

This library is designed to grow with Weni's needs. If you have common utilities that could benefit multiple Django projects, consider contributing them to this library.
