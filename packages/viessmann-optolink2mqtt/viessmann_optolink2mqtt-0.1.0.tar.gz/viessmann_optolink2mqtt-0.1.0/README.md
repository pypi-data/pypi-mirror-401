# viessmann-optolink2mqtt

Open source interface between a Viessmann device (heat pump, gas heater, etc) and 
[MQTT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MQTT).

## Architecture

<img title="Setup" alt="Architecture" src="docs/architecture.png">

## Hardware

* A Single Board Computer (SBC) which is capable of running Python and has a USB-A connector
  (if you plan to use the original Viessmann Optolink USB cable)
* The Optolink USB cable to read/write; you have two main options: a) buy the original Viessmann cable on specialized shops such as [https://www.loebbeshop.de/](https://www.loebbeshop.de/); see exact item [here](https://www.loebbeshop.de/viessmann/ersatzteil/anschlussleitung-usb-optolink-fuer-vitoconnetc-artikel-7856059/) or b) build your own cable, more details available from other tinkerers like [MyVitotronicLogger](https://github.com/Ixtalo/MyVitotronicLogger) or at [Optolink splitter readme](https://github.com/philippoo66/optolink-splitter)

## Installation

This project supports 2 main installation methods: PyPi and Docker.
Both methods are meant to be used from a Linux Operating system which has the USB/DIY cable attached
(see "Hardware" section above).

### Pypi package

```sh
python3 -m venv optolink2mqtt-venv
source optolink2mqtt-venv/bin/activate
pip install optolink2mqtt
```

### Docker

Just use:

```sh
docker run -d -v <your config file>:/etc/optolink2mqtt/optolink2mqtt.yaml \
    --hostname $(hostname) \
    --name optolink2mqtt \
    ghcr.io/f18m/optolink2mqtt:latest
```


## Configuration file

This software accepts a declarative configuration in YAML format.
Please look at the [optolink2mqtt.yaml](./optolink2mqtt.yaml) file as reference source for the syntax.

* [Optolink Bridge](https://github.com/kristian/optolink-bridge/): inspired from the "Optolink Splitter"; requires you to own a VitoConnect device and allows you to setup a "man in the middle" device
* [openv vcontrold](https://github.com/openv/vcontrold): seems abandoned but contains a C-based implementation of the VS1 and VS2 protocols apparently. Its [wiki](https://github.com/openv/openv/wiki/) has plenty of details although in German
* [VitoWiFi](https://github.com/bertmelis/VitoWiFi): a C++ implementation of VS1 (KW) and VS2 (P300) Optolink protocols, for use on ESP microcontrollers but also Linux systems
