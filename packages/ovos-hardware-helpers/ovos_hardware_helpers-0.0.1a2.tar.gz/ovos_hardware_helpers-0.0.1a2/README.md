# ovos-hardware-helpers

A small library to help with specific hardware.

Designed to be a drop in replacement for [ovos-plugin-manager/hardware](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-plugin-manager/tree/dev/ovos_plugin_manager/hardware) and upgrades to use the [ovos_color_parser](https://github.com/OpenVoiceOS/ovos-color-parser) module for choosing colors.

Currently it supports LED's, fans, and switches
