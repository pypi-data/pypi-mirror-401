"""
Unified Scope Manager for pythoc

This module provides unified scope management that combines:
- Variable registry (var_registry)
- Defer stack management
- Linear type tracking
- Loop context (break/continue targets)

The key insight is that defer execution time == variable lifetime end.
When a scope exits:
1. Deferred calls for that scope are executed
2. Linear tokens must have been consumed
3. Variables go out of scope

This replaces the separate scope_depth, _defer_stack, and var_registry.enter_scope()/exit_scope()
with a single unified mechanism.
