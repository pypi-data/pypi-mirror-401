"""
defer intrinsic for deferred execution

defer(f, a, b, c) - Register f(a, b, c) to be called when the current block exits

Deferred calls are executed in FIFO order (first registered, first executed)
when the block exits via:
- Normal flow (end of block/scope)
- return (executes all defers from current scope up)
- break/continue (executes defers for loop scope)
- goto (executes defers when jumping out of scope)

Usage:
    @compile
    def example() -> void:
        defer(cleanup, resource)  # Will be called at block exit
        # ... do work ...
        # cleanup(resource) is called here automatically

Note:
- defer captures the arguments at registration time, not at execution time
- Deferred calls are scope-bound: they execute when their scope exits
- Multiple defers in same scope execute in FIFO order (first defer runs first)
- All defer management is done through ScopeManager (no legacy _defer_stack)
