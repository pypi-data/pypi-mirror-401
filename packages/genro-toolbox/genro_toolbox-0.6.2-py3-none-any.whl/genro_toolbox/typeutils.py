"""
Utilities for checking whether an object is an instance of a class
identified only by its full class path (module.ClassName),
without importing the target class.

This avoids circular imports and still behaves like ``isinstance``,
including subclass recognition.

Example:
    safe_is_instance(obj, "mypackage.models.BaseNode")
