You can install Knwl CLI via [pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx):

```
git clone https://github.com/Orbifold/knwl.git
cd knwl
python -m pip install --upgrade pipx
python -m pipx install .
```

It keeps the CLI isolated from system Python packages and uses its own virtual environment.

## Info and Configuration Commands

You can get help and list the available commands by running:

```bash
knwl --help
```

or simply `knwl`.

Via the `info` command, you can get information about your Knwl installation:

```bash
knwl info
```

This will not display configuration details but if you type:

```bash
knwl config tree
```

or more compactly:

```bash
knwl config summary
```

you will get readable information about your Knwl configuration. The information returned is a readable version of the actual JSON configuration used by Knwl. If you really want to see the raw JSON configuration, you can type:

```bash
knwl config get all
```

You can fetch the configuration for specific sections too, e.g.,

```bash
knwl config get llm
```

or more specifically:

```bash
knwl config get llm ollama model
```

Note that this will not work as expected because of the way the configuration is structured:

```bash
knwl config get llm default model
```

## Graph Commands

The `graph` command group allows you to inspect the knowledge graph stored in Knwl. You can list all node and edges types with:

```bash
knwl graph types
```

You can use `knwl graph stats` as well and if you need only node or edge stats you can use `knwl graph types nodes` or `knwl graph types edges`.

To inspect a specific node type, use:

```bash
knwl graph type Person
```

which will return all nodes of type `Person`. You can replace `Person` with any other node type present in your graph.
There is also a count command:

```bash
knwl graph count nodes
```

which will return the total number of nodes in the graph. You can also count edges with:

```bash
knwl graph count edges
```

## Chat Commands

You can ask questions to the knowledge base using the `ask` command:

```bash
knwl ask "Who is Enrico Betti?"
```

If you don't want to use the knowledge graph you can ask the LLM directly with:

```bash
knwl simple "Who is John von Neumann?"
```

or by using the `--simple` flag with the `ask` command:

```bash
knwl ask "Who is John von Neumann?" --simple
```

To extract knowledge without ingesting it into the database, you can use the `extract` command:

```bash
knwl extract "Anna went to school in Johannesburg and married Ian soon thereafter."
```

but if you do want to ingest the knowledge into the graph database, you can use the `ingest` or `add` command:

```bash
knwl add "Anna went to school in Johannesburg and married Ian soon thereafter."
```

You can check the graph was augmented by listing the nodes of type `Person`:

```bash
knwl graph type Person
```

The knowledge is both a graph and a vector store, so 'finding' things can be done via semantic similarity or via property matching. To find nodes similar to given text, you can use:

```bash
knwl graph similar "George Washington"
```

This will return nodes that are semantically similar to "George Washington" along with their similarity scores (or distances).
To find nodes matching specific properties (name and description), you can use:

```bash
knwl graph find "George Washington"
```

This does not return similarity scores but only nodes that match the given text in their properties.
