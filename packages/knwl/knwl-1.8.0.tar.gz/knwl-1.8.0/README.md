**Kwnl** is short for 'knowledge' but could just as well stand for '_know well_'(as in knowing your knowledge well), '_knowledge network workflow library_', '_knwledge notes with linking_', '_keep notes, wiki and links_', '_knwoledge network and wisdom library_' or '_keep notes, write and learn_'.

## Features

- **Five Graph RAG Strategies**: Local, Global, Naive, Self and Hybrid query modes for flexible knowledge retrieval
- **Dependency Injection Framework**: Decorator-based DI system (`@service`, `@singleton_service`, `@inject_config`, `defaults`) for clean, configurable architecture
- **Extensively Tested**: Comprehensive test suite covering all components and strategies
- **No External Services Required**: Runs with lightweight local implementations (Ollama, NetworkX, JSON storage) out of the box. Great for experiments while fully open for enterprise-grade integrations with Qdrant, Neo4j, LangGraph, etc.
- **Protocol-Based & Extensible**: Override base classes and configure via JSON to customize LLMs, storage, chunking, extraction, and more
- **Semantic Search**: Vector-based similarity search for nodes, edges, and chunks
- **Classic RAG**: includes traditional retrieval-augmented generation with chunk-based context
- **Rich Output Formatting**: Beautiful terminal, HTML, and Markdown renderers for all models using Rich and custom formatters.
- **Graph Visualization**: the default graph store is saved as GraphML which can be visualized with tools like Gephi, yEd or Cytoscape. Equally open to graph databases and advanced graph visualization (Bloom, yFiles, Ogma, etc.)
- **Any LLM**: Easily swap LLM implementations (Ollama, OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.) via configuration.

## Architecture

KNWL uses a hierarchical configuration system with service variants, allowing runtime component swapping without code changes. All components inherit from `FrameworkBase` and are wired through dependency injection.

Core services include:

- **LLM**: Ollama, OpenAI (configurable via `llm.default`)
- **Storage**: JSON, Chroma, NetworkX, Memgraph storage
- **Chunking**: Tiktoken-based text splitting
- **Extraction**: Graph and entity extraction with customizable prompts
- **Vector Search**: Semantic similarity for retrieval

## Graph RAG Strategies

KNWL implements five distinct retrieval strategies for different query patterns:

### Local Strategy

Focuses on entity-centric retrieval:

- Extracts **low-level keywords** from the query and matches against nodes (primary nodes)
- Retrieves the **relationship neighborhood** around these primary nodes
- Builds context from:
  - Primary node records (name, type, description)
  - Connected relationship records (source, target, type, description)
  - Text chunks associated with the primary nodes

**Use case**: Questions about specific entities or concepts and their immediate relationships.

### Global Strategy

Focuses on relationship-centric retrieval:

- Extracts **high-level keywords** from the query and matches against edges
- Retrieves the **node endpoints** of matching edges
- Builds context from:
  - Node endpoint records (entities connected by the relationships)
  - Edge records (source, target, type, description)
  - Text chunks associated with the edges

**Use case**: Questions about relationships, connections, or patterns between entities.

### Naive Strategy

Traditional RAG approach:

- Performs direct **semantic similarity search** on text chunks
- No graph structure utilized
- Builds context purely from retrieved chunks

**Use case**: Simple fact-finding or when graph structure isn't beneficial.

### Hybrid Strategy

Combines Local and Global strategies:

- Executes both local and global retrieval in parallel
- Merges and deduplicates the combined context
- Provides comprehensive coverage across entities, relationships, and chunks

**Use case**: Complex queries benefiting from both entity and relationship context.

### Self Strategy

Like naive RAG, this is an auxiliary strategy. It asks the LLM to generate context on its own without retrieval. This is useful for:

- Baseline comparisons
- Scenarios where no relevant context exists in the graph
- Fallback when other strategies yield no results.

## Quick Start

Knwl is a flexible package with many services and articulations. You typically would not use the quick start below for a real-world scenario but we have included the `Knwl` class as a wrapper around some functionality to demonstrate how you can get started without any setup or config.

You can use Kwnl with Poetry, pip and [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Out of the box Knwl will use Ollama as LLM, NetworkX as graph store and JSON files for persistence.
So, if you want to run the snippet below, make sure you have [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) running locally with a model like `qwen2.5:7b` downloaded (`ollama pull qwen2.5:7b`).

Install Knwl:

```bash
uv add knwl
```

Paste the following code in a Python file (say, `go.py`) and run it (`uv run go.py`):

```python
from knwl import Knwl, print_knwl


async def main():
    knwl = Knwl()

    # add a fact
    await knwl.add_fact("gravity", "Gravity is a universal force that attracts two bodies toward each other.", id="fact1", )

    assert (await knwl.node_exists("fact1")) is True

    # add another fact
    await knwl.add_fact("photosynthesis", "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants and some other organisms use sunlight to synthesize foods from carbon dioxide and water.", id="fact2", )
    # at least two nodes should be present now
    assert await knwl.node_count() >= 2

    # you can take the node returned from add_fact as an alternative
    found = await knwl.get_nodes_by_name("gravity")
    assert len(found) >= 1
    gravity_node = found[0]
    found = await knwl.get_nodes_by_name("photosynthesis")
    assert len(found) >= 1
    photosynthesis_node = found[0]
    # connect the two nodes
    await knwl.connect(source_name=gravity_node.name, target_name=photosynthesis_node.name, relation="Both are fundamental natural processes.", )

    # one edge
    assert await knwl.edge_count() >= 1

    # Augmentation will fetch the gravity node, despite that it does not directly relate to photosynthesis
    # Obviously, this 1-hop result would not happen with classic RAG since the vector similarity is too low
    augmentation = await knwl.augment("What is photosynthesis?")
    # pretty print the augmentation result
    print_knwl(augmentation)

    # graph RAG question-answer
    a = await knwl.ask("What is photosynthesis?")
    print_knwl(a.answer)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio

    asyncio.run(main())

```

This will output the ingestion

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img style="border: 1px solid #ccc; border-radius: 4px; padding: 4px; margin: auto; width: 100%;" src="https://discovery.graphsandnetworks.com/images/knwl/Photosynthesis.png" alt="Quick-start ingestion results.">
</div>

and the answer to the question about photosynthesis, augmented with graph context.

You can find the LLM cache, the graph (GraphML) and the JSON storage files in the working directory (`~/.knwl/default`). You can define multiple data namespaces and switch between them via configuration (`Knwl(namespace=...)`).

**Note**: ChromaDB is used for vector similarity and out of the box uses `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` as embedding model. The model will be downloaded automatically on first run.

Out of the box, Kwnl uses Ollama with Qwen2.5:7b as LLM. You can see this in the `config.py` file where you will find:

```json
    "llm": {
        "default": "ollama",
        "ollama": {
            "class": "knwl.llm.ollama.OllamaClient",
            "model": "qwen2.5:7b",
            "caching_service": "@/llm_caching/user",
            "temperature": 0.1,
            "context_window": 32768,
        }
    }
```

You can see adjacent to this section for Anthropic, OpenAI and other LLM configurations. You can swap out the default LLM by changing the `default` parameter to another variant name, e.g. `openai`. Obviously, if you use Ollama or similar you need to download the model first.


## Dev Installation

To install Knwl for development, clone the repository and install the dependencies using UV:

```bash
mkdir knwl-dev
cd knwl-dev
git clone https://github.com/Orbifold/knwl.git
mkdir experiments
cd experiments
uv init
uv add --editable ../knwl
```

## Formatting & Rendering

KNWL provides sophisticated formatting utilities for beautiful output across multiple mediums: **terminal**, **HTML**, and **Markdown**. The formatting system is protocol-based and extensible, allowing custom formatters for any Pydantic model.

### Terminal Output with Rich

The Rich-based terminal formatter creates beautiful, colorful console output with tables, panels, and trees:

```python
from knwl.format import print_knwl, format_knwl
from knwl.models import KnwlNode, KnwlEdge, KnwlGraph

# Print models directly to terminal with beautiful formatting
node = KnwlNode(name="AI", type="Concept", description="Artificial Intelligence")
print_knwl(node)  # Renders as formatted panel with table

# Format collections
edges = [KnwlEdge(...), KnwlEdge(...)]
print_knwl(edges)  # Renders as organized table with syntax highlighting

# Get formatted object for further manipulation
formatted = format_knwl(node, format_type="terminal")
```

**Features:**

- Consistent color schemes and styling across all models
- Automatic table generation for model fields
- Syntax highlighting for code and JSON
- Tree views for hierarchical data
- Customizable themes via `RichTheme`

### HTML Output

Generate semantic HTML with CSS classes for web displays, documentation, and reports:

```python
from knwl.format import render_knwl, format_knwl

# Get HTML string
html = format_knwl(node, format_type="html")

# Save to file with full page structure
render_knwl(graph, format_type="html", output_file="output.html", full_page=True, title="Knowledge Graph")
```

**Features:**

- Semantic HTML5 with CSS classes (`knwl-panel`, `knwl-table`, etc.)
- Customizable class mappings
- Full page generation with proper HTML structure
- Responsive tables and layouts

### Markdown Output

Create GitHub-flavored Markdown for documentation and static sites:

```python
# Generate markdown
md = format_knwl(graph, format_type="markdown")

# Save with frontmatter
render_knwl(result, format_type="markdown", output_file="report.md", add_frontmatter=True, title="Query Results")
```

**Features:**

- GitHub-flavored Markdown tables
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Frontmatter support for static site generators
- Hierarchical headings for nested structures

### Custom Formatters

Register custom formatters for your own models:

```python
from knwl.format import register_formatter
from knwl.format.formatter_base import ModelFormatter


@register_formatter(MyCustomModel, "terminal")
class MyCustomFormatter(ModelFormatter):
    def format(self, model, formatter, **options):
        # Access Rich formatter's theming
        table = formatter.create_table(title="My Custom Output")
        # Add custom formatting logic
        return formatter.create_panel(table, title=model.name)
```

All KNWL models (`KnwlNode`, `KnwlEdge`, `KnwlGraph`, `KnwlAnswer`, `KnwlContext`, etc.) have pre-registered formatters for consistent output across formats.

## Dependency Injection

Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern that allows a class or function to receive its dependencies from an external source rather than creating them itself. This promotes loose coupling and enhances testability and maintainability of code.

## Injecting Configuration

Knwl has a default configuration allowing you to run things out of the box. For example, the default LLM is set to use Ollama with Qwen 2.5.

There are two ways to tune the configuration:

- all DI methods have an `override` parameter that allows you to pass a configuration dictionary that will override the default configuration for that specific function or class. Override here means actually 'deep merge' so you only need to specify the parts you want to change.
- you can modify the `knwl.config.default_config` dictionary directly to change the default configuration for the entire application. You can see an example of this below.

### Injecting Services

A simple example illustrate how it works and at the same time shows that the DI framework in Knwl can be used independently:

```python
from knwl.di import service

class Pizza:
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self._size = kwargs.get("size", "medium")
        self._price = kwargs.get("price", 10.00)
        self._name = kwargs.get("name", "pizza")

    def size(self):
        return self._size

    def price(self):
        return self._price

    def name(self):
        return self._name

sett = {
    "food": {
        "default":"pizza",
        "pizza": {
            "class": "__main__.Pizza",
            "size": "large",
            "price": 13.99,
            "name": "pizza",
        }
    }
}

@service("food", override=sett, param_name="kitchen")
def prepare(kitchen=None):
    if kitchen is None:
        raise ValueError("Kitchen service not injected")
    return f"Prepared a {kitchen.size()} {kitchen.name()} costing ${kitchen.price()}"


print(prepare()) # Output: Prepared a large pizza costing $13.99

```

A service `food` is defined in a configuration dictionary and the default food service is set to `pizza`. The `Pizza` class is a simple class with a method `price` that returns the price of the pizza.

The `prepare` function is decorated with the `@service` decorator, which injects the `kitchen` parameter with an instance of the `Pizza` class based on the configuration provided in `sett`. When `prepare()` is called, it uses the injected `kitchen` service to get the size and price of the pizza.
The configuration also defines a couple of named parameters that are passed to the `Pizza` constructor when the service is instantiated. This allows one to completely change the behavior of the `prepare` function by simply changing the configuration, without modifying the function itself.

Adding Chinese food would be as simple as:

```python

class Chinese:
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        self._size = kwargs.get("size", "medium")
        self._price = kwargs.get("price", 7.00)
        self._name = kwargs.get("name", "chinese food")

    def size(self):
        return self._size

    def price(self):
        return self._price

    def name(self):
        return self._name
sett = {
    "food": {
        "default":"chinese",
        "pizza": {
            "class": "__main__.Pizza",
            "size": "large",
            "price": 13.99,
            "name": "pizza",
        },
        "chinese": {
            "class": "__main__.Chinese",
            "size": "small",
            "price": 8.99,
            "name": "noodles",
        },
    }
}
```

### Injecting Singleton Services

Note that DI does not force you to create instances via configuration. You can still create instances directly and pass them to functions if you prefer. DI simply provides a flexible way to manage dependencies when needed.

The above example will inject a new instance every time `prepare` is called. If you want to use a singleton instance instead, you can use the `@singleton_service` decorator:

```python
@singleton_service("food", override=sett, param_name="a")
@singleton_service("food", override=sett, param_name="b")
def prepare(a=None, b=None):
    assert a is b, "Singleton instances are not the same!"
    return a

food1 = prepare()
food2 = prepare()
assert food1 is food2, "Singleton instances are not the same!"
```

The magic happens via the DI framework `container` which keeps track of all services and their instances.

### Ad-hoc Classes and Functions

You can define ad-hoc classes, functions, or even instances directly in the configuration:

```python
from knwl.di import service, singleton_service


class Car:
    def __init__(self, make="Toyota", model="Corolla"):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Car(make={self.make}, model={self.model})"


sett = {
    "vehicle": {
        "default": "car",
        "car": {
            "class": Car,
            "make": "Honda",
            "model": "Civic"
        }
    }
}

@service("vehicle", override=sett)
def get_vehicle(vehicle=None):
    if vehicle:
        print(str(vehicle))

get_vehicle() # Output: Car(make=Honda, model=Civic)
```

With a lambda function:

```python
from knwl.di import service, singleton_service


class Car:
    def __init__(self, make="Toyota", model="Corolla"):
        self.make = make
        self.model = model

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Car(make={self.make}, model={self.model})"


sett = {
    "vehicle": {
        "default": "car",
        "car": {
            "class": Car,
            "make": "Honda",
            "model": "Civic"
        }
    }
}

@service("vehicle", override=sett)
def get_vehicle(vehicle=None):
    if vehicle:
        print(str(vehicle))

get_vehicle() # Output: Car(make=Toyota, model=Corolla)
```

### Cascading Dependencies

Services can depend on other services. The DI framework will resolve these dependencies automatically:

```python
from knwl.di import service, singleton_service

sett = {
    "vehicle": {
        "default": "car",
        "car": {"class": "__main__.Car", "make": "Honda", "model": "Civic"},
    },
    "engine": {
        "default": "v6",
        "v6": {"class": "__main__.Engine", "horsepower": 300},
        "v4": {"class": "__main__.Engine", "horsepower": 150},
    },
}


class Engine:
    def __init__(self, horsepower=150):
        self.horsepower = horsepower

    def __repr__(self):
        return str(self.horsepower)


@service("engine", override=sett)
class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine=None):
        self._engine = engine

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Car(engine={self._engine})"



@service("vehicle", override=sett)
def get_vehicle(vehicle=None):
    if vehicle:
        print(str(vehicle))


get_vehicle()
# Output: Car(engine=300)
```

### Injecting Configuration Values

The DI framework can inject configuration values, not just services. This is useful for injecting settings or parameters into functions or classes:

```python
from knwl.di import service, singleton_service, inject_config

sett = {
    "not_found": {
        "short": "Sorry, I can't help with that.",
        "long": "I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for.",
    }
}
@inject_config("not_found.long", override=sett, param_name="not_found")
def ask(not_found):
    return not_found

print(ask())  # Output: I'm sorry, but I don't have the information you're looking for.
```

### Default Configuration

In all the examples above, we passed an `override` parameter to the decorators to provide configuration. In a real application, you would typically load configuration from a file or environment variables and set it in the DI container at application startup:

```python
from knwl.di import inject_config
from knwl.config import default_config
default_config["a"] = {"b": "I'm a.b"}

@inject_config("a.b",  param_name="who")
def ask(who):
    return who

print(ask())  # Output: I'm a.b
```

You can also completely replace the `default_config` dictionary if needed.

### Direct Access to Services

The DI container makes use of dynamic instantiation which you can also use directly if needed:

```python
import asyncio
from knwl import services

async def main():
	s = services.get_service("llm")
	result = await s.ask("What is the Baxter equation?")
	print(result.answer)

asyncio.run(main())
```

The `get_service` looks up the `llm` service configuration and if not variation is found, the default one will be used. In this case it will use the `OllamaClient`.

A variation is simply a named configuration under the service. For example, if you had a configuration like this:

```python
sett = {
    "llm": {
        "default": "gemma",
        "gemma": {
            "class": "knwl.services.llm.ollama.OllamaClient",
            "model": "gemma3:7b"
        },
        "qwen": {
            "class": "knwl.services.llm.ollama.OllamaClient",
            "model": "Qwen2.5-7B"
        }
    }
}
```

you could use `services.get_service("llm", variation="qwen")` to get an instance of the `OllamaClient` configured to use the `Qwen2.5-7B` model instead of the default `gemma3:7b`.
This allows you to easily switch between different implementations or configurations of a service at runtime without changing the code that uses the service.

Much like the injection decorators, you can also pass an `override` parameter to `get_service` to provide ad-hoc configuration for that specific instance. You can also use `get_singleton_service` to get a singleton instance of a service. Whether you use a service via injection or directly via `get_service`, the same instance will be returned if it's a singleton service. The DI container relies on the `services` for singletons and instantiation.

### Config Redirecting

Service injection happens if the parameter is not provided. If you instantiate a class in the normal Python way:

```python
engine = Engine(horsepower=110)
car = Car(engine=engine)
print(car)  # Car(engine=110)
```

the DI is still active beyond the screen but nothing will be injected since the parameter is already provided. It supplies defaults only.

There are situations where the constructor parameter is another services and you want to use a specific variation of that service. You can do this by using a special syntax in the configuration: `@/service_name/variant_name`. For example, if you have a `Car` class that depends on an `Engine` service, and you want to use a specific variant of the `Engine` service when creating a `Car`, you can do it like this:

```python
import asyncio
from knwl import  services, service


config = {
    "engine":{
        "default":"e240",
       "e240":{
            "class": "__main__.Engine",
            "horsepower": 240
       },
       "e690":{
            "class": "__main__.Engine",
            "horsepower": 690
       }
    },
    "car":{
        "default":"car1",
        "car1":{
            "class": "__main__.Car",
            "engine": "@/engine/e690"
        },
        "car2":{
            "class": "__main__.Car",
            "engine": "@/engine/e240"
        }
    }
}

class Engine:

    def __init__(self, horsepower=150):
        self.horsepower = horsepower

    def __repr__(self):
        return str(self.horsepower)


@service("engine", override=config)
class Car:
    def __init__(self, engine=None):
        self._engine = engine

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Car(engine={self._engine})"


async def main():
   car = services.get_service("car", override=config)
   print(car)  # Car(engine=690)


asyncio.run(main())
```

The important bit to note here is that the output is `Car(engine=690)` even though the default engine is `e240`. This is because the `car1` configuration specifies that the `engine` parameter should be injected with the `e690` variant of the `Engine` service using the special syntax `@/engine/e690`. This allows you to control which variant of a dependent service is used when instantiating a service, providing fine-grained control over service dependencies via configuration.
If you leave out the `engine` parameter in the `car1` configuration, the default `e240` engine would be used instead.

Specifically in the context of Knwl, this allows you to define LLM instances for different actions: you can define a different LLM for summarization, another for question answering, and so on, all configurable via the configuration dictionary without changing the code. This is not just theoretical, a small LLM (say, 4b parameters) is convenient for summarization but you might want to use a larger model for more complex tasks like entity extraction. If you try gemma3:4b for entity extraction you will find that it times out while a larger model like Qwen2.5-7b works fine. Of course, if would be great to use one model to do everything but exxperience shows that every model has its strengths and weaknesses and using the right one for the job is often the best approach.

### Injecting Defaults with @defaults

The `@defaults` decorator provides a convenient way to inject default values from service configurations directly into class constructors or functions. This is particularly useful when you want all the parameters from a service configuration to be automatically injected without manually specifying each one. The `@defaults` decorator reads the configuration for the specified service and injects all matching parameters into the decorated function or class constructor. It replaces the standard way of assigning default values in the constructor with automatic injection from configuration.

While `@service` is great for injecting a single service instance, `@defaults` shines when you have a service configuration with multiple parameters that you want to inject as defaults. It reads the configuration for the specified service and injects all matching parameters into the decorated function or class constructor.

#### Basic Usage

The following complete example illustrates how `@defaults` works:

```python
import asyncio
from knwl import defaults
from faker import Faker

config = {
    "generator": {
        "default": "small",
        "small": {"class": "__main__.Generator", "max_length": 50},
        "large": {"class": "__main__.Generator", "max_length": 200},
    },
    "llm": {
        "default": "my",
        "my": {"class": "__main__.MyLLM", "generator": "@/generator/large"},
    },
}

class Generator:
    def __init__(self, max_length=50):
        self.faker = Faker()
        self.max_length = max_length

    def generate(self, input):
        return self.faker.text(max_nb_chars=self.max_length)

@defaults("llm", override=config)
class MyLLM:
    def __init__(self, generator=None):
        if generator is None:
            raise ValueError("MyLLM: Generator instance must be provided.")
        if not isinstance(generator, Generator):
            raise TypeError("MyLLM: generator must be an instance of Generator.")
        self.generator = generator

    def ask(self, question):
        return f"Answer ({self.generator.max_length}): '{self.generator.generate(question)}'"
async def main():
    llm = MyLLM()
    print(llm.ask("What is a quandl?"))


asyncio.run(main())
```

In this example:

1. The decorator reads the default variant ("basic") from the `llm` configuration
2. It retrieves all parameters from `llm.my` (the default variant)
3. For the `generator` parameter, it sees the `@/generator/large` reference
4. It instantiates the large variant of the generator service and injects it.

By changing `{"class": "__main__.MyLLM", "generator": "@/generator/large"}` to `{"class": "__main__.MyLLM", "generator": "@/generator/small"}` in the config, the `MyLLM` instance would instead receive a small generator with `max_length=50`.

#### Specifying a Variant

You can specify a particular variant instead of using the default:

```python
@defaults("llm", variant="ollama")
class CustomLLMProcessor:
    def __init__(self, model=None, temperature=None, context_window=None):
        # All parameters from llm.ollama config are injected:
        # model="qwen2.5:14b", temperature=0.1, context_window=32768
        self.model = model
        self.temperature = temperature
        self.context_window = context_window
```

#### Ad-hoc Instances

Channging providers and settings is, hence, a matter of changing the configuration, not the code. It's also easy to define custom implementations and plugging them into the system via configuration.

In the example below, a `StaticGenerator` is defined that always returns the same text. This is useful for testing or specific use cases where you want predictable output. The instance is created directly in the configuration and injected as-is into the `MyLLM` class.

```python
import asyncio
from knwl import defaults
from faker import Faker


class Generator:
    def __init__(self, max_length=50):
        self.faker = Faker()
        self.max_length = max_length

    def generate(self, input):
        return self.faker.text(max_nb_chars=self.max_length)


class StaticGenerator(Generator):
    def __init__(self, text="Hello, World!"):
        self.text = text
        self.max_length = len(text)

    def generate(self, input):
        return self.text


config = {
    "generator": {
        "default": "small",
        "small": {"class": "__main__.Generator", "max_length": 50},
        "large": {"class": "__main__.Generator", "max_length": 200},
    },
    "llm": {
        "default": "my",
        "my": {
            "class": "__main__.MyLLM",
            "generator": StaticGenerator(),  # Direct instance
        },
    },
}


@defaults("llm", override=config)
class MyLLM:
    def __init__(self, generator=None):
        if generator is None:
            raise ValueError("MyLLM: Generator instance must be provided.")
        if not isinstance(generator, Generator):
            raise TypeError("MyLLM: generator must be an instance of Generator.")
        self.generator = generator

    def ask(self, question):
        return f"Answer ({self.generator.max_length}): '{self.generator.generate(question)}'"


async def main():
    llm = MyLLM()
    print(llm.ask("What is a quandl?"))


asyncio.run(main())

```

#### Service Reference Resolution

The `@defaults` decorator automatically handles service redirection (strings starting with `@/`):

```python
# Config:
# "graph_extraction": {
#     "default": "basic",
#     "basic": {
#         "class": "knwl.extraction.BasicGraphExtraction",
#         "mode": "full",
#         "llm": "@/llm/ollama"  # Service reference
#     }
# }

@defaults("graph_extraction")
class BasicGraphExtraction:
    def __init__(self, llm=None, mode=None):
        # llm is instantiated from the llm/ollama service
        # mode is injected as the string value "full"
        self.llm = llm
        self.mode = mode
```

This allows you to reuse configurations across different services and ensures that the correct instances are injected based on the configuration.

#### Parameter Filtering

The decorator _only_ injects parameters that exist in the function/constructor signature. Config values that don't match parameter names are silently ignored:

```python
# Config has: model, temperature, context_window, caching
@defaults("llm")
class SimpleProcessor:
    def __init__(self, model=None, temperature=None):
        # Only model and temperature are injected
        # caching and context_window are ignored (not in signature)
        self.model = model
        self.temperature = temperature
```

This ensures that you can define all sorts of things in the configuration without worrying that the constructor or function will break because of unexpected parameters.

#### Overriding Defaults

You can still override the injected defaults when creating instances:

```python
@defaults("entity_extraction")
class FlexibleExtraction:
    def __init__(self, llm=None, custom_param="default"):
        self.llm = llm
        self.custom_param = custom_param

# Use injected defaults
extractor1 = FlexibleExtraction()

# Override the LLM
from knwl.services import services
custom_llm = services.get_service("llm", variant_name="ollama")
extractor2 = FlexibleExtraction(llm=custom_llm)

# Override a custom parameter
extractor3 = FlexibleExtraction(custom_param="custom_value")
```

#### Combining with Other Decorators

The `@defaults` decorator can be combined with other DI decorators like `@inject_config`:

```python
@defaults("graph_extraction")
@inject_config("api.host", "api.port")
class AdvancedGraphExtraction:
    def __init__(self, llm=None, mode=None, host=None, port=None):
        # llm and mode injected from graph_extraction config
        # host and port injected from api config
        self.llm = llm
        self.mode = mode
        self.host = host
        self.port = port
```

When multiple decorators are used, they are applied in order from bottom to top (this is the Python default behavior). Each decorator adds its own injections, and explicitly provided arguments always take precedence.

#### Using with Override

Like other DI decorators, `@defaults` supports runtime configuration overrides:

```python
custom_config = {
    "entity_extraction": {
        "basic": {
            "llm": "@/llm/gemma_small"  # Override to use different LLM
        }
    }
}

@defaults("entity_extraction", override=custom_config)
class TestExtraction:
    def __init__(self, llm=None):
        self.llm = llm
```

## Configuration

Knwl has an intricate [[DependencyInjection]] system which allows for flexible configuration of its services. Instead of having defaults for the constructor parameters of each service, Knwl uses a centralized configuration object to manage dependencies. This design choice enables easier testing, customization, and extension of the services without modifying their internal implementations.

For example, the default chunking is based on Tiktoken and happens in the `TiktokenChunkin` class. There are essentially three parameters that can be configured for chunking:

- the chunk size
- the chunk overlap
- the chunking model

In the `config.py` file you will find:

```json
{
  "chunking": {
    "default": "tiktoken",
    "tiktoken": {
      "class": "knwl.chunking.TiktokenChunking",
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "chunk_size": 1024,
      "chunk_overlap": 128
    }
  }
}
```

You can moddigy these paramters to change the default chunking behavior of Knwl.

Alternatively you can override the config when instantiating the chunking service:

```python
from knwl.services import services
chunker = services.get_service("chunking", override={
    "chunking"{
        "tiktoken": {
            "chunk_size": 2048,
            "chunk_overlap": 256,
        }
    }
})
```

This overrides the default chunking configuration but you can also defines variations (variants) like so:

```json
{
  "chunking": {
    "default": "tiktoken",
    "tiktoken": {
      "class": "knwl.chunking.TiktokenChunking",
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "chunk_size": 1024,
      "chunk_overlap": 128
    },
    "tiktoken-large": {
      "class": "knwl.chunking.TiktokenChunking",
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "chunk_size": 2048,
      "chunk_overlap": 256
  }
}
```

Then you can instantiate the chunking service with the "tiktoken-large" variant:

```python
from knwl.services import services
chunker = services.get_service("chunking", "tiktoken-large")
```

If you have lots of configurations to override, you can also replace the active or base configuration entirely using the `set_active_config` function from `knwl.config`:

```python
from knwl.config import set_active_config
new_config = {
  "chunking": {
    "default": "tiktoken-large",
    "tiktoken": {
      "class": "knwl.chunking.TiktokenChunking",
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "chunk_size": 1024,
      "chunk_overlap": 128
    },
    "tiktoken-large": {
      "class": "knwl.chunking.TiktokenChunking",
      "model": "gpt-4o-mini",
      "chunk_size": 2048,
      "chunk_overlap": 256
    }
  }
}
set_active_config(new_config)
```

If you want this configuration to be the default for all chunking services, you can change the "default" key in the config to point to "tiktoken-large":

```json
{
  "chunking": {
    "default": "tiktoken-large",
    ...
  }
}
```

### Redirecting

The inter-dependency of services means that a service configuration is required in multiple place. You can re-use or redirect a configuration by using the `@/` prefix. For example, if you want to use the same chunking configuration for a different service, you can do:

```json
{
  "some_other_service": {
    "chunking": "@/chunking/tiktoken"
  }
}
```

More concretely, you will see that the default graph RAG service is configured like so:

```json
{
  "graph_rag": {
    "default": "local",
    "local": {
      "class": "knwl.semantic.graph_rag.graph_rag.GraphRAG",
      "semantic_graph": "@/semantic_graph/memory",
      "ragger": "@/rag_store",
      "graph_extractor": "@/graph_extraction/basic",
      "keywords_extractor": "@/keywords_extraction"
    }
  }
}
```

The syntax `@/semantic_graph/memory` tells Knwl to use the configuration defined for the `memory` variant of the `semantic_graph` service. This allows for consistent configuration across different services without duplication.
If there is no variant specified, Knwl will use the default variant for that service. The `@/rag_store` in the example above will resolve to the default variant of the `rag_store` service.

### Print

The `print_knwl` function is a generic printing utility for various Knwl objects. It also allows to print configuration details of services. For example, to print the configuration of the chunking service, you can do:

```python
from knwl import print_knwl
print_knwl("@/chunking")
```

or the default Ollama model:

```python
print_knwl("@/llm/ollama/model")
```

The configuration can contains redirections but the print will resolve them for clarity.

There are special paths in Knwl that can be used to reference different directories. These paths are prefixed with `$` and are resolved to specific locations in the file system. The special paths include:

- `$/data`: This path points to the `data` directory within the Knwl project. It is typically used to store datasets or other data files required by Knwl.
- `$/root`: This path points to the root directory of the Knwl project. It can be used to reference files or directories located at the top level of the Knwl project.
- `$/user`: This path points to a user-specific directory, typically located in the user's home directory. It is used to store user-specific configurations or data related to Knwl.
- `$/tests`: This path points to the `tests/data` directory within the Knwl project. It is used to store test datasets or files required for testing Knwl functionalities.
  These special paths can be used in configuration files or code to easily reference important directories without hardcoding absolute paths. The Knwl utility functions will resolve these paths to their actual locations when needed.

You can test the special paths using the `print_knwl` function like so:

```python
print_knwl("$/user/abc")
print_knwl("$/data/xyz")
print_knwl("$/tests/xyz")
```

## Testing

Knwl is extensively tested with unit tests covering all components, strategies, and integration scenarios. The tests depending on an LLM require various Ollama models, Anthropic, OpenAI and more.

You can run the tests without LLM integration (fast) via:

```bash
uv run pytest -m "not llm"
```

## Examples

In the `examples/` directory, you can find various scripts demonstrating KNWL's capabilities, including:

- Basic usage and querying
- Custom LLM integration
- Advanced configuration scenarios

Use VSCode Interactive Python for best experience but you can also run this script directly.
See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py for more details.

## Model Evaluation and Benchmarks

In the `benchmarks` directory, you can find evaluation scripts and benchmark datasets to assess Knwl's performance across different graph RAG strategies and configurations. These benchmarks help in understanding the effectiveness of various retrieval methods and the overall system efficiency. Main insights include:

- bigger models take longer to ingest data and do not perform better
- reasoning models do not improved graph extraction quality.

## Known Issues

- The error `PanicException: range start index 10 out of range for slice ...` from ChromaDB happens when the underlying collection is corrupted. The workaround is to delete the collection and re-create it. Go to the Kwnl data directory (usually `~/.knwl/default/`) and delete the `vector` or any other ChromaDB subdirectory.
