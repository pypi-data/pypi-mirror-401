    Base class for semantic graph implementations.

    Graph store is just a storage backend for nodes and edges.

    - similarity search via embeddings

    You can do embeddings in various graph stores (e.g. Neo4j, TigerGraph, etc.) but the augmentation of description is something you do not have in those graph stores.
