For text formatting and colorization in the terminal.

A Python module to add ANSI color and format codes to strings for terminal output.


# Installation

Upgrade pip first (optional but recommended):
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip
# or (more explicit)
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

Install from PyPI:
```bash
pip install eRCaGuy_PyColors
```

Or install from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElectricRCAircraftGuy/eRCaGuy_PyColors.git
cd eRCaGuy_PyColors
pip install .
```

For development (editable install):
```bash
pip install -e .
```

To install into a virtual environment:
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv ~/venvs/eRCaGuy_PyColors
. ~/venvs/eRCaGuy_PyColors/bin/activate

# To see if you're in a virtual environment, run:
echo "$VIRTUAL_ENV"
# If in a virtual environment, this will print the path to the virtual environment.
# Otherwise, it will print nothing.

# Now install as above. Ex: 
# Option 1: install from PyPI:
pip install eRCaGuy_PyColors
# Option 2: install from source: 
# - Inside of the `eRCaGuy_PyColors` repo: 
pip install .
```


# Example usage in your Python program

```python
# Recommended import style
import eRCaGuy_PyColors as colors
# OR (older style): 
# import eRCaGuy_PyColors.ansi_colors as colors

print(f"{colors.FGR}This text is green.{colors.END}")
print(f"{colors.FBB}This text is bright blue.{colors.END}")
print(f"{colors.FBR}This text is bright red.{colors.END}")

colors.print_green("This text is green.")
colors.print_blue("This text is bright blue.")
colors.print_red("This text is bright red.")
colors.print_yellow("This text is bright yellow.")
```


# Test and run this program

Run the built-in tests:
```bash
python3 -m eRCaGuy_PyColors
```

Example run and output:

# Publishing to PyPI

See: 
1. https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/
1. https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/writing-pyproject-toml/

For maintainers, to publish a new version to PyPI:

#### Short version
```bash
./deploy.sh
```

#### Details
1. Install or upgrade `twine`: 
    ```bash
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade twine build
    ```
1. Update the version number in `eRCaGuy_PyColors/__init__.py`.  
    
    NB: no new changes will be deployed to PyPI if the version number in `eRCaGuy_PyColors/__init__.py` has not been changed since the last upload.
1. Clean the old build
    ```bash
    rm -rf dist/ build/ *.egg-info
    ```
1. Build the distribution packages according to the settings in `pyproject.toml`:
    ```bash
    time python3 -m build
    ```
1. Obtain a PyPI API token: 
    1. Log into your PyPI account.
    1. Go to https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens, setting the “Scope” to “Entire account”. Don’t close the page until you have copied and saved the token — you won’t see that token again.
1. Test an upload to TestPyPI first (recommended):
    1. Obtain an API token at https://test.pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens --> "Add API token" --> (Activate two-factor authentication, if not yet done, to enable token generation.) --> Set "Token name" to `Gabriel TestPyPI` (using your name); set "Scope" to `Entire account (all projects)` --> click "Create token". Follow the instructions there. ie: create a `~/.pypirc` file with the following contents:
        `~/.pypirc`:
        ```ini
        [testpypi]
        username = __token__
        password = <your TestPyPI API token here, without the angle brackets>

        [pypi]
        username = __token__
        password = <your PyPI API token here, without the angle brackets>
        ```
        Paste your TestPyPI API token into the `password` field under `[testpypi]`, and save the file. 
    1. Upload 
        ```bash
        python3 -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
        ```
1. Test an installation in a virtual environment from TestPyPI:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv ~/venvs/test_eRCaGuy_PyColors
    . ~/venvs/test_eRCaGuy_PyColors/bin/activate
    pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --no-deps eRCaGuy_PyColors
    ```
    Test that it works as expected.
1. Upload to PyPI using twine:
    1. Obtain an API token at https://pypi.org/manage/account/#api-tokens --> "Add API token" --> (Activate two-factor authentication, if not yet done, to enable token generation.) --> Set "Token name" to `Gabriel PyPI` (using your name); set "Scope" to `Entire account (all projects)` --> click "Create token". Follow the instructions there. ie: update your `~/.pypirc` file by pasting in your token under the `[pypi]` section as shown above.
    1. Upload
        ```bash
        python3 -m twine upload dist/*
        ```
1. Test an installation in a virtual environment from PyPI:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv ~/venvs/eRCaGuy_PyColors
    . ~/venvs/eRCaGuy_PyColors/bin/activate
    pip install eRCaGuy_PyColors
    ```
    Test that it works as expected.
