**Timesat** provides Python bindings for the [TIMESAT](https://github.com/TIMESAT) algorithms — a suite of routines for analyzing time-series of satellite remote sensing data.  
This package wraps the original **Fortran-based TIMESAT core** into a modern Python interface for convenient use in data analysis and research workflows.

---

## Features

- Native Python bindings for the **TIMESAT Fortran core**
- Cross-platform precompiled binaries (macOS Intel & ARM, Linux, Windows)
- Supports **Python 3.10–3.12**
- Compatible with **NumPy ≥ 2.0**
- Provides high performance through the compiled Fortran backend
- Simple API for fitting and extracting vegetation metrics from time-series data

---

## Installation

You can install the latest release directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install timesat
```

## Version log

## 4.2.1 – License Change

Starting from version 4.2.1, TIMESAT is licensed under the
TIMESAT Research License.

This software is now licensed for non-commercial scientific research,
academic teaching, and personal use only.

Commercial use requires a separate written agreement with the authors.

Versions prior to v4.2.1 remain available under their original license.

### 4.1.12 – Debugged Windows parallel processing

### 4.1.11 – Added parallel processing

### 4.1.10 – Improved NoData Handling
Pixels whose land-cover class is not included in the SETTINGS table now receive a proper NoData value instead of zero.

### 4.1.9 – Performance release
- Build system updated to compile the Fortran core with high-optimization for improved runtime performance.
- Minor internal clean-ups to keep behaviour consistent across platforms.
- Note: Due to more aggressive optimization, very small floating-point differences (round-off level) may occur compared to earlier versions.

### 4.1.8 – Bugfixes and QA improvements
- **Fixed:** Issue related to handling of negative slopes in the time-series processing.
- **Added:** Switch for VPP (vegetation peak/phenology) calculation to give users more control over how metrics are derived.
- **Added:** `yfitqa` output for basic quality assessment of the fitted time-series.
