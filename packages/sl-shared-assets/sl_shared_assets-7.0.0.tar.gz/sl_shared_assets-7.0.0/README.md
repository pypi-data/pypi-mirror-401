## Detailed Description

This library makes the two main Sun lab libraries used for data acquisition 
([sl-experiment](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-experiment)) and processing 
([sl-forgery](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-forgery)) independent of each other.

The library broadly stores two types of assets. First, it stores dataclasses used to save the data acquired in the lab 
and configure data acquisition and processing runtimes. Second, it provides the low-level tools and methods used to 
manage the data at all stages of Sun lab data workflow: acquisition, processing, and analysis.

## Installation

### Source

Note, installation from source is ***highly discouraged*** for anyone who is not an active project developer.

1. Download this repository to the local machine using the preferred method, such as git-cloning. Use one of the 
   [stable releases](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-shared-assets/releases) that include precompiled binary and 
   source code distribution (sdist) wheels.
2. If the downloaded distribution is stored as a compressed archive, unpack it using the appropriate decompression tool.
3. ```cd``` to the root directory of the prepared project distribution.
4. Run ```python -m pip install .``` to install the project. Alternatively, if using a distribution with precompiled
   binaries, use ```python -m pip install WHEEL_PATH```, replacing 'WHEEL_PATH' with the path to the wheel file.

### pip

Use the following command to install the library using pip: ```pip install sl-shared-assets```.

## Usage

Most library components are intended to be used via other Sun lab libraries. For details on using shared 
assets for data acquisition and preprocessing, see the [sl-experiment](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-experiment) 
library. For details on using shared assets for data processing and dataset formation, see the 
[sl-forgery](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/sl-forgery) library.

***Warning!*** End users should not use any component of this library directly or install this library into any Python
environment. All assets from this library are intended to be used exclusively by developers working on other Sun lab
libraries.

### MCP Server

This library provides an MCP server that exposes configuration management tools for AI agent integration. The server
enables agents to query and configure shared Sun lab workflow components.

#### Starting the Server

Start the MCP server using the CLI:

```bash
sl-configure mcp
```

## API Documentation

Developers working on integrating sl-shared-assets into other libraries should see the 
[API documentation](https://sl-shared-assets-api-docs.netlify.app/) for the detailed description of the methods and 
classes exposed by components of this library.

**Note!** The API documentation includes important information about the 'configuration' Command-Line Interface (CLI)
exposed by this library.

## Development

This section provides guidance for developers extending this library.

### Adding New Acquisition Systems

The library uses registry patterns to support multiple data acquisition systems. Each system requires configuration
dataclasses. The following steps outline how to add support for a new acquisition system.

**Step 1: Add the system to the AcquisitionSystems enum**

In `configuration_utilities.py`, add a new entry to the `AcquisitionSystems` enum:

```python
from enum import StrEnum
class AcquisitionSystems(StrEnum):
    MESOSCOPE_VR = "mesoscope"
    NEW_SYSTEM = "new_system"  # Add new system here
```

**Step 2: Create the system configuration module**

Create a new file (e.g., `new_system_configuration.py`) containing:

- A system configuration dataclass inheriting from `YamlConfig` with hardware and software settings
- An experiment configuration dataclass for runtime experiment parameters
- A `save()` method if custom serialization logic is needed

**Step 3: Update type aliases and registries**

In `configuration_utilities.py`:

1. Extend the `SystemConfiguration` type alias to include the new configuration class
2. Extend the `ExperimentConfiguration` type alias to include the new experiment configuration class
3. Add an entry to `_SYSTEM_CONFIG_CLASSES` mapping the system name to its configuration class
4. Create an experiment factory function and register it in `_EXPERIMENT_CONFIG_FACTORIES`

**Step 4: Update downstream libraries**

Coordinate changes with sl-experiment (data acquisition) and sl-forgery (data processing) as needed.
