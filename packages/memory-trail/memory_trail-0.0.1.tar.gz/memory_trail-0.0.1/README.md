## Status: Coming Soon

This package is part of the [Clarity Gate](https://github.com/frmoretto/clarity-gate) ecosystem for epistemic quality verification.

**Functionality is under development.**

## What Will This Do?

`memory-trail` will help you maintain continuity across AI-assisted development sessions:

- **Decision Memory**: Track why architectural choices were made
- **Session Logging**: Maintain context across conversation boundaries
- **Confidence Protocols**: Document certainty levels for decisions
- **Agent Coordination**: Share context between different AI agents

## Use Cases

- Track decisions made during multi-session development projects
- Maintain "why" documentation alongside "what" documentation
- Coordinate context between Claude, Copilot, and other AI assistants
- Create audit trails for AI-assisted architectural decisions
