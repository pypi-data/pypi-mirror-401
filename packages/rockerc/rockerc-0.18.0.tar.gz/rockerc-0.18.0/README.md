## Installation

To quickly install `rockerc` and its executables, follow these steps:

1. **Install [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):**
	```bash
	curl -Ls https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | bash
	```

2. **Install rockerc and executables from rocker:**
	```bash
	uv tool install rockerc --with-executables-from rocker
	```

This will install `rockerc` and make its CLI tools available in your environment.

## Architecture

rockerc follows a layered architecture designed for maximum code reuse between terminal and VSCode workflows:

### Base Layer
- **rockerc**: Core container management tool that reads `rockerc.yaml` files and launches containers
- **rockervsc**: Light wrapper on rockerc with the same interface, adds VSCode integration

### Environment Layer
- **renv**: Multi-repository environment manager that collects configuration arguments and passes them to rockerc
- **renvvsc**: Functions the same as renv, but passes arguments to rockervsc instead of rockerc

### Benefits of this Architecture
- **Maximum code reuse**: Changes in core functionality automatically benefit both terminal and VSCode workflows
- **Consistent interfaces**: All tools share the same command-line interface and configuration format
- **Easy maintenance**: Bug fixes and features only need to be implemented once in the base layer

This design ensures that whether you're using terminal-based development or VSCode integration, you get the same robust container management with your preferred interface.

## Usage

navigate to a directory with a `rockerc.yaml` file and run:
```
rockerc
```

This will search recursively for rockerc.yaml and pass those arguments to rocker

### Unified Detached Execution & VS Code Integration

`rockerc` now always launches (or reuses) the container in **detached** mode and then opens an interactive shell via `docker exec`. This avoids stdin/TTY interference and enables a reliable VS Code attach workflow.

Basic run (detached + shell):
```
rockerc
```

Attach VS Code as well (exact same container) using the new flag:
```
rockerc --vsc
```

For convenience, the `rockervsc` command is just an alias for:
```
rockerc --vsc
```

#### What Happens Under the Hood
1. Merge global (`~/.rockerc.yaml`) and project `rockerc.yaml` config.
2. If a `dockerfile` key exists, build a tagged image and strip the `pull` extension.
3. Ensure required rocker flags are injected:
	* `--detach`
	* `--name <container>` / `--image-name <container>`
	* Workspace volume mount: `<project>:/workspaces/<container>`
4. Run `rocker` only if the container does not already exist.
5. (Optional) Launch VS Code: `code --folder-uri vscode-remote://attached-container+<hex>/workspaces/<container>`
6. Open an interactive shell with `docker exec -it <container> $SHELL`.

#### Reusing Containers
If a container with the derived name already exists, rockerc reuses it (skips rocker invocation) and simply attaches shell / VS Code (if `--vsc`).

Force a fresh container (timestamp-rename the old one):
```
rockerc --force
rockerc --vsc --force
```

#### Environment Variables
You can tune startup wait timing (useful on slower hosts) with:
* `ROCKERC_WAIT_TIMEOUT` (default: 20 seconds)
* `ROCKERC_WAIT_INTERVAL` (default: 0.25 seconds)

#### Create Dockerfile Artifacts
If you include `create-dockerfile` in args or pass `--create-dockerfile`, a `Dockerfile.rocker` and `run_dockerfile.sh` script are generated using rocker's dry-run output.

#### Notes & Caveats
* Using `--rm` in custom extra args is discouraged with `--vsc` since closing the shell would remove the container out from under VS Code.
* The volume mount path is standardized to `/workspaces/<container>` to match VS Code's remote container expectations.
* Existing behavior of merging & deduplicating extensions (`args`) and blacklist remains unchanged.

`rockervsc` forwards all arguments to `rockerc`, so you can use any `rockerc` options:
```
rockervsc --gemini
```

The command will:
1. Run `rockerc` with your arguments plus container configuration for VS Code
2. Launch VS Code and attach it to the container
3. If the container already exists, it will just attach VS Code without recreating it

For multi-repository development with git worktrees and VS Code, use `renvsc`:
```
renvsc owner/repo@branch
```

`renvsc` combines the full functionality of `renv` (repository and worktree management) with automatic VS Code integration. See [renv.md](renv.md) for complete documentation.

## Motivation

[Rocker](https://github.com/osrf/rocker) is an alternative to docker-compose that makes it easier to run containers with access to features of the local environment and add extra capabilities to existing docker images.  However rocker has many configurable options and it can get hard to read or reuse those arguments.  This is a naive wrapper that read a rockerc.yaml file and passes them to rocker.  There are currently [no plans](https://github.com/osrf/rocker/issues/148) to integrate docker-compose like functionality directly into rocker so I made this as a proof of concept to see what the ergonomics of it would be like. 

## Caveats

I'm not sure this is the best way of implementing rockerc like functionality.  It might be better to implemented it as a rocker extension, or in rocker itself.  This was just the simplest way to get started. I may explore those other options in more detail in the future. 


# rocker.yaml configuration

You need to pass either a docker image, or a relative path to a dockerfile

rockerc.yaml
```yaml
image: ubuntu:22.04
```

or

```yaml
dockerfile: Dockerfile
```

will look for the dockerfile relative to the rockerc.yaml file
