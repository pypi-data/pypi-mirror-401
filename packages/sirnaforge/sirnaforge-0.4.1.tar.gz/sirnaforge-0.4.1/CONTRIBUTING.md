## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Development Setup

```bash
# Fork the repository on GitHub, then clone
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/sirnaforge.git
cd sirnaforge

# Set up development environment
make install-dev
# or manually:
uv sync --dev
uv run pre-commit install
```

### 2. Development Workflow

```bash
# Create a feature branch
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name

# Make your changes and add tests
# Run the development checks
make check  # Runs linting and tests

# Format your code
make format

# Commit with descriptive messages
git commit -m "feat: add new siRNA scoring algorithm"

# Push and create pull request
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

## 📋 Development Standards

### Code Quality
- **Type Hints**: All code must include proper type annotations
- **Testing**: New features require corresponding tests
- **Documentation**: Update docstrings and README as needed
- **Formatting**: Code is automatically formatted with Ruff

### Testing
```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run tests with coverage
make test-cov

# Run specific test files
uv run pytest tests/unit/test_specific_module.py -v
```

### Linting & Formatting
```bash
# Check code quality
make lint

# Auto-format code
make format
```

- Integration tests in `tests/integration/`
- Pipeline tests in `tests/pipeline/`

### Test Coverage
- Aim for >90% code coverage
- Focus on critical paths and edge cases
- Include both positive and negative test cases

### Mock External Dependencies
- Mock file I/O operations
- Mock network requests
- Mock external tools (ViennaRNA, alignment tools)
