## [Unreleased]

## [0.4.0] - 2025-1-5

### Breaking

- Drop support for Python 3.9; minimum supported Python is now 3.10. This
  enables PEP 604 union syntax (e.g. `list[str] | None`) and other modern
  typing features. Update developer environments, CI, and pre-commit hooks to
  use Python 3.10 or later.


### New Features
- **Variant Targeting Implementation**: Complete Phase 1-5 implementation for targeting specific genetic variants
  - Core variant models and resolver infrastructure with Parquet-based caching
  - Population-specific AF filtering for geographic variant targeting
  - Phase 5 workflow integration with CLI flags for variant_mode parameter
  - Comprehensive variant feature implementation summary and documentation
- **Enhanced CLI and Workflow Integration**:
  - Off-target-only entry point for pre-designed siRNA candidates
  - Support for any sequence length in thermodynamic calculations
  - Improved CLI enum integration for variant_mode parameter
- **Docker and Container Improvements**:
  - Python 3.12 upgrade with optimized Dockerfile targeting
  - Login shell PATH preservation with `/etc/profile.d/conda-path.sh`
  - Enhanced container testing with dedicated test categories
  - Improved Docker entrypoint and health checks

### Improvements
- **Performance Optimizations**:
  - Parquet-based variant cache for improved performance
  - Cache-first index reuse with complete validation
  - Transcriptome filtering and major refactoring for simplicity
  - Unified cache management with Pythonic interface
- **CI/CD Pipeline Enhancements**:
  - Python 3.12 requirement across all workflows
  - Aligned pre-commit mypy with uv package manager
  - Enhanced release workflow with comprehensive testing
  - Improved Docker build and test categorization
- **Code Quality and Maintenance**:

- **uv Package Manager**: Full alignment with uv for faster dependency resolution

### Performance
- **Variant Caching**: Parquet-based storage for improved variant data performance
- **Memory Optimization**: Reduced memory requirements for Docker-constrained environments
- **Parallel Processing**: Enhanced concurrent execution for variant analysis
- **Index Reuse**: Cache-first approach for transcriptome indices


## [0.3.4] - 2025-12-31

### Added
- **Transcript Annotation Provider Layer**: New data provider interface for fetching genomic transcript annotations
  - Added `AbstractTranscriptAnnotationClient` interface in `src/sirnaforge/data/base.py`
  - Implemented `EnsemblTranscriptModelClient` using Ensembl REST API (lookup/id and overlap/region endpoints)
  - Added `VepConsequenceClient` stub for optional VEP enrichment (behind config flag, placeholder implementation)
  - New Pydantic models: `Interval`, `TranscriptAnnotation`, and `TranscriptAnnotationBundle` in `src/sirnaforge/models/transcript_annotation.py`
  - In-memory LRU cache with TTL for transcript annotations
  - Support for fetching by stable IDs or genomic regions
  - Comprehensive unit tests with mocked REST responses
  - Integration tests for real Ensembl REST API (gated by `@pytest.mark.requires_network`)

### Improvements
- **Extensible Architecture**: Transcript annotation provider follows the same layered pattern as existing data providers (gene search, ORF analysis, transcriptome management)
- **Reference Tracking**: Annotations include provenance metadata (provider, endpoint, reference choice) for reproducibility
- **Error Handling**: Robust handling of unresolved IDs and network errors with fallback to unresolved list

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive docstrings for all new classes and methods
- Unit and integration tests serve as usage examples


## [0.3.3] - 2025-12-15

### Bug Fixes
- **Docker Login Shell PATH**: Fixed issue #37 where login shells (`/bin/bash -lc`) would reset PATH and drop `/opt/conda/bin`, making `sirnaforge` and `nextflow` unavailable
  - Added `/etc/profile.d/conda-path.sh` to preserve conda toolchain paths in login shells
  - Non-login shells continue to work as before
  - Added regression test `test_docker_login_shell_path()` to container test suite
  - Added standalone test script `scripts/test-docker-login-shell.sh` for manual verification
- **Nextflow Off-target Aggregation**: Fixed a Groovy/DSL2 runtime crash during final aggregation (`No signature of method ... call(LinkedList)`) by correcting channel collection/defaulting semantics in the embedded workflow
  - Replaced invalid `ifEmpty([])`/`ifEmpty('')` usage with `ifEmpty { [] }`/`ifEmpty { '' }`
  - Switched from `collect()` to `toList()` for explicit channel materialization before combining genome + miRNA result lists


## [0.3.1] - 2025-12-04

### Added
- **Dirty Control Injection**: `workflow.py` now carries the worst rejected guides forward as "dirty control" candidates (see `sirnaforge/utils/control_candidates.py`) so every Nextflow/off-target run includes known-failing sentinels for health checks.

### Improvements
- **Resilient Aggregation & Reporting**: Nextflow modules (`modules/local/aggregate_results.nf`, `mirna_offtarget_analysis.nf`, `split_candidates.nf`, etc.) plus `pipeline/nextflow_cli.py` were refactored to emit consolidated TSV/JSON artefacts even when some analyses are skipped, ensuring miRNA/genome summaries always arrive in `workflow_output/`.
- **Deterministic Caching**: New cache utilities expose `SIRNAFORGE_CACHE_DIR`/XDG-aware paths and tag Nextflow workdirs with metadata, dramatically reducing repeated downloads and making cleanup predictable.
- **Workflow Parameter Safety**: CLI defaults now enforce valid GC range/length boundaries and automatically fall back to the bundled Ensembl transcriptome set (`ensembl_human_cdna`, `ensembl_mouse_cdna`, `ensembl_rat_cdna`, `ensembl_macaque_cdna`) when no input is provided, preventing empty design runs.

### Bug Fixes
- **Pipeline Robustness**: Aggregation handles missing combined TSVs, gracefully copies per-species miRNA batches, and logs explicit workdir pointers so failed runs can be recovered without manual spelunking.
- **Nextflow Reliability**: All embedded DSL2 modules gained scoped retries, consistent BWA-MEM2 index prep, and container profile detection, eliminating the intermittent crashes seen in long off-target analyses.

### Documentation
- **Docs v2 Stack**: Added a parallel `docs_v2/` tree with autogenerated CLI/API references, live `sirnaforge` command output, and refreshed installation guides focused on Docker + Nextflow workflows.
- **Workflow & Tutorial Refresh**: `docs/getting_started.md`, `docs/usage_examples.md`, and the new Nextflow tutorial now describe dirty controls, cache locations, and off-target artefacts so users can reproduce the updated pipeline end-to-end.
