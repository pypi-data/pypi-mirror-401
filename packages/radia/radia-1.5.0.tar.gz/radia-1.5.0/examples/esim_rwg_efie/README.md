# ESIM + RWG-EFIE Examples

This folder contains examples demonstrating the integration of ESIM (Effective Surface Impedance Method) with RWG-EFIE (Rao-Wilton-Glisson Electric Field Integral Equation) solvers for induction heating analysis.

## Demo Scripts

### 1. demo_esim_rwg_nonlinear.py
Demonstrates the nonlinear coupled EFIE solver with ESIM for analyzing ferromagnetic workpieces:
- ESI table generation from B-H curve
- Nonlinear iteration with underrelaxation
- Power loss computation
- Field-dependent surface impedance

### 2. demo_pfft_acceleration.py
Demonstrates pFFT (Pre-corrected FFT) acceleration for large-scale problems:
- O(N log N) matrix-vector products instead of O(N^2)
- Memory reduction for large problems
- Integration with iterative solvers

### 3. demo_hybrid_peec_rwg.py
Demonstrates the hybrid PEEC + RWG solver:
- PEEC for wire/coil modeling (thin-wire approximation)
- RWG for workpiece surface currents
- Mutual coupling between coil and workpiece
- Optimal DOF allocation

### 4. demo_loop_star_decomposition.py
Demonstrates Loop-Star decomposition for low-frequency stability:
- Eliminates low-frequency breakdown in EFIE
- Separates inductive (Loop) and capacitive (Star) effects
- MQS mode for induction heating (Loop-only)
- Reduced DOF and faster computation

## Quick Start

```python
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '../../src/radia')

from rwg_efie_solver import (
    RWGMesh,
    NonlinearCoupledEFIESolver,
    create_nonlinear_solver,
    create_induction_heating_model_with_esim,
)
from esim_cell_problem import ESITable

# Define B-H curve
STEEL_BH_CURVE = [
    [0, 0], [100, 0.2], [500, 0.9], [1000, 1.3],
    [5000, 1.8], [10000, 1.95], [50000, 2.1],
]

# Create meshes
coil_mesh = RWGMesh()
coil_mesh.create_circular_disk(center=[0,0,0.01], radius=0.03, normal=[0,0,1])

workpiece_mesh = RWGMesh()
workpiece_mesh.create_rectangular_plate(center=[0,0,0], Lx=0.1, Ly=0.1, normal=[0,0,1])

# Create solver using helper function
solver = create_nonlinear_solver(
    coil_mesh=coil_mesh,
    workpiece_mesh=workpiece_mesh,
    bh_curve=STEEL_BH_CURVE,
    sigma=2e6,       # Hot steel conductivity
    frequency=50000  # 50 kHz
)

# Solve
solver.set_voltage_excitation(10.0)  # 10V
result = solver.solve()

print(f"Heating power: {result['power_workpiece']:.2f} W")
```
