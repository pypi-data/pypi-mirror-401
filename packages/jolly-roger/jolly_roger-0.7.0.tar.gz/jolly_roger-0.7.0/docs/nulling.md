# Delay nulling (notch filter)
## How it works

In this mode the frequency data of each timestep/baseline is Fourier transformed to form a delay spectrum. `jolly-roger` can null for delays away from zero (the tracked sky-position), or null the delays towards some nominated sky-direction. The expected delay of a bright source can be computed by examining the difference between the w-terms of the phased direction and the source direction.

## Example

The nulling approach can be accessed through `jolly_tractor`. Examples of its application are below. The left and right columns indicate the before and after of the nulling procedure (here nulling towards the Sun's sky position). The top row shows the dynamic sopectrum (time vs frequency) while the bottom highlight the time vs delay of the data.

Sunrise was approximately in the middle of this observation, as indicated by the sudden excess power seen in the top left figure.

The red dashed lines in the lower panel represents the delay of the Sun as derived from the geometry of the array, with the length of each dash represents the Nyquist zone (i.e. how aliased the source appears in delay space). Nulling can be deactivated if the Nyquist zone of the object is high enough to effectively mean no contribution (typically the case for longer baselines).

Should the source cross over a delay of 0 then that timestep will be flagged, as the intermixed components can not be separated, and nulling would have an adverse effect of the direction being observed.

### Tukey Parameterisation
![Tukey Parameterisation](images/example_tukey.png)

Internal `jolly-roger` uses a tukey window function to smoothly modify visibilities. This window function defines a region that smoothly changes from 1.0 to 0.0. We should in the above figure this specific window is parameterised in `jolly-roger`.

The `outer_width` parameter defines a boundary beyond which the window is all 0.0s. The `tukey_width` defines the interval over which the window function transitions from 1.0 to 0.0. This transition is described as `1 - cos`. Hence, a smaller `outer_width` will taper _more_ of the data, and a smaller `tukey_width` produces a window that transitions _quicker_.

If the `--taper-towards-object` argument is used the tukey taper is inverted to behave like a notch filter. So a smaller `outer_width` will _preserve_ more data. See the below figure.
