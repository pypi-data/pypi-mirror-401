Hatch plugin that adds a packaging [_extra_][extras] to the wheel metadata with pinned dependencies from [`uv.lock`][uvlock].

</div>

## Usage

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[build-system]
requires = [
    "hatchling",
    "hatch-pinned-extra>=0.0.1,<0.1.0",
]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[tool.hatch.metadata.hooks.pinned_extra]
name = "pinned"
```

If your package doesn't have any optional dependencies already, you will need to mark them as _dynamic_:

```toml
# pyproject.toml
[project]
dynamic = [
    "optional-dependencies",
]
```

### Enabling the Plugin

The plugin requires the `HATCH_PINNED_EXTRA_ENABLE` environment variable to be set to activate. This design allows you to control when pinned dependencies are included:

```bash
# Build with pinned dependencies
HATCH_PINNED_EXTRA_ENABLE=1 uv build

# Update lockfile without constraints from pinned dependencies
uv lock --upgrade
```

This approach solves the circular dependency issue where pinned dependencies become constraints during `uv lock --upgrade`, preventing actual upgrades.
