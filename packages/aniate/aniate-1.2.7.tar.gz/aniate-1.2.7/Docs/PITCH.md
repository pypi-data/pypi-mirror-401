# The Pitch

## What if every terminal command had an AI brain?

---

### The Problem

Developers context-switch 100+ times per day.

- Open browser → ChatGPT → copy question → paste → copy answer → paste back
- Forget command syntax → Google → Stack Overflow → adapt → try → fail → repeat
- Write commit messages → think → edit → give up → "fixed stuff"
- Debug errors → read stack trace → Google → rabbit hole → 2 hours gone

**The terminal is where work happens. AI should meet us there.**

---

### The Solution: Aniate

```bash
# Instead of opening ChatGPT
ant coder fix the bug in auth.py

# Instead of Googling
ant shell find all large files over 1GB

# Instead of writing commit messages
ant commit

# Instead of reading error logs
ant fix @error.log
```

**AI that executes. Not AI that chats.**

### Why It's Different

| Other AI Tools | Aniate |
|---------------|--------|
| "Here's how to do it..." | Does it. |
| Browser-based | Terminal-native |
| Copy-paste workflow | Inline execution |
| Generic chatbot | Custom-trained assistants |
| No file access | `@file` injection |
| No persistence | Cloud-synced sessions |
| Same for everyone | Brew your own commands |

### The "Shut Up and Take My Money" Features

#### 1. Brew Your Own AI Commands
```bash
ant brew.cmd "analyze my codebase for security issues"
# Generates: ant secure
# Now you have a security scanner, forever
```

#### 2. One-Shot Execution (No Quotes!)
```bash
ant coder refactor the legacy authentication module
# Not: ant coder "refactor the legacy authentication module"
# Natural terminal experience
```

#### 3. Cloud-Synced Everything
```bash
# MacBook:
ant save important.pdf
ant coder start debug-session
> save my-debug

# Linux Server:
ant fetch important.pdf
ant coder my-debug  # Resume exact conversation
```

#### 4. Encrypted Secrets
```bash
ant secrets.add openai_key
# Stored with PGP encryption
# Even DB admins can't read it
# Access from any machine, any time
```

#### 5. File Injection Magic
```bash
ant coder @main.py @utils.py what does this app do
# Injects full file content into AI context
# No copy-paste, ever
```
