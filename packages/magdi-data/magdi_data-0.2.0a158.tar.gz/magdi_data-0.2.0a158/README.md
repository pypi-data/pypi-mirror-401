# MAGDI Data

This python package named ``magdi_data is`` responsible for data loading to be used for
AI training.
It also contains the definition of a specific dataset structure.

## dataset_meta.json

The dataset_meta.json describes a dataset in the Occurrence Instance Format.
Its properties have to follow a strict format to be readable by humans and machines.

### Terms

#### Occurrence

- An occurrence is a real scanned object. It can have one or more instances (replicates
  or measurements).

#### Instance

- An instance is a digitalized object.
