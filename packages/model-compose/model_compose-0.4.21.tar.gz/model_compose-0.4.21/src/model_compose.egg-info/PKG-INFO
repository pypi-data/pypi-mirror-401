# 🤖 Model-Compose

**model-compose** is a declarative AI workflow orchestrator inspired by `docker-compose`. It lets you define and run AI model pipelines using simple YAML files — no custom code required. Effortlessly connect external AI services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, etc.), run local AI models, integrate vector stores, and more — all within powerful, composable workflows.

**No custom code. Just YAML configuration.**

## ✨ Features

### 🎨 **No-Code AI Orchestration**
Define complex AI workflows entirely in YAML—no Python, no JavaScript, no coding required. Connect multiple AI services, models, and APIs through simple declarative configuration.

### 🔗 **Universal AI Service Integration**
Connect to any AI provider out of the box—OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, ElevenLabs, Stability AI, Replicate, or any custom HTTP API. Mix and match services in a single workflow.

### 🖥️ **Local Model Execution**
Run models from HuggingFace and other sources locally with native support for transformers, PyTorch, and model serving frameworks. Fine-tune models with LoRA/PEFT, train with custom datasets, all through YAML configuration.

### ⚡ **Real-Time Streaming**
Built-in SSE (Server-Sent Events) streaming for real-time AI responses. Stream from OpenAI, Claude, local models, or any streaming API with automatic chunking and connection management.

### 🔄 **Advanced Workflow Composition**
Build multi-step pipelines with conditional logic, data transformation, and parallel execution. Pass data between jobs with powerful variable binding—`${input}`, `${response}`, `${env}`, with type conversion and defaults.

### 🚀 **Production-Ready Deployment**
Deploy as HTTP REST API or MCP (Model Context Protocol) server by changing one line. Includes concurrency control, health checks, and automatic API documentation.

### 🎯 **Event-Driven Architecture**
HTTP Callback listeners for async workflows (image generation, video processing). HTTP Trigger listeners for webhooks and external events. Build reactive AI systems that respond to real-world events.

### 🌐 **Smart Tunneling & Gateways**
Expose local services to the internet instantly with ngrok, Cloudflare, or SSH tunnels. Perfect for webhook integration and public API deployment without complex networking.

### 🐳 **Container-Native Deployment**
First-class Docker support with runtime configuration, volume mounting, and environment management. Deploy to any cloud provider or Kubernetes cluster with minimal configuration.

### 🎨 **Instant Web UI**
Add a visual interface with just 2 lines—get Gradio-powered chat UI or serve custom static frontends. Test workflows, monitor executions, and debug pipelines visually.

### 🗄️ **RAG & Vector Database Ready**
Native integration with ChromaDB, Milvus, Pinecone, and Weaviate. Build retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems with embedding search, document indexing, and semantic retrieval.

### 🔧 **Flexible Component System**
Reusable components with multi-action support. Define once, use everywhere. Mix HTTP clients, local models, vector stores, shell commands, and custom workflows in any combination.

## 📦 Installation

```
pip install model-compose
```

Or install from source:

```
git clone https://github.com/hanyeol/model-compose.git
cd model-compose
pip install -e .
```

> Requires: Python 3.9 or higher

---

## 🚀 Quick Start

Create a `model-compose.yml`:

```yaml
controller:
  type: http-server
  port: 8080
  webui:
    port: 8081

components:
  - id: chatgpt
    type: http-client
    base_url: https://api.openai.com/v1
    path: /chat/completions
    method: POST
    headers:
      Authorization: Bearer ${env.OPENAI_API_KEY}
    body:
      model: gpt-4o
      messages:
        - role: user
          content: ${input.prompt}

workflows:
  - id: chat
    default: true
    jobs:
      - component: chatgpt
```

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
```

Run it:

```bash
model-compose up
```

Your API is now live at `http://localhost:8080` and Web UI at `http://localhost:8081` 🎉

## 🎯 Powerful Yet Simple

### 🖥️ Add Web UI with 2 Lines
```yaml
controller:
  webui:
    port: 8081
```

### 🛰️ Switch to MCP Server with 1 Line
```yaml
controller:
  type: mcp-server
```

### 🔄 Run Components in Separate Processes
```yaml
component:
  runtime: process
```

### 🐳 Deploy in Docker with 1 Line
```yaml
controller:
  runtime: docker
```
