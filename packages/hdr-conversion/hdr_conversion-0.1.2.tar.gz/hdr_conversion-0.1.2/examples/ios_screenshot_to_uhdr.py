"""iOS HDR Screenshot to UltraHDR Conversion Example.

This example demonstrates how to:
1. Read an iOS HDR screenshot (HEIC format)
2. Write directly as UltraHDR (JPEG with gainmap) without intermediate HDR conversion

Requirements:
    - MP4Box (from GPAC package)
    - ffmpeg
    
Install on macOS:
    brew install gpac ffmpeg
