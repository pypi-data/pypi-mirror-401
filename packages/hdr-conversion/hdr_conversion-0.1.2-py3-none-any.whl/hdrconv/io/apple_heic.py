"""Apple HEIC HDR format I/O operations.

This module provides functions for reading Apple's proprietary HDR format
from iPhone HEIC photos, which contains a base SDR image and a single-channel
gain map as an auxiliary image.

Public APIs:
    - `read_apple_heic`: Read HEIC file to AppleHeicData

The gain map uses Apple's URN (urn:com:apple:photo:2020:aux:hdrgainmap) and
is stored at 1/4 resolution of the main image.

Note:
    Requires exiftool to be installed for headroom metadata extraction.
