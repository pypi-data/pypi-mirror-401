# /aur:search - Search indexed code
SEARCH_TEMPLATE = f"""{BASE_GUARDRAILS}

**Usage**
Run `aur mem search "<query>"` to search indexed code.

**Argument Parsing**
User can provide search terms with optional flags in natural order:
- `/aur:search bm25 limit 5` → `aur mem search "bm25" --limit 5`
- `/aur:search "exact phrase" type function` → `aur mem search "exact phrase" --type function`
- `/aur:search authentication` → `aur mem search "authentication"`

Parse intelligently: detect `limit N`, `type X` as flags, rest as query terms.

**Examples**
```bash
# Basic search
aur mem search "authentication handler"

# Search with type filter
aur mem search "validate" --type function

# Search with more results
aur mem search "config" --limit 20

# Natural argument order
aur mem search "bm25" --limit 5
```

**Reference**
- Returns file paths and line numbers
- Uses hybrid BM25 + embedding search
- Shows match scores
- Type filters: function, class, module

**Output Format (MANDATORY - NEVER DEVIATE)**

Every response MUST follow this exact structure:

1. Execute `aur mem search` with parsed args
2. Display the **FULL TABLE** - never collapse with "... +N lines"
3. Create a simplified table showing ALL results (not just top 3):
   ```
   #  | File:Line           | Type | Name              | Score
   ---|---------------------|------|-------------------|------
   1  | memory.py:131       | code | MemoryManager     | 0.81
   2  | tools.py:789        | code | _handle_record    | 0.79
   3  | logs/query.md:1     | docs | Execution Summary | 0.58
   ...
   ```
4. Add exactly 2 sentences of guidance on where to look:
   - Sentence 1: Identify the most relevant result(s) and why
   - Sentence 2: Suggest what other results might provide useful context
5. Single line: `Next: /aur:get N`

NO additional explanations or questions beyond these 2 sentences."""

# /aur:get - Get chunk by index
GET_TEMPLATE = f"""{BASE_GUARDRAILS}

**Usage**
Run `aur mem get <N>` to retrieve the full content of search result N from the last search.

**Examples**
```bash
# Get first result from last search
aur mem get 1

# Get third result
aur mem get 3
```

**Note:** The output includes detailed score breakdown (Hybrid, BM25, Semantic, Activation). For access count details, see the Activation score.

**Workflow**
1. Run `/aur:search <query>` to search
2. Review the numbered results
3. Run `/aur:get <N>` to see full content of result N

**Output**
- Full code content (not truncated)
- File path and line numbers
- Detailed score breakdown (Hybrid, BM25, Semantic, Activation)
- Syntax highlighting

**Notes**
- Results cached for 10 minutes after search
- Index is 1-based (first result = 1)
- Returns error if no previous search or index out of range

**Output Format (MANDATORY - NEVER DEVIATE)**

Every response MUST follow this exact structure:

1. Execute `aur mem get N`
2. Display the content box
3. One sentence: what this is and what it does (include file:line reference from the header)
4. If not code implementation: note the file type (e.g., "log file", "docs", "config")
5. Optional: If relevant to other search results, add: "See also: result #X (relationship)"

NO additional explanations, suggestions, or questions."""

# /aur:implement - Plan implementation
IMPLEMENT_TEMPLATE = f"""{BASE_GUARDRAILS}

**Usage**
Execute plan tasks sequentially with checkpoint support.

**What it does**
1. Reads plan.md, tasks.md, and specs/ from plan directory
2. Executes tasks in order, marking each `- [x]` when complete
3. Saves checkpoint after each task for resume capability
4. Validates completed work against spec scenarios when available

**Commands**
```bash
# Implement specific plan
/aur:implement 0001-add-auth

# Resume interrupted implementation
/aur:implement 0001-add-auth --resume

# Interactive selection (lists active plans)
/aur:implement
```

**Workflow**
1. Read `.aurora/plans/active/<plan-id>/plan.md` for context
2. Read `.aurora/plans/active/<plan-id>/tasks.md` for work items
3. Check `specs/` for formal requirements and scenarios (if exists)
4. For each task:
   - Execute the implementation
   - Run validation (tests, checks) from task description
   - Mark task complete: `- [ ]` → `- [x]`
   - Save checkpoint to `.aurora/checkpoints/`
5. On completion: suggest `/aur:archive <plan-id>`

**Resume Mode**
When `--resume` is passed:
1. Read latest checkpoint from `.aurora/checkpoints/`
2. Skip already-completed tasks (marked `- [x]`)
3. Continue from first incomplete task

**Validation**
- If `specs/<capability>/spec.md` exists, use scenarios as acceptance criteria
- Mark validation pass/fail in task completion notes
- Warn if spec scenarios not fully covered

**Reference**
- `aur plan list` - See active plans
- `aur plan show <id>` - View plan details
- Checkpoints stored in `.aurora/checkpoints/<plan-id>/`"""

# /aur:plan - Plan generation command (matches OpenSpec proposal template exactly)
PLAN_GUARDRAILS = f"""{BASE_GUARDRAILS}
- Identify any vague or ambiguous details and ask the necessary follow-up questions before editing files.
- Do not write any code during the planning stage. Only create design documents (plan.md, tasks.md, design.md, and spec deltas). Implementation happens in the implement stage after approval."""

PLAN_STEPS = """**Steps**
1. Review `.aurora/project.md`, run `aur plan list` and `aur plan list --specs`, and inspect related code or docs (e.g., via `rg`/`ls`) to ground the plan in current behaviour; note any gaps that require clarification.
   - **If input is a `goals.json` file**: Read it and populate the Goals Context table with subgoals, agents, files, and dependencies.
   - **If input is a prompt**: Run `aur agents list` to see available agents. Assign agents to tasks as you plan.
2. Choose a unique verb-led `plan-id` and scaffold `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `design.md` (when needed) under `.aurora/plans/active/<id>/`.
3. Map the change into concrete capabilities or requirements, breaking multi-scope efforts into distinct spec deltas with clear relationships and sequencing.
4. Capture architectural reasoning in `design.md` when the solution spans multiple systems, introduces new patterns, or demands trade-off discussion before committing to specs.
5. Draft spec deltas in `.aurora/plans/active/<id>/specs/<capability>/spec.md` (one folder per capability) using `## ADDED|MODIFIED|REMOVED Requirements` with at least one `#### Scenario:` per requirement and cross-reference related capabilities when relevant.
6. Draft `tasks.md` with `<!-- @agent: @name -->` comment after each parent task. Agent assignment priority: goals.json > agent registry match > LLM inference.
7. Validate with `aur plan validate <id> --strict` and resolve every issue before sharing the plan."""

PLAN_REFERENCES = """**Reference**
- Use `aur plan show <id> --json --deltas-only` or `aur plan show <spec> --type spec` to inspect details when validation fails.
- Search existing requirements with `rg -n "Requirement:|Scenario:" .aurora/specs` before writing new ones.
- Explore the codebase with `rg <keyword>`, `ls`, or direct file reads so plans align with current implementation realities.

# /aur:checkpoint - Save session context
CHECKPOINT_TEMPLATE = f"""{BASE_GUARDRAILS}

**Usage**
Save current session context to preserve conversation state across compaction or handoffs.

**What it does**
1. Captures current conversation context and key decisions
2. Records active work in progress
3. Stores important findings and insights
4. Creates checkpoint file in `.aurora/checkpoints/`
5. Enables context restoration after compaction

**When to use**
- Before long-running tasks that may trigger compaction
- When handing off work to another agent or session
- After completing major investigation or analysis
- Before taking a break from complex multi-step work

**Commands**
```bash
# Create checkpoint with auto-generated name
aur checkpoint save

# Create checkpoint with custom name
aur checkpoint save "feature-auth-investigation"

# List available checkpoints
aur checkpoint list

# Restore from checkpoint
aur checkpoint restore <checkpoint-name>
```

**Reference**
- Checkpoints stored in `.aurora/checkpoints/`
- Automatically includes: timestamp, active plan, recent decisions
- Maximum context retention with minimal token usage"""

# /aur:archive - Archive completed plans
ARCHIVE_TEMPLATE = f"""{BASE_GUARDRAILS}

**Usage**
Archive completed plans with spec delta processing and validation.

**What it does**
1. Validates plan structure and task completion
2. Processes capability specification deltas (ADDED/MODIFIED/REMOVED/RENAMED)
3. Updates capability specs in `.aurora/capabilities/`
4. Moves plan to archive with timestamp: `.aurora/plans/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-<plan-id>/`
5. Updates agents.json with `archived_at` timestamp

**Commands**
```bash
# Archive specific plan
aur plan archive 0001-oauth-auth

# Interactive selection (lists all active plans)
aur plan archive

# Archive with flags
aur plan archive 0001 --yes              # Skip confirmations
aur plan archive 0001 --skip-specs       # Skip spec delta processing
aur plan archive 0001 --no-validate      # Skip validation (with warning)
```

**Validation checks**
- Task completion status (warns if < 100%)
- Plan directory structure
- Spec delta conflicts and duplicates
- Agent assignments and gaps

**Reference**
- Plans archived to `.aurora/plans/archive/`
- Specs updated in `.aurora/capabilities/<capability>/spec.md`
- Incomplete plans can be archived with explicit confirmation"""
