## Typing stubs for ephem

This is a [type stub package](https://typing.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/external_libraries.html)
for the [`ephem`](https://github.com/brandon-rhodes/pyephem) package. It can be used by type checkers
to check code that uses `ephem`. This version of
`types-ephem` aims to provide accurate annotations for
`ephem==4.2.*`.

This package is part of the [typeshed project](https://github.com/python/typeshed).
All fixes for types and metadata should be contributed there.
See [the README](https://github.com/python/typeshed/blob/main/README.md)
for more details. The source for this package can be found in the
[`stubs/ephem`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/tree/main/stubs/ephem)
directory.

This package was tested with the following type checkers:
* [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy/) 1.19.1
* [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) 1.1.408

It was generated from typeshed commit
[`ee1e94d4309f30e9a6e169da4e4db72aa6a98cc0`](https://github.com/python/typeshed/commit/ee1e94d4309f30e9a6e169da4e4db72aa6a98cc0).
