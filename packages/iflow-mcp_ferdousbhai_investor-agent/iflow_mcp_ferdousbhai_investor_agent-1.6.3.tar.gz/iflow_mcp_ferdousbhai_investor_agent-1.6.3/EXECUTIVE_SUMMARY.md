---

## Key Findings at a Glance

- **High-value audience**: AI developers + fintech engineers (lucrative, engaged, underserved)

### Recommended Investment

- **Budget:** $0-200/month (optional tools)
- **Timeline:** 6-month plan to 4-6x GitHub stars, establish thought leadership

## Comparison to Alternatives

### DIY/No Marketing
- **Pros:** Saves time initially
- **Cons:** 70% missed potential, limited adoption, lost market-share opportunity
- **Verdict:** Poor ROI given emerging market opportunity

### Hire Full-Time Marketer
- **Pros:** Comprehensive execution
- **Cons:** High cost ($60,000-100,000/year), harder to scale down
- **Verdict:** Overkill for phase 1; consider after month 3

### Use Agency
- **Pros:** Professional execution
- **Cons:** $5,000-15,000/month, less authentic voice
- **Verdict:** Only if budget allows; DIY builds stronger community

### Recommended Approach
- **Months 1-2:** Creator handles content + basic social
- **Months 3-4:** Add part-time content marketer (10 hrs/week @ $1,500/month)
- **Months 5+:** Add community manager if traction justifies
- **Sustainable:** Creator focus on product/vision, team handles execution

## Why This Timing is Critical

### Market Window (18-24 Month Window)
1. **MCP Protocol:** Currently in early adoption phase, not saturated
2. **LLM Agent Market:** Explosion of agent frameworks (LangChain, Pydantic AI, etc.)
3. **Financial AI:** Sector heating up, regulatory clarity emerging
4. **First-Mover Advantage:** investor-agent could become the canonical MCP finance tool

### Competitive Landscape
- No comprehensive open-source MCP finance servers exist
- Traditional APIs (yfinance, Alpha Vantage) not optimized for LLMs
- Huge gap between developer need and available tools

### Action Implication
**Do this now.** The window for being "the" MCP finance tool is open. Waiting 6 months means potential competitors entering market.
