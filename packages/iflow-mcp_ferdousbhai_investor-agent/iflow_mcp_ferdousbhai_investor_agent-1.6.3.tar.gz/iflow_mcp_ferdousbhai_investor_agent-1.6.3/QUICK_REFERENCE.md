## The One-Sentence Pitch

**investor-agent**: MCP server for financial data—one unified API instead of five fragmented ones. Caching, error handling, and AI-native design included.

---

## Key Value Props (Pick 2-3 for messaging)

1. **Eliminates API Boilerplate** - 500+ LOC of integration code → 5 lines with investor-agent
2. **AI-Native Design** - Built for LLMs, not humans
3. **Comprehensive Data** - Market movers + sentiment + technicals + fundamentals + options + earnings + insider + institutional
4. **Production-Ready** - 4-layer caching + intelligent retry + error handling
5. **One Interface** - No API key management or switching between libraries

## Tone Guidelines

### DO Sound Like

- "This problem was annoying, I solved it"
- "Have you tried...?"
- "I don't think this is right"
- "Tell me if I'm missing something"

### DON'T Sound Like
- "Buy now!" / "Download today!"
- "This is the only solution"
- "Everyone should use this"
- "Our product is perfect"
- Overly salesy / hype-y

### Example Tone
Good: "I was frustrated managing 5 financial APIs, so I built investor-agent to solve it. Here's how I reduced boilerplate code by 70%."

Bad: "Introducing investor-agent! The ultimate financial API solution! Download now!"

## Motivational Reminders

1. **Good content compounds.** First month feels slow. By month 3, you have momentum.

2. **The best marketing is a great product.** You've built it. Now show people.

3. **Authenticity beats polish.** "Here's what I learned" beats "Buy our solution."

4. **Community > hype.** 10 real supporters > 1,000 people who saw an ad.

5. **Track what works, do more of it.** Weekly reviews prevent wasted effort.

6. **30 minutes/day = significant results.** You don't need 8 hours/day. Consistency matters.

7. **It's okay if growth is slow at first.** PyPI adoption takes weeks/months. Trust the process.

---

## The 30-Day Mission

**By Day 30, you will have:**
- 2-4 published blog posts (2K-4K words each)
- 30+ tweets (authentic, helpful)
- 2-3 Reddit posts (high-engagement)
- 1 Hacker News submission
- 50-100 GitHub stars
- 100-200 PyPI downloads/week
- Growing community (Discussions, comments)
- Content foundation for Month 2

**Result:** investor-agent goes from unknown to "emerging project with real traction."
