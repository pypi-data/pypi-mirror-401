## Common Questions Answered

### "How much time will this really take?"
**Honest answer:**
- Setup: 15-20 hours (one-time)
- Months 1-6: 8-10 hours/week sustained
- Post-month 6: 8-13 hours/week ongoing
- Highest effort: Months 1-2

**Can you do it part-time?**
Yes. Start with 5-8 hours/week in month 1, scale up as you learn.

### "Can I just do the quick wins?"
You can do phase 1 (README, GitHub setup) and skip the rest. But:
- Leaves 70% of opportunity on the table
- Takes only 4 more weeks to do full phase 2
- Compounding returns of content take 3-6 months
- Not worth starting if you'll abandon after 4 weeks

### "Should I hire someone?"
Depends on your situation:
- Solo developer with no marketing experience → Yes, hire month 2-3
- Creator with content skills → No, do it yourself first 6 months
- Well-funded startup → Yes, hire from day 1
- Limited budget → Do it yourself, stay lean

### "What if it doesn't work?"
Unlikely but possible:
- Blog content gets zero traffic → Means poor distribution, try other channels
- Twitter followers don't materialize → Try Reddit, HackerNews instead
- Community doesn't engage → Check communication style, community pain points
- **Mitigation:** Track metrics weekly, adjust channels if underperforming

**Low-risk because:** You're not spending money, you're investing time. If it doesn't work after 2-3 months, you've learned what doesn't work and can pivot.

### "Is this similar to what other projects do?"
Yes and no:
- Most open source projects don't do content marketing (huge gap)
- Successful projects (TensorFlow, FastAPI, Django) all do this
- investor-agent is in perfect position to win this market first

### "How do I measure success?"
Primary metrics:
- GitHub stars growth (should see 50-100/month growth)
- PyPI downloads (should see 20-30% growth)
- Blog traffic (should see 20,000-40,000/month by month 3)

Secondary metrics:
- Twitter followers, newsletter subs, YouTube views
- Community size and engagement
- Backlinks to your content

**Verdict:** You'll know it's working within 4-6 weeks.
