## Common Questions

### "How much will this cost?"
**A:** Zero. All channels are free (Twitter, Reddit, Hacker News, blog). You're investing time, not money.

### "Do I need to do everything?"
**A:** No. Start with 2-3 channels (blog + Twitter + Reddit). Add others later based on what works.

### "How long until I see results?"
**A:** Week 1-2 is building foundation. Week 3-4 first traction. Real momentum by Week 6-8. Trust the process.

### "What if I don't have a blog?"
**A:** Use Medium (free, large audience) or Dev.to (developer-focused). Set up takes 5 minutes.

### "Can I adjust the timeline?"
**A:** Absolutely. Slow down or speed up based on your availability. Consistency matters more than speed.

### "Do I need a team?"
**A:** No. One person can execute everything. A team (3-4 people) makes it easier and faster.

### "What if growth is slow?"
**A:** Review what's working and do more of it. Slow growth is normal in weeks 1-4. Month 2+ is where compounding kicks in.
