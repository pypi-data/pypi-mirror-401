  name: "Principles for the ethical use of artificial intelligence in the United Nations system"
  description: >-
    This set of ten principles, grounded in ethics and human rights, aims to guide the use of artificial intelligence
    (AI) across all stages of an AI system lifecycle across United Nations system entities. It is intended to be read
    with other related policies and international law, and includes the following principles: do no harm; defined
    purpose, necessity and proportionality; safety and security; fairness and non-discrimination; sustainability;
    right to privacy, data protection and data governance; human autonomy and oversight; transparency and
    explainability; responsibility and accountability; and inclusion and participation.

  name: Do no harm
  type: Principle
  description: >-
    Artificial intelligence systems should not be used in ways that cause or exacerbate harm, whether individual or
    collective, including harm to social, cultural, economic, natural or political environments. All stages of an
    artificial intelligence system's life cycle should operate in accordance with the purposes, principles and
    commitments of the Charter of the United Nations. All stages of an artificial intelligence system's life cycle
    should be designed, developed, deployed and operated in ways that respect, protect and promote human rights and
    fundamental freedoms.

  name: Defined p
  type: Principle
  description: >-
    The use of artificial intelligence systems, including the specific
    artificial intelligence method(s) employed, should be justified,
    appropriate in the context and not exceed what is necessary, and
    proportionate to achieve legitimate aims that are in accordance with
    each United Nations system organization's mandate and governing
    instruments, rules, regulations and procedures.

- id: principle-un-safety-and-security
  name: Safety and security
  type: Principle
  description: >-
    Safety and security risks should be identified, addressed and mitigated
    throughout the artificial intelligence system's life cycle to prevent or, at
    least, limit any potential or actual harm to humans, the environment or
    ecosystems. Safe and secure artificial intelligence systems should be
    enabled through robust frameworks.
  hasDocumentation:

- id: principle-un-fairness-and-non-discrimination
  name: Fairness and non-discrimination
  type: Principle
  description: >-
    United Nations system organizations should aim to ensure the equal and
    just distribution of the benefits, risks and costs associated with artificial
    intelligence systems and to prevent bias, discrimination and
    stigmatization of any kind, in compliance with international law. The
    use of artificial intelligence systems should not lead to individuals
    being deceived or to unjustifiable restrictions on their human rights and
    fundamental freedoms.

- id: principle-un-sustainability
  name: Sustainab
  type: Principle
  description: >-
    Artificial intelligence should be aimed at promoting environmental,
    economic and social sustainability. To this end, the human, social,
    cultural, political, economic and environmental impacts of such
    technologies should be continuously assessed and appropriate
    mitigation and prevention measures should be taken to address adverse
    impacts, including on future generations.
  hasDocumentation:

- id: principle-un-right-to-privacy
  name: Right to privacy, data protection and data governance
  type: Principle
  description: >-
    Individuals' privacy and rights as data subjects must be respected,
    protected and promoted throughout the life cycle of artificial
    intelligence systems. When the use of artificial intelligence systems is
    considered, adequate data protection frameworks and data governance
    mechanisms should be established or enhanced, in line with the
    Personal data protection and privacy principles, also to ensure the
    integrity of the data used.

- id: principle-un-human-autonomy-and-oversight
  name: Human autonomy and oversight
  type: Principle
  description: >-
    United Nations system organizations should ensure that artificial
    intelligence systems do not impinge on human beings' freedom and
    autonomy and should guarantee human oversight. All stages of an
    artificial intelligence system's life cycle should follow and incorporate
    human-centric design practices and leave meaningful opportunity for
    human decision-making. Human oversight includes ensuring that
    humans have the capability to manage the overall activity of an
    artificial intelligence system and the ability to decide when and how to
    use it in specific situations, including whether to use such a system, and
    the ability to override a decision made by such a system. As a rule, life
    or death decisions or other decisions affecting fundamental human
    rights require human intervention and must not be ceded to artificial
    intelligence systems.
  hasDocumentation:
  - doc-un-ethical-use-of-ai-principles
- id: principle-un-transparency-and-explainability
  name: Transparency and explainability
  type: Principle
  description: >-
    United Nations system organizations should ensure the transparency
    and explainability of artificial intelligence systems that they use, at all
    stages of their life cycles, and of decision-making processes involving
    such systems.
    Technical explainability requires that the decisions made by an
    artificial intelligence system can be understood and traced by human
    beings. Individuals should be fully informed when a decision that may
    or will affect their rights, fundamental freedoms, entitlements, services
    or benefits is informed by or made based on artificial intelligence
    algorithms, and should have access to the reasons and logic behind such
    decisions. The information and reasons for a decision should be
    presented in a manner that they can understand.

- id: principle-un-responsibility-and-accountability
  name: Responsibility and accountability
  type: Principle
  description: >-
    United Nations system organizations should have appropriate oversight,
    impact assessment, audit and due diligence mechanisms, including
    protection for whistle-blowers, to ensure accountability for the impacts
    of the use of artificial intelligence systems throughout their life cycles.
    Appropriate governance structures should be established or enhanced to
    ensure that humans or legal entities are made ethically and legally
    responsible and accountable for artificial intelligence-based decisions
    made at any stage of an artificial intelligence system's life cycle. Harm
    caused by or as a result of the use of artificial intelligence systems
    should be investigated, and appropriate action taken in response.
    Information on accountability mechanisms should be communicated
    widely throughout the United Nations system in order to build shared
    knowledge, resources and capacities.

- id: principle-un-inclusion-and-participation
  name: Inclusion and participation
  type: Principle
  description: >-
    When designing, deploying and using artificial intelligence systems,
    United Nations system organizations should take an inclusive,
    interdisciplinary and participatory approach, and promote gender
    equality. They should conduct meaningful consultations with all
    relevant stakeholders and affected communities as part of the processes
    of defining the purpose of an artificial intelligence system, identifying
    the assumptions underpinning its use, identifying the associated
    benefits, risks, harm and adverse impacts, and adopting prevention and
    mitigation measures.
