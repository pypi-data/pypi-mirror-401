    name: "IBM's Principles for Trust and Transparency"
    description: >-
      For more than a century, IBM has earned the trust of our clients by responsibly managing their most valuable data.

      And we have worked to earn the trust of society by ushering powerful new technologies into the world responsibly
      and with clear purpose.

      IBM continues to follow core principles, grounded in commitments to trust and transparency, that guide its
      handling of client data and insights. These principles also guide its responsible development and deployment of
      new  technologies, such as IBM Watson® to the more advanced watsonx™.

      We encourage all technology companies to adopt similar principles to protect client data and insights, and to
      ensure the responsible and transparent use of artificial intelligence (AI) and other transformative innovations.
      We offer our own Trust and Transparency Principles here as a roadmap.

    name: "1. The purpose of AI is to augment human intelligence"
    type: Principle
    description: >-
      The purpose of AI and cognitive systems developed and applied by IBM is to augment—not replace—human intelligence.
      Our technology is and will be designed to enhance and extend human capability and potential. At IBM, we believe AI
      should make ALL of us better at our jobs, and that the benefits of the AI era should touch the many, not just the
      elite few. To that end, we are investing in initiatives to help the global workforce gain the skills needed to work
      in partnership with these technologies. That includes preparing more people for new collar jobs, which prioritize
      skills over specific degrees.

    name: "2. Data and insights belong to their creator"
    type: Principle
    description: >-
      IBM clients' data is their data, and their insights are
      their insights. Client data and the insights produced
      on IBM's cloud or from IBM's AI are owned by IBM's
      clients. We believe that government data policies
      should be fair and equitable and prioritize openness.
      Data Ownership Clients are not required to
      relinquish rights to their data—or insights derived
      from it—to have the benefits of IBM's solutions and
      services.
      Data Privacy IBM is fully committed to protecting
      the privacy of our clients' data, which is fundamental
      in a data-driven society.
      Data Security IBM is devoting our powerful engines
      of innovation to create tools to protect our clients,
      their data and global trade from cyber threats, and
      convening a broader discussion on balancing
      security, privacy and freedom.
      Government Access To Data IBM has not provided
      client data to any government agency under any
      surveillance program involving bulk collection of
      content or metadata.
      Cross-Border Data Flows IBM views the free
      movement of data across borders as essential to
      21st century commerce.

    name: "3. New technology, including AI systems, must be transparent and explainable"
    type: Principle
    description: >-
      For the public to trust AI, it must be transparent.
      Technology companies must be clear about who
      trains their AI systems, what data was used in that
      training and, most importantly, what went into their
      algorithm's recommendations. If we are to use AI to
      help make important decisions, it must be
      explainable.
      IBM will make clear:
      When and for what purposes AI is being applied.
      The major sources of data and expertise—and the
      methods—used to train AI systems and solutions.
      That while bias can never be fully eliminated, we and
      all companies advancing AI have an obligation to
      address it proactively. We therefore continually test
      our systems and find new data sets to better align
      their output with human values and expectations.
