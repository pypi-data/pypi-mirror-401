    description: >-
      A specific AI capability or ability, such as reading comprehension, logical reasoning, or code generation.
      Aligned with the W3C DPV AI extension dpv-ai:Capability, representing what an AI technology is capable of achieving or providing.
      Capabilities are distinct from:
      (1) the intended purpose for which the technology is designed,
      (2) the actual tasks performed in a specific deployment context, and
      (3) the technical implementation mechanisms (intrinsics, adapters) that enable the capability.

        range: CapabilityGroup
      requiredByTask:
        description: >-
          Indicates that this capability is required to perform a specific AI task.
          This links abstract capabilities (technical abilities) to concrete tasks (application-level operations).
          An AI system with this capability can perform tasks that require it.
        range: AiTask
      implementedByAdapter:
        description: >-
          Indicates that this capability is implemented by a specific adapter.
          This relationship distinguishes the abstract capability (what can be done) from
          the technical implementation mechanism (how it is added/extended via adapters).

  # Intrinsic-capability relationships
  implementedByIntrinsic:
    description: >-
      Indicates that this capability is implemented by a specific LLM intrinsic.
      This relationship distinguishes the abstract capability (what can be done) from
      the technical implementation mechanism (how it is done at the model component level).
    range: LLMIntrinsic
    multivalued: true
    inlined: false

  # AI System-capability relationships
  possessedByAi:
    description: >-
      Indicates that this capability is possessed by a specific AI system or component.
      Inverse of hasCapability, allowing navigation from capabilities to AI systems.
      This enables queries like "which AI systems have this capability?"
    domain: Capability

    multivalued: true
    inlined: false
    inverse: hasCapability
