  type: CapabilityTaxonomy
  description: >-
    A comprehensive taxonomy of AI capabilities designed to help practitioners
    understand, evaluate, and implement foundation model abilities. This framework
    organizes capabilities into domains and categories, with clear links to tasks,
    benchmarks, and implementation patterns. This taxonomy was informed by analysis
    of multiple external capability frameworks, including BIG-bench capability keywords,
    HELM evaluation scenarios, and OECD AI Capability Indicators.
