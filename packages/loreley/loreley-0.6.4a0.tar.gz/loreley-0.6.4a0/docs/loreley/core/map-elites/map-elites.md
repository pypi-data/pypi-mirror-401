# loreley.core.map_elites.map_elites

High-level manager that runs the MAP-Elites pipeline on git commits and maintains per-island archives backed by the database.

## Data structures

- **`CommitEmbeddingArtifacts`**: immutable container bundling lightweight embedding artifacts for a commit. In repo-state mode this includes repo-state stats plus the final low-dimensional embedding.
- **`MapElitesRecord`**: snapshot of a single elite stored in the archive, including commit hash, island, cell index, fitness, behaviour measures, solution vector, metadata, and timestamp.
- **`MapElitesInsertionResult`**: describes the outcome of attempting to insert a commit into the archive, exposing a status flag, fitness delta, optional `MapElitesRecord`, any intermediate artifacts, and an optional human-readable message.
- **`IslandState`**: internal mutable state attached to each island, holding the `GridArchive`, behaviour bounds, PCA history/projection, and mappings between commits and archive cell indices.

## Manager

- **`MapElitesManager`**: orchestrates preprocessing, chunking, embedding, dimensionality reduction, archive updates, and snapshot persistence.
  - Configured via `Settings` map-elites options: preprocessing and repository file filtering, repo-state code embeddings (file cache), dimensionality reduction (PCA with whitening), feature normalisation/truncation (`MAPELITES_FEATURE_TRUNCATION_K`, `MAPELITES_FEATURE_NORMALIZATION_WARMUP_SAMPLES`, `MAPELITES_FEATURE_CLIP`), archive grid, fitness metric, and default island identifiers.
  - Accepts an optional `experiment_id` at construction time; when provided, all persisted `MapElitesState` rows are scoped by `(experiment_id, island_id)`, allowing multiple experiments to maintain independent archives even when they share island identifiers. When omitted, archive state is kept purely in-memory and snapshots are not written.
  - `ingest(commit_hash, ...)` runs the full pipeline for a commit in **repo-state** embedding mode:
    - enumerates eligible code files at `commit_hash` using pinned ignore rules from the experiment snapshot (`mapelites_repo_state_ignore_text`) plus basic filtering,
    - reuses a file-level embedding cache keyed by git blob SHA,
    - embeds only cache misses (new/changed blobs),
    - aggregates all file embeddings into a single commit vector via **uniform averaging**,
    - reduces it to the behaviour space (PCA), resolves fitness, and updates the island's `GridArchive`.
  - Tracks per-island PCA history and projection so that new embeddings are consistent with previous ones, logging detailed progress and warnings with `loguru`.
  - Behaviour descriptors are clipped to `[-k, k]` (k from `MAPELITES_FEATURE_TRUNCATION_K`), linearly mapped into `[0, 1]^d`, and archives are constructed with fixed `[0, 1]` bounds per dimension to avoid manual per-dimension tuning and boundary crowding.
  - Delegates snapshot serialisation and persistence to `loreley.core.map_elites.snapshot`, which exposes pure helpers for encoding/decoding archive state plus pluggable storage backends (database or no-op).

## Query helpers

- **`get_records(island_id=None)`**: returns all current `MapElitesRecord` entries for an island, rebuilding them from the underlying archive.
- **`sample_records(island_id=None, count=1)`**: randomly samples up to `count` elites from an island's archive for downstream planning or analysis.
- **`clear_island(island_id=None)`**: clears an island's archive and associated PCA history/projection state, removing all stored elites and mappings for that island.
- **`describe_island(island_id=None)`**: returns a small dict of observability stats for an island (ID, occupied cell count, total cells, QD score, and best fitness).
