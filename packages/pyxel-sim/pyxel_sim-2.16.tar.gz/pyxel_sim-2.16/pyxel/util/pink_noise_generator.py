class PinkNoiseGenerator:
    """
    A class for generating pink noise using a filter-based method.

    This class implements a pink noise generator based on the method described
    by Julius O. Smith III for non-periodic pink noise generation. It generates
    pink noise by applying an Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter to white
    noise. The IIR filter used has a 1/f spectral roll-off, which is
    characteristic of pink noise.

    The generated pink noise is normalized to have a unit variance. The filter
    state is maintained between calls to ensure continuous generation of pink
    noise without discontinuities.

    An internal random number generator is initialized with a given seed,
    ensuring reproducibility of the noise sequence even if other calls to
    ``np.random`` are made between calls to the ``get`` method.

        Generate samples of pink noise of the given size.

        This method generates samples of pink noise by filtering samples of a
        white noise through an IIR filter that implements a 1/f spectral
        roll-off. The resulting pink noise is then normalized to have unit
        variance.

        The filter state is maintained between calls to maintain continuity
        between noise samples.
