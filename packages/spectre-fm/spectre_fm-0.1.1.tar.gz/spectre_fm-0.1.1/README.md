SPECTRE is a **Transformer-based foundation model for 3D Computed Tomography (CT) scans**, trained using **self-supervised learning** (SSL) and **cross-modal vision–language alignment** (VLA). It provides rich and generalizable representations from medical imaging data, which can be fine-tuned for downstream tasks such as segmentation, classification, and anomaly detection.  

SPECTRE has been trained on a large cohort of **open-source CT scans** of the **human abdomen and thorax**, as well as **paired radiology reports** and **Electronic Health Record data**, enabling it to capture representations that generalize across datasets and clinical settings.  

This repository provides pretrained SPECTRE models together with tools for fine-tuning and evaluation.

## 🧠 Pretrained Models
The pretrained SPECTRE model can easily be imported as follows:

```python
from spectre import SpectreImageFeatureExtractor, MODEL_CONFIGS
import torch

config = MODEL_CONFIGS['spectre-large-pretrained']
model = SpectreImageFeatureExtractor.from_config(config)
model.eval()

# Dummy input: (batch, crops, channels, height, width, depth)
# For a (3 x 3 x 4) grid of (128 x 128 x 64) CT patches -> Total scan size (384 x 384 x 256)
x = torch.randn(1, 36, 1, 128, 128, 64)
with torch.no_grad():
    features = model(x, grid_size=(3, 3, 4))
print("Features shape:", features.shape)
```

## 📂 Repository Contents

This repository is organized as follows:

- 🚀 **`src/spectre/`** – Contains the core package, including:
  - Pretraining methods
  - Model architectures
  - Data handling and transformations

- 🛠️ **`src/spectre/configs/`** – Stores configuration files for different training settings.

- 🔬 **`experiments/`** – Includes Python scripts for running various pretraining and downstream experiments.

- 🐳 **`Dockerfile`** – Defines the environment for running a local version of SPECTRE inside a container.

## ⚙️ Setting Up the Environment

To get up and running with SPECTRE, simply install our package using pip:

```bash
pip install spectre-fm
```

or install the latest updates directly from GitHub:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/cclaess/SPECTRE.git
```

## 🐳 Building and Using Docker

To facilitate deployment and reproducibility, SPECTRE can be run using **Docker**. This allows you to set up a fully functional environment without manually installing dependencies using your own local copy of spectre.

### **Building the Docker Image**
First, ensure you have **Docker** installed. Then, clone and navigate to the repository to build the image:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cclaess/SPECTRE
cd SPECTRE
docker build -t spectre-fm .
```

### **Running Experiments Inside Docker**
Once the image is built, you can start a container and execute scripts inside it. For example, to run a DINO pretraining experiment:
```bash
docker run --gpus all --rm -v "$(pwd):/mnt" spectre-fm python3 experiments/pretraining/pretrain_dino.py --config_file spectre/configs/dino_default.yaml --output_dir /mnt/outputs/pretraining/dino/
```
- `--gpus all` enables GPU acceleration if available.
- `--rm` removes the container after execution.
- `-v $(pwd):/mnt` mounts the current directory inside the container.
