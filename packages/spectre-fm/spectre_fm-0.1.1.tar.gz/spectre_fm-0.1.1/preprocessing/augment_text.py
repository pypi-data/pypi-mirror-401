Gallbladder: Surgically absent. Common bile duct measures up to 7 mm  in diameter but tapers distally, likely secondary to  postcholecystectomy state.   Spleen: Normal.   Pancreas: Normal.   Adrenal glands: Normal.   Kidneys and ureters: No hydronephrosis. Symmetric nephrograms and  excretion of contrast. Approximately 2.3 cm simple renal cyst noted  in the superior pole of the left kidney, and an approximately 1.3 cm  renal cyst in the left lower pole measuring approximately 26  Hounsfield units.   Gastrointestinal tract: No evidence of bowel obstruction or bowel  wall thickening. Normal caliber appendix.   Peritoneal cavity: Trace fluid in the pelvis likely physiologic. No  evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma.   Bladder: Bladder wall is thickened, likely secondary to  underdistention. There is a focus of air in the bladder.   Uterus and ovaries: An intrauterine device is in place.   Vasculature: Mild atherosclerosis without aneurysm.   Lymph nodes: Normal.   Abdominal wall: Focus of subcutaneous emphysema with surrounding fat  stranding in the anterior abdominal wall.   Musculoskeletal: Marked increase in size of the adductor musculature  in the left proximal thigh due to a large hematoma measuring 7 x 4.7  cm with a small region of hyperdensity/contrast blush (3/400)  centrally within the muscle. The contrast bolus did not persist on  delayed imaging approximately 30 minutes after the initial scan."

This could represent a  small focus of slow, active bleeding which did not continue on  delays, versus pseudoaneurysm. No evidence of retroperitoneal  hematoma."

Focus of air in the  nondependent depended portion of the bladder, likely related to  instrumentation.
