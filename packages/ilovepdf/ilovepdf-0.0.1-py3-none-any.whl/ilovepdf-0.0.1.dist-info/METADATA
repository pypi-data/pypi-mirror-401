iLovePDF API - Python Library
-----------------------------

[![Latest Stable Version](https://pypi.org/project/ilovepdf-python/)](https://pypi.org/project/ilovepdf-python/)
[![License](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/ilovepdf-python.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/ilovepdf-python/)

A library in Python for [iLovePDF API](https://developer.ilovepdf.com)

You can sign up for an iLovePDF account at https://developer.ilovepdf.com

Develop and automate PDF processing tasks like Compress PDF, Merge PDF, Split PDF, convert Office to PDF, PDF to JPG, Images to PDF, add Page Numbers, Rotate PDF, Unlock PDF, stamp a Watermark and Repair PDF. Each one with several settings to get your desired results.

## Requirements

Python 3.9+

## Install

You can install the library via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). Run the following command:

```bash
pip install ilovepdf
```

## Install from source

```bash

virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -U git+https://github.com/ilovepdf/ilovepdf-python.git@main#egg=ilovepdf


```

To use the library, import it in your Python code:

```python
from ilovepdf import Ilovepdf
```

## Environment Variables

The following environment variable can be set to control logging verbosity:

- `PYTHONLOGLEVEL` – Sets the Python logging level (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, `ERROR`, `CRITICAL`). Default is `INFO`.

Example usage:

Set the variable for the current shell session:
```bash
export PYTHONLOGLEVEL=DEBUG
python your_script.py
```

Or set it only for a single command:
```bash
PYTHONLOGLEVEL=DEBUG python your_script.py
```

You can also use it with pytest to see more detailed logs during testing:
```bash
PYTHONLOGLEVEL=DEBUG pytest
```

To see all logs and outputs (including print statements and library outputs) in real time during tests, use:
```bash
PYTHONLOGLEVEL=DEBUG pytest --log-cli-level=DEBUG --capture=no
```

## Getting Started

Simple usage looks like:

```python
from ilovepdf import Ilovepdf

ilovepdf = Ilovepdf('project_public_id','project_secret_key')

```

## Samples

All sample scripts ([see folder](./samples)) are regularly audited for compliance with documentation, naming, comments, and proper usage of API features. Each demonstrates real use cases aligned with integration and unit tests.

## Docker Support

For development and testing in a consistent environment, you can use Docker.

See [.docker/README.md](.docker/README.md) for full instructions.
