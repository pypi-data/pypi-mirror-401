# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Claude-Specific Notes

## Quick Reference

**→ See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for complete SDK documentation**

This file contains Claude-specific notes and references the main agent documentation.

---

## Core Principle

**CRITICAL: NEVER edit `.htmlgraph/` HTML files directly.**

Use the SDK instead:
```python
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent="claude")
sdk.features.complete("feat-62f83856")
```

## Claude-Specific Best Practices

### 1. Use TodoWrite for Task Tracking

Claude Code has a TodoWrite tool for tracking multi-step tasks. Use it when:
- Task requires 3+ distinct steps
- Complex implementation with dependencies
- User provides multiple tasks

### 2. Leverage Read/Edit/Bash Tools

Claude Code provides specialized file tools:
- **Read**: Read file contents
- **Edit**: Make exact string replacements
- **Bash**: Run shell commands
- **Grep**: Search file contents

### 3. Session Tracking

HtmlGraph automatically tracks Claude Code sessions via git hooks. No manual tracking needed.

### 4. Transcript Integration

Claude Code transcripts are automatically linked to features when you work on a git branch:

```bash
# HtmlGraph auto-links transcripts by branch name
htmlgraph transcript auto-link
```

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize SDK:**
   ```python
   from htmlgraph import SDK
   sdk = SDK(agent="claude")
   ```

2. **Check project status:**
   ```python
   print(sdk.summary())
   ```

3. **Get next task:**
   ```python
   task = sdk.next_task(priority="high", auto_claim=True)
   ```

4. **Work on it using SDK** (NEVER edit HTML directly)

## Common Patterns

See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for:
- ✅ Python SDK usage
- ✅ Feature creation and management
- ✅ Query and filtering
- ✅ Batch operations
