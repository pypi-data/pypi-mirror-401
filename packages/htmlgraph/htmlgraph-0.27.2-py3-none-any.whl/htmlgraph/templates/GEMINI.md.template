# {{PROJECT_NAME}} - Gemini-Specific Notes

## Quick Reference

**→ See [AGENTS.md](./AGENTS.md) for complete SDK documentation**

This file contains Gemini-specific notes and references the main agent documentation.

---

## Core Principle

**CRITICAL: NEVER edit `.htmlgraph/` HTML files directly.**

Use the SDK instead:
```python
from htmlgraph import SDK
sdk = SDK(agent="gemini")
sdk.features.complete("feat-62f83856")
```

## Gemini-Specific Best Practices

### 1. Use Code Execution for Testing

Gemini has built-in code execution. Use it to:
- Test SDK operations before committing
- Verify feature status
- Run quick analytics

### 2. Function Calling

Gemini excels at function calling. Leverage this for:
- Structured SDK operations
- Batch updates
- Analytics queries

### 3. Session Management

HtmlGraph tracks Gemini sessions automatically. No manual intervention needed.

## Getting Started

1. **Initialize SDK:**
   ```python
   from htmlgraph import SDK
   sdk = SDK(agent="gemini")
   ```

2. **Check project status:**
   ```python
   print(sdk.summary())
   ```

3. **Get next task:**
   ```python
   task = sdk.next_task(priority="high", auto_claim=True)
   ```

4. **Work on it using SDK** (NEVER edit HTML directly)
