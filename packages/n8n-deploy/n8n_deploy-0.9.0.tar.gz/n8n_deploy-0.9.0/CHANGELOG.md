## [0.9.0] - 2026-01-09

### Added

- **Multi-workflow push/pull support** - Push or pull multiple workflows in a single command
  - `n8n-deploy wf push wf1 wf2 wf3 --remote myserver`
  - `n8n-deploy wf pull wf1 wf2 wf3 --remote myserver`
  - Progress indicators `[1/3]`, `[2/3]`, `[3/3]` for batch operations
  - Summary table showing OK/FAIL status for each workflow
  - Continue processing all workflows even if some fail
  - Exit code 1 if any workflow fails, 0 if all succeed
  - Full backwards compatibility with single workflow usage
- `--non-interactive` flag for `wf pull` to suppress prompts in automation

### Changed

- `--filename` option for `wf pull` only works with single workflow (warning shown if used with multiple)
- Default filenames (`{workflow_id}.json`) used for multi-workflow pulls

## [0.2.0] - 2025-12-08

### Added

- **Folder synchronization system** for managing n8n folders
  - `folder` CLI command group for folder sync operations
  - `FolderSyncManager` for bidirectional folder sync between local and remote
  - `N8nInternalClient` for n8n internal REST API integration
  - `FolderDB` class for folder CRUD operations
  - Database schema v6 with new tables: `n8n_folders`, `folder_mappings`
- **Enhanced CLI verbosity**
  - Global `--verbose`/`-v` flag for HTTP request logging
  - Extended `-vv` verbosity for detailed debugging output
  - New `api/cli/verbose.py` module for verbose output formatting
- HTTP client abstraction layer (`api/workflow/http_client.py`)
- Server resolver for flexible server selection (`api/workflow/server_resolver.py`)
- Shared CLI output formatting utilities (`api/cli/output.py`)
- Accept workflows without `id` field - auto-generates `draft_{uuid}` temporary ID (ND-47)
- Automatic ID replacement with server-assigned ID after first successful push
- Workflow file renaming from `draft_*.json` to `{server_id}.json` on push
- Custom workflow filename support with basename matching (ND-50)

### Changed

- **BREAKING**: `wf remove` command replaced with `wf delete`
- **BREAKING**: Removed `server set-primary` command from server group
