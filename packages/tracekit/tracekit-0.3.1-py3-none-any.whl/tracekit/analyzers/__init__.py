"""TraceKit analyzers module.

Provides signal analysis functionality including:
- Waveform measurements (timing, amplitude)
- Digital signal analysis (edge detection, thresholding, timing, quality)
- Spectral analysis (FFT, PSD, quality metrics)
- Statistical analysis (outliers, correlation, trends)
- Protocol decoding (UART, SPI, I2C, CAN)
- Jitter analysis (RJ, DJ, PJ, DDJ, bathtub curves)
- Eye diagram analysis (height, width, Q-factor)
- Signal integrity (S-parameters, equalization)
