# Status Command

Display comprehensive orchestration system health, running agents, and resource usage.

## Usage

```bash
/status            # Human-readable dashboard
/status --json     # JSON output for scripting
```

## Examples

```bash
/status            # Show system health dashboard
/status --json     # Get JSON status for automation
```

## Information Displayed

### Agent Status

- Currently running agents (from `.claude/agent-registry.json`)
- Recently completed agents (last 10)
- Failed agents requiring attention
- Agent resource usage and runtime

### Context Usage

- Current context usage percentage
- Tokens used vs. available
- Warning threshold status (60%, 65%, 75%)
- Recommendations for optimization

### System Health

- Coordination directory health (`.coordination/`)
- Agent output directory status (`.claude/agent-outputs/`)
- Checkpoint availability
- Stale agent detection
- Lock status (active locks in `.coordination/locks/`)

### Resource Metrics

- Number of completion reports in last 7 days
- Agent output file sizes
- Checkpoint disk usage
- Archive status and cleanup recommendations

## Health Indicators

**Healthy** 🟢

- Context usage < 60%
- No stale agents
- No failed agents
- Checkpoints available

**Warning** 🟡

- Context usage 60-75%
- 1-2 agents running for >30 minutes
- Old completion reports (>7 days)
- Archive cleanup recommended

**Critical** 🔴

- Context usage > 75%
- > 2 agents running concurrently
- Multiple failed agents
- Disk space issues

## Sample Output

```
Orchestration System Status
============================

Agent Status:
  Running:    2 agents (orchestrator, spec_implementer)
  Completed:  15 agents (last 24h)
  Failed:     0 agents

Context Usage:
  Current:    45% (90,000 / 200,000 tokens)
  Status:     🟢 Healthy
  Threshold:  Next warning at 60%

System Health:
  Agent Registry:     ✓ Healthy
  Coordination:       ✓ Healthy
  Checkpoints:        3 available
  Stale Agents:       0 detected
  Active Locks:       0

Recommendations:
  • No action required - system operating normally
```

## Implementation

This command reads:

- `.claude/agent-registry.json` - Agent state
- `.coordination/active_work.json` - Current work
- `.coordination/completed.jsonl` - Completion history
- `.coordination/locks/` - Active coordination locks
- `.claude/agent-outputs/` - Recent outputs
