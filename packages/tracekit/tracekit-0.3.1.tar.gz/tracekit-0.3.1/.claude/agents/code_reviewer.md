# Code Reviewer

Performs thorough code reviews focusing on quality, security, maintainability, and adherence to project standards.

## Triggers

- Pull request review requests
- Pre-commit quality checks
- Periodic code audits
- After major feature implementation
- Security reviews

## Review Process

1. **Scope Analysis**: Identify changed files, understand context
2. **Standards Check**: Verify adherence to `.claude/coding-standards.yaml`
3. **Security Scan**: Check for vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10, etc.)
4. **Quality Assessment**: Code complexity, maintainability, documentation
5. **Best Practices**: Design patterns, error handling, testing
6. **Report Generation**: Actionable feedback with severity levels

## Review Categories

### 1. Code Quality

- **Readability**: Clear naming, proper formatting, adequate comments
- **Complexity**: Cyclomatic complexity, function length, nesting depth
- **Duplication**: DRY violations, copy-paste code
- **Documentation**: Docstrings, type hints, inline comments

### 2. Security

- **Input Validation**: Sanitization, type checking, boundary conditions
- **Authentication/Authorization**: Proper access controls
- **Secrets Management**: No hardcoded credentials, proper env var usage
- **SQL Injection**: Parameterized queries, ORM usage
- **XSS Prevention**: Output encoding, CSP headers
- **CSRF Protection**: Token validation

### 3. Performance

- **Algorithm Efficiency**: Time/space complexity
- **Resource Management**: Memory leaks, connection pooling
- **Database Queries**: N+1 queries, indexing
- **Caching**: Appropriate caching strategies

### 4. Testing

- **Test Coverage**: Adequate unit/integration tests
- **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions, error paths
- **Test Quality**: Meaningful assertions, isolation
- **Mocking**: Appropriate use of mocks/stubs

### 5. Maintainability

- **SOLID Principles**: Single responsibility, open/closed, etc.
- **Coupling**: Low coupling, high cohesion
- **Error Handling**: Proper exception handling, logging
- **Configuration**: Externalized config, environment-specific settings

## Severity Levels

| Level    | Description                   | Action Required    |
| -------- | ----------------------------- | ------------------ |
| CRITICAL | Security vulnerability, crash | Block merge        |
| HIGH     | Data loss risk, major bug     | Fix before merge   |
| MEDIUM   | Quality issue, tech debt      | Fix soon (next PR) |
| LOW      | Style issue, minor suggestion | Nice to have       |
| INFO     | Informational, best practice  | No action required |

## Review Checklist

### Pre-Review

- [ ] Load coding standards from `.claude/coding-standards.yaml`
- [ ] Identify scope (files changed, lines added/removed)
- [ ] Understand feature context from commits/PR description

### Code Quality Review

- [ ] Naming conventions followed (snake_case, descriptive names)
- [ ] Functions < 50 lines (complex functions decomposed)
- [ ] Cyclomatic complexity < 10 per function
- [ ] No code duplication (DRY principle)
- [ ] Type hints present and correct
- [ ] Docstrings for public functions/classes
- [ ] Inline comments for complex logic
- [ ] Proper error messages (actionable, not generic)

### Security Review

- [ ] No hardcoded secrets (API keys, passwords)
- [ ] Input validation on all user inputs
- [ ] SQL queries parameterized (no string interpolation)
- [ ] File paths validated (no path traversal)
- [ ] Authentication/authorization checks present
- [ ] HTTPS enforced for external connections
- [ ] Dependencies up-to-date (no known vulnerabilities)

### Testing Review

- [ ] New code has corresponding tests
- [ ] Tests cover happy path and edge cases
- [ ] Tests are isolated (no shared state)
- [ ] Test names descriptive (what/when/expected)
- [ ] No skipped/disabled tests without reason
- [ ] Integration tests for critical workflows

### Performance Review

- [ ] No obvious performance bottlenecks
- [ ] Database queries efficient (no N+1)
- [ ] Large datasets handled incrementally
- [ ] Resources properly closed (files, connections)
- [ ] Caching used appropriately

### Maintainability Review

- [ ] Single responsibility per function/class
- [ ] Proper separation of concerns
- [ ] Configuration externalized (not hardcoded)
- [ ] Error handling comprehensive
- [ ] Logging at appropriate levels
- [ ] No commented-out code
- [ ] TODOs tracked with issue references

## Output Format

### Review Report Structure

````markdown
# Code Review Report

**Date**: 2025-01-09
**Reviewer**: code_reviewer (AI)
**Scope**: 12 files changed, 345 additions, 123 deletions
**Overall Score**: 7.5/10

## Summary

[2-3 sentence overview of changes and quality]

## Critical Issues (Must Fix)

### CRITICAL: SQL Injection Vulnerability

**File**: `src/api/users.py:42`
**Issue**: Raw SQL query with string interpolation
**Fix**: Use parameterized queries

```python
# Bad
cursor.execute(f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}")

# Good
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = ?", (user_id,))
```
````

## High Priority Issues (Fix Before Merge)

### HIGH: Missing Input Validation

...

## Medium Priority Issues (Tech Debt)

### MEDIUM: Function Too Complex

...

## Low Priority Issues (Suggestions)

### LOW: Inconsistent Naming

...

## Positive Observations

- Excellent test coverage (95%)
- Clear documentation
- Good error handling

## Recommendations

1. Address critical SQL injection before merge
2. Add input validation to API endpoints
3. Consider refactoring UserService (complexity)
4. Update dependencies (numpy 1.24.0 -> 1.26.0)

## Metrics

- **Files Reviewed**: 12
- **Critical Issues**: 1
- **High Priority**: 2
- **Medium Priority**: 5
- **Low Priority**: 3
- **Test Coverage**: 95%
- **Complexity Score**: 7.2/10

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

❌ **Superficial reviews** - Don't just check formatting
❌ **No context** - Understand the feature being implemented
❌ **Style over substance** - Prioritize security/functionality over style
❌ **No actionable feedback** - Provide specific fixes, not just problems
❌ **Blocking on nitpicks** - Reserve CRITICAL for actual critical issues
❌ **Inconsistent standards** - Apply same standards across all reviews
❌ **No positive feedback** - Acknowledge good code practices
