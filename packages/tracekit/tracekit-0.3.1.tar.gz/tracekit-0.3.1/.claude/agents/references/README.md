# Agent Reference Documentation

This directory contains detailed examples and reference documentation for agents.

## Purpose

Agents reference these files for:

- Comprehensive workflow examples
- Best practices and patterns
- Detailed formatting specifications
- Real-world use cases

## Referenced Files

The following files are referenced by agents but are **optional** - agents function without them:

- `git-commit-examples.md` - Referenced by `git_commit_manager.md` (line 175, 230)
  - Comprehensive commit message examples
  - Format specifications and rules
  - Breaking change patterns

- `knowledge_researcher-examples.md` - Referenced by `knowledge_researcher.md` (line 93)
  - 4 comprehensive research workflow examples
  - Source evaluation patterns
  - Citation management examples

- `technical_writer-examples.md` - Referenced by `technical_writer.md` (line 76)
  - 4 comprehensive writing examples
  - Documentation transformation patterns
  - Tutorial creation workflows

## Status

**Current**: These files do not exist yet. They are referenced as "nice to have" documentation but agents work without them.

**Future**: Can be created from the knowledge-base repo or written fresh based on actual usage patterns in this project.

## Alternative

Until these files are created, agents contain inline examples and guidance that is sufficient for operation.
