'''TODO:

+ Enhance RAG with vector search: use chromadb (or duckdb, ...)
+ Split this into multiple endpoints, likely will use Cloudflare Worker for load balancing
+ Test with Ollama cloud LLMs (e.g., gpt-oss-20B)
  + Develop an evaluation pipeline:
    + { TrainingDataset[VariationalParameterSpace, QualitativeDescription] }
  + ...then see how performance holds up with fewer parameters, quantization.
  + ...eventually fine-tuning should happen naturally from this process.
