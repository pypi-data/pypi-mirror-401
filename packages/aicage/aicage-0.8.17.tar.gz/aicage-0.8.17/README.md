# aicage

Run your favorite AI coding agents comfortably in Docker.

## Why use `aicage`?

Agents need deep access (read code, run shells, install deps).
Their built-in safety checks are naturally limited.

Running agents in containers gives a hard boundary - while the experience stays the same.
See [Why cage agents?](#why-cage-agents) for the full rationale.

## Quickstart

- Prerequisites:
  - Docker
  - Python 3.10+ and `pipx`
- Install:
  
  ```bash
  pipx install aicage
  ```
  
- Navigate to your project directory.
- Use one of these commands:

  ```bash
  aicage codex
  aicage copilot
  aicage gemini
  aicage goose
  aicage opencode
  aicage qwen
  ```

## Base images

The first run asks which base image to use; pick Ubuntu or whatever matches your Linux distro.

| Base   | Distro | Notes                                                                                              |
|--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ubuntu | Ubuntu | Good default for most users                                                                        |
| debian | Debian | For Debian users                                                                                   |
| fedora | Fedora | For RedHat/Fedora users                                                                            |
| alpine | Alpine | Minimal footprint; experimental                                                                    |
| node   | Ubuntu | Official Node image (all base images have Node)                                                    |
| act    | Ubuntu | Default runner image from [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) (`act` runs GitHub Actions locally) |

All base images have the same stack of tools installed.

## Agents

Your existing CLI config for each agent is mounted inside the container so you can keep using your
preferences and credentials.

## aicage options

- `--dry-run` prints the composed `docker run` command without executing it.
- `--aicage-entrypoint PATH` mounts a custom entrypoint script to `/usr/local/bin/entrypoint.sh`.
- `--docker` mounts `/run/docker.sock` into the container to enable Docker-in-Docker workflows.
- `--config print` prints the project config path and its contents.

Configuration file formats are documented in [CONFIG.md](CONFIG.md). Extension authoring is documented in
[doc/extensions.md](doc/extensions.md).

## Why cage agents?

AI coding agents read your code, run shells, install packages, and edit files. That power is useful,
but granting it directly on the host expands your risk surface.

Where built-in safety is limited:

- Allow/deny lists only cover known patterns; unexpected commands or attack paths can slip through.
- Some agents work fully only after relaxing their own safety modes, broadening what they can touch.
- “Read-only project” features are software rules. Other projects and files still sit alongside them
  on the same host.

How aicage mitigates this:

- Containers create a hard boundary: the agent can access only what you explicitly mount. Day-to-day
  use stays familiar—just with the host kept out of reach.
