"""
Integration tests for BadgeKeeper auto-renewal functionality.

BadgeKeeper is responsible for automatically renewing badges before
they expire, ensuring continuous agent authentication.

IMPLEMENTATION STATUS: ✅ BadgeKeeper is now implemented in capiscio_sdk.badge_keeper

NOTE: These tests require a running capiscio-core daemon and capiscio-server.
Run with: docker-compose up -d (see docker-compose.yml in this directory)
