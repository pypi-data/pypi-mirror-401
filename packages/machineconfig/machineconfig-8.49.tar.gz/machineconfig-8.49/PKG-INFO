# 🗜 Welcome to **Machineconfig**

Your stack is awesome, but you need a stack manager, to have a tight grip over it, put it together and maintain it.
Entering,  **Machineconfig**, a cli-based cross-platform **Stack Manager** — It is a swiss-army knife; a *Package Manager*, *Configuration Manager*, *Automation Tool*, *Dotfiles Manager*, *Data Solution*, and *Code Manager*, among other functionalities covered, all rolled into one seamless experience, that is consistent across different platforms.


## Workflow:
What is your stack? Say you have a new computer/ VM, how do you go about setting it up with your stack?
Surely, you have:
* A bunch of CLI tools.
* [Optional] A bunch of softwares (GUIs for desktop environment)
* [Public] A bunch of configuration files for your tools.
* [Private] A bunch of secrets, passowords, tokens, credentials etc, etc.
* Data (Both highly sensitive and encrypted less serious unencrypted data)
* Code (your repositories).

Wouldn't be nice if you can set it all up in 2 minutes? This is a hackable tool to get it done.

Consider this concrete scenario: When setting up a new machine, VM, or Docker container, you often face dependency chains like this:

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    A["Need to setup my [dev] environment"] --> B["need my tool x, e.g.: yadm"]
    B --> C["Requires git"]
    C --> D["Requires package manager, e.g. brew"]
    D --> E["Requires curl"]
    E --> F["Requires network setup / system update"]
    F --> G["Requires system configuration access"]
    G --> H["Finally ready to start setup the tool x."]
```

Machineconfig builds on shoulder of giants. A suite of best-in-class stack of projects on github are used, the most starred, active and written in Rust tools are used when possible. The goal is to provide a seamless experience that abstracts away the complexity of setting up and maintaining your digital environment. The goal of machineconfig is to replicate your setup, config, code, data and secrets on any machine, any os, in 5 minutes, using minimal user input. Then, from that point, machineconfig will help you maintain, update, backup and sync your digital life across all your devices, automatically.
