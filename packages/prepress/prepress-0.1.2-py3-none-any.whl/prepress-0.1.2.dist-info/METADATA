# Prepress (`pps`)

A modern, polyglot release management tool for Python, Rust, and Node.js projects.

*prepress is dogfooding its own release management!*

[**View Website**](https://omneity-labs.github.io/prepress/)

## Features
- **Changelog-Centric**: Uses `CHANGELOG.md` as the source of truth.
- **Polyglot**: Supports `pyproject.toml`, `Cargo.toml`, and `package.json`.
- **Trusted Publishing**: Scaffolds GitHub Actions for secure OIDC-based publishing.
- **Safety**: AST-based version injection and robust dry-run previews.
