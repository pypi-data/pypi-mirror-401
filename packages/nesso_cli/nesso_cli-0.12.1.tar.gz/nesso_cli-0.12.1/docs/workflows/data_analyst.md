# Data Analyst workflow

In this document, we describe how a Data Analyst would interact with the `nesso` data platform.

## Components

A Data Analyst interacts with the following `nesso` components:

- BI tool: Superset
- SQL workbench tool: Superset
- Data catalog: Luma
- Exploratory analysis tool: Jupyter Lab
- Data products building tool: `nesso` CLI

## Onboarding

Most of the components of `nesso` are provided as web applications, deployed and hosted as part of the platform. The only exception to this is the data products building tool, `nesso` CLI, which has to be installed on the user's machine. This process is described in detail in the tool's [documentation](../index.md).

## Using data products

## Exploratory analysis

## Creating data products

## Data Analyst vs Data Engineer - responsibilities

Data analysts perform two main actions on `nesso`:

- create data products
- create BI visualizations

## Data governance

## Security
