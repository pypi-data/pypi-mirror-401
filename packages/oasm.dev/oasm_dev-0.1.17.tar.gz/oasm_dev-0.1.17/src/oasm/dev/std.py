"""
Standard Device Configuration Module for RTMQv2

This module defines standard device registers and basic operations
for RTMQv2 development environment. RTMQ (Real-Time Microsystem for Quantum physics)
is a 32-bit SoC framework designed for quantum experiment control and other scenarios
requiring nano-second timing precision.

The framework's design philosophy emphasizes that computation is part of the timing sequence,
with programs running on the RT-Core having well-defined timing characteristics.

Key Components:
- led: LED control port
- rsm: Runtime System Management with basic controls for master, monitor, and timer
- exc: Exception handling with various error types (halt, resume, TCS, division by zero, etc.)
- tim: Timer control port for precise timing operations
- std: Standard device class with core operations (boot, nop, hold, pause, timer, wait)

The RT-Core can directly access two address spaces:
- CSR (Control-Status Register) space: 8-bit address space (256 CSRs maximum)
- TCS (Tightly-Coupled Stack) space: Special memory space similar to windowed GPR space

    Runtime System Management (RSM) class.
    
    This class provides system management controls for runtime operations in the RTMQv2 framework.
    It manages various system-level functions and resources.
    
    Bit Fields:
        master: Master control - enables/disables the master controller (bit 0)
        monitor: Monitor control - enables/disables the monitoring system (bit 1)
        timer: Timer control - enables/disables the timer system (bit 2)
        
    Additional bit fields may be defined in derived classes for specific implementations.

    Exception Handling (EXC) class.
    
    This class provides exception handling functionality for various error conditions
    in the RTMQv2 framework. It allows control of exception states and resumption.
    
    Bit Fields:
        halt: Halt exception - triggers when the system halts (bit 0)
        resume: Resume control - resumes execution after halt (bit 1)
        tcs: TCS exception - triggers on TCS access errors (bit 2)
        byzero: Divide by zero exception - triggers on division by zero operations (bit 3)
        ich: Instruction cache hit exception - monitors instruction cache hits (bit 4)
        dch: Data cache hit exception - monitors data cache hits (bit 5)
        unaligned: Unaligned access exception - triggers on unaligned memory access (bit 6)
        fifo: FIFO exception - triggers on FIFO overflow/underflow conditions (bit 7)
        
    Additional bit fields may be defined in derived classes for specific implementations,
    such as PLL control in the RWG implementation.
