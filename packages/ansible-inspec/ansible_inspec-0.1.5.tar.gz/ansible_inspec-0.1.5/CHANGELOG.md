## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-11

### Fixed
- Invalid Ansible variable names when converting InSpec profiles with special characters in control IDs
  - Added `sanitize_variable_name()` function to convert control IDs to valid Ansible variable names
  - Automatically handles CIS benchmark-style control IDs with spaces, parentheses, dots, and other special characters
  - Example: `"2.2.27 (L1) Ensure..."` → `"inspec_2_2_27_L1_Ensure"`

## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- Detailed test results section in HTML reports with individual control details
- Interactive filter buttons for HTML reports (All/Passed/Failed/Skipped controls)
- Control impact levels and descriptions in HTML output
- Individual test result display with status messages and error details

### Fixed
- HTML reporter now uses JSON internally to properly parse InSpec results
- HTML reports now display all test data instead of empty results

### Improved
- Enhanced HTML report CSS styling for better readability
- JavaScript-based filtering for easy navigation through test results

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- Fixed InSpec Supermarket profile execution requiring git context in current directory
- Cache directory (`~/.inspec/cache`) is now automatically initialized as git repository
- InSpec execution for Supermarket profiles now runs from cache directory with git context
- Eliminates need for manual `git init .` workaround in non-git directories

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-09

### Fixed
- Fixed UnboundLocalError when using `--supermarket` flag with reporters (duplicate `os` import in CLI)
- Fixed graceful KeyboardInterrupt (Ctrl+C) handling - now exits cleanly with code 130
- Fixed InSpec Supermarket profile execution in non-git directories by creating cache directory
- Fixed empty report issue when InSpec fails - now shows proper error messages
- Added `--chef-license=accept-silent` to avoid interactive license prompts

### Improved
- Better InSpec error reporting with return code checking (100=failed tests, 101=skipped)
- Enhanced error messages for debugging InSpec execution failures
- KeyboardInterrupt now preserved through subprocess calls for clean termination

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-09

### Added
- Chef Supermarket integration with `--supermarket` flag for accessing 100+ compliance profiles
- Multi-format reporting support (JSON, HTML, JUnit) with `--reporter` and `--output` flags
- InSpec profile to Ansible collection converter with `convert` command
- InSpec-free mode - converted collections run without InSpec installation
- Comprehensive API documentation (800+ lines)
- Docker Hub overview and publishing workflow
- Quick reference guide for common commands
- Profile conversion guide with examples
- Reporter modes documentation (Native vs InSpec-free)
- Publishing guide for PyPI and Docker Hub
- Blog post template for v0.1.0 release announcement

### Fixed
- `UnboundLocalError` when using `--supermarket` flag with reporters (duplicate os import)
- Docker workflow triggers - added branch trigger for proper tag generation
- Docker environment configuration - added `environment: pypi` for secrets access
- Dockerfile - removed non-existent `bin/` directory copy (setuptools auto-generates)

### Changed
- Updated README.md badges - added Docker Pulls and GitHub Stars badges
- CI/CD workflows - publish workflow now manual trigger only (`workflow_dispatch`)
- Documentation cleanup - removed 6 unused internal docs files (2,183 lines)
- Docker workflow now builds on both branch pushes and tag pushes

### Improved
- Enhanced `ExecutionConfig` with `is_supermarket` and `output_path` parameters
- Added `to_json()`, `to_html()`, `to_junit()`, `save()` methods to `ExecutionResult`
- Multi-reporter support in CLI - can generate multiple formats simultaneously
- InSpec schema v5.22.0 compatibility for JSON reports
- Better error handling and reporting in conversion process

### Documentation
- Created comprehensive Docker Hub overview with examples and use cases
- Added CI/CD integration examples for GitLab CI and GitHub Actions
- Documented popular compliance profiles (CIS benchmarks, DevSec baselines)
- Added volume mount and environment variable documentation
- Enhanced README with feature comparisons and real-world use cases

### Tested
- Verified Supermarket integration with `dev-sec/linux-baseline` profile
- Tested multi-format reporting on remote SSH targets
- Validated profile conversion with custom resources
- Confirmed InSpec-free mode generates InSpec-compatible reports
- Tested Docker multi-architecture builds (linux/amd64, linux/arm64)
