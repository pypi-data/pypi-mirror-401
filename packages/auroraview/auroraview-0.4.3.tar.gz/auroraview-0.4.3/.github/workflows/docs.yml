# Documentation deployment workflow
# - Deploys to GitHub Pages on push to main
# - Builds preview for PRs
# - Auto-generates Python API docs with pdoc
#
# IMPORTANT: Before first deployment, you must enable GitHub Pages in repository settings:
# 1. Go to Settings → Pages
# 2. Under "Build and deployment", select "GitHub Actions" as the source
# This is required because GITHUB_TOKEN doesn't have permission to create Pages sites.
