## Why AuroraView?

### The Problem We're Solving

Game and VFX developers have long struggled with building modern, user-friendly tools for DCC software. Traditional approaches often mean:

- **Outdated UI frameworks** - Qt Designer or native DCC widgets with limited styling options
- **Steep learning curves** - Each DCC has its own UI paradigm and API
- **Poor user experience** - Tools that feel disconnected from modern web applications
- **Slow iteration cycles** - Rebuilding and reloading tools takes too long

### AI-Powered Development Era

We're living in an exciting time where **AI can rapidly generate high-quality frontend code**. Modern AI assistants excel at creating React, Vue, and web interfaces. AuroraView bridges this capability to DCC software:

- **AI-Friendly Architecture** - Our API is designed to be easily understood and generated by AI assistants
- **Modern Web Stack** - Use the same technologies AI excels at (React, Vue, TypeScript, Tailwind)
- **Rapid Prototyping** - Go from idea to working tool in minutes, not days

### Beyond Traditional Tools

AuroraView isn't just another UI framework. It enables entirely new workflows:

| Capability | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| **Browser Extensions** | Build browser-based tools that communicate with DCC software |
| **AI Agent Integration** | Enable AI agents to control and automate DCC applications via MCP protocol |
| **Cross-Platform Tools** | Same codebase works across Maya, Houdini, Blender, and standalone |
| **Real-time Collaboration** | Web technologies enable live collaboration features |

### For the Modern Developer

Whether you're a TD building pipeline tools, an artist creating custom workflows, or a studio developing proprietary solutions, AuroraView empowers you to:

- **Leverage AI** to accelerate development
- **Use familiar web technologies** instead of learning DCC-specific UI frameworks
- **Build beautiful, responsive UIs** that artists actually enjoy using
- **Ship faster** with hot-reload development and easy packaging

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install auroraview

# With Qt support (for Maya, Houdini, Nuke)
pip install auroraview[qt]
```

### Desktop Application

```python
from auroraview import run_desktop

run_desktop(
    title="My App",
    url="http://localhost:3000"
)
```

### Maya Integration

```python
from auroraview import QtWebView
import maya.OpenMayaUI as omui

webview = QtWebView(
    parent=maya_main_window(),
    url="http://localhost:3000",
    width=800,
    height=600
)
webview.show()
```
