# Main Sequence Python SDK


The Main Sequence Python SDK is a high-performance client library that enables seamless integration with the Main Sequence platform. 
It provides a unified and intuitive interface for interacting with data, compute, and intelligence services across the platform.

Main Sequence functions as a centralized engine for data intelligence—integrating information from diverse data sources and systems
while abstracting away the complexity of underlying storage layers. This allows quants, researchers, analysts,
and engineers to focus on the data-generating process itself, while Main Sequence optimizes all CRUD operations and manages 
the mapping between logical data structures and physical storage.

The Main Sequence SDK is also a foundational component of all Main Sequence Platform projects. 
It acts as the backbone for automation, process orchestration, and the rapid development of dashboards,
data nodes, and agentic tools built on top of the platform.

## How the Repository is Organized

The documentation follows the same structure as the SDK. Within each topic, we delve deeper into the logic and usage.

Additionally, we provide an extensive set of examples within the repository here:  
[Example Repository](https://github.com/mainsequence-sdk/mainsequence-sdk/tree/main/mainsequence).

The examples section is organized by use case rather than by individual libraries.

Recordings of our previous bootcamps will be available on our YouTube channel:  
[YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHevDrKbbsoWuV4OjTHOrpA).

### Main Sequence SDK Components

Below are the main modules that compose the Main Sequence SDK, which are importable from `mainsequence`:

1. **TDAG:** A time-series data orchestration and scheduling tool.
2. **Client:** The Main Sequence client for interacting with the Main Sequence API.
3. **VirtualFundBuilder:** A collection of classes and methods to quickly build portfolios and interact with our AI agents.
4. **CLI:** The Main Sequence CLI tool.
5. **Instruments:** An open-source integration of Main Sequence and QuantLib for quantitative finance.
6. **Dashboards:** A collection of scaffolding recipes to integrate Streamlit dashboards with Main Sequence.

### Repository Extra Materials

1. **Examples:** A comprehensive collection of examples demonstrating how to build portfolios and interact with our AI agents.
2. **Docs:** A collection of documentation and tutorials.
3. **Scripts:** A collection of scripts for automating common tasks.
4. **Tests:** Unit tests for the SDK.



## Developing with the Main Sequence SDK & Platform
To make it easy to work on Main Sequence projects from your local environment, you have two options:

1. **Use the MainSequence CLI directly in your terminal**, or  
2. **Use the Main Sequence VS Code extension** (recommended if you already work in VS Code).

The VS Code extension provides a more visual, editor-integrated workflow on top of what the CLI offers.


### Visual Studio Code Extension

1. **Open the Extensions view in VS Code**

   - **macOS:** Press `Cmd` + `Shift` + `X`  
   - **Windows/Linux:** Press `Ctrl` + `Shift` + `X`  
   - Or click the **Extensions** icon in the Activity Bar on the left side of the window.

2. **Search for the extension**

   In the Extensions search box, type Main Sequence and press Enter or install it from here https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=MainSequenceGmbH.vscode-mainsequence

### MainSequence CLI

MainSequence CLI is a small helper tool to:

- Authenticate against the Main Sequence backend
- Manage your local project checkouts (clone, open, delete)
- Set up SSH deploy keys for project repos
- Generate and maintain a `.env` file with project-specific tokens and endpoints
- Build & run your project in Docker (via `uv` + `docker`)
- Bundle and copy AI/LLM instruction markdowns to the clipboard

The CLI is implemented with [Typer](https://typer.tiangolo.com/) and exposes a `mainsequence` command.

## Installation & Invocation

How you install the CLI depends on how this repository is packaged, but assuming it’s installed in your environment and provides the `mainsequence` entry point:

```bash
# General form
mainsequence --help
