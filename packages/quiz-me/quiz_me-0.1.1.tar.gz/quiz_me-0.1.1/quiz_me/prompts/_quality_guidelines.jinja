## Question Quality Guidelines

### General Principles
- Questions should be clear, unambiguous, and test genuine understanding
- Avoid trick questions or overly complex wording
- Language should be accessible to the target audience
- Each question should have one clearly correct answer (for multiple choice)

### Multiple Choice Questions
- All alternatives should be plausible to someone with partial knowledge
- Avoid obviously wrong answers that no one would choose
- Alternatives should have similar length and complexity
- The correct answer should not stand out due to formatting

**Distractor Techniques (for wrong answers):**
1. Common misconceptions - errors people typically make
2. Partial truths - correct in part but incomplete or exaggerated
3. Wrong context - would be correct for a different question
4. Incorrect application - right concept applied incorrectly
5. Cause-effect reversal - swapping cause and consequence

### Open-Ended Questions
- Should prompt genuine reflection, not just recall
- Allow for multiple valid approaches
- The explanation should serve as a rubric for evaluation
- Include key points that a strong answer should cover

### Fill-in-the-Blank Questions
- The blank should test a key concept, not trivial details
- Context before and after the blank should help understanding
- All alternatives should be grammatically correct in the sentence
