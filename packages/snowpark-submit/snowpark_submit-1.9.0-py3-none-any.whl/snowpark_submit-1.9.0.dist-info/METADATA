The snowpark-submit is designed for running non-interactive, batch-oriented Spark workloads directly on Snowflake's infrastructure using familiar Spark semantics. It eliminates the need to manage a dedicated Spark cluster while allowing you to maintain your existing Spark development workflows. This tool is ideal for submitting production-ready Spark applications—such as ETL pipelines, and scheduled data transformations—using a simple CLI interface.
