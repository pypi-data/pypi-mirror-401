Modelling Of Real-fluids Defined by Users

The beginnings of a python package which focuses on the creation and usage of equations of state (EOS) for both pure fluids and mixtures.

For now the package is limited to pure fluids, but will be adding mixture EOS in the future.

The package will allow the user to define their own fluids and equations of state to then calculate fluid thermodynamic properties at a certain state.

Future functionality will include vapour liquid equilibria algorithms and P-x diagram creation.
