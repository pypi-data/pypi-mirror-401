## Overview

**EDMT (Environmental Data Management Toolbox)** is a lightweight Python library designed to make environmental data ingestion, cleaning, transformation, and basic analysis workflows easier and more reproducible. It provides a set of tools and helper functions tailored to the common needs of environmental scientists, data engineers, and analysts working with diverse observational and sensor-derived datasets.

It provides modular tools for:

- Data ingestion (CSV, sensors, exports, logs)
- Cleaning & quality control
- Time-series handling
- Spatial & temporal transformations
- Basic analytics & summaries
- Reusable, reproducible workflows

Why EDMT?

Environmental data workflows often require stitching together formats, checks, and cleaning steps that are repetitive and error-prone. EDMT centralizes these common operations into reusable Python functions and classes, helping you:

- Save development time and reduce duplication
- Standardize procedures across different projects
- Improve reproducibility and traceability of results

## Installation

```bash
pip install edmt
