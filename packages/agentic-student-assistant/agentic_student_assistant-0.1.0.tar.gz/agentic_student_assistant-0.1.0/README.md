## 🌟 Overview

**Agentic Student Assistant** is an intelligent academic companion built with **LangGraph**, **OpenAI**, and modern AI infrastructure. It empowers students and researchers with specialized AI agents for career intelligence, academic research, and curated reading recommendations.

Our toolkit consists of the following intelligent agents:

- **Talk2Jobs**: Real-time global job market intelligence with regional optimization for Germany, USA, Mexico, India, Japan, and more.
- **Talk2Papers**: Multi-tier academic search across ArXiv, Semantic Scholar, CORE, and OpenReview with deep-dive Q&A capabilities.
- **Talk2Books**: Curated reading recommendations from Open Library and Google Books with academic focus.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Advanced Academic Research (Talk2Papers) 📑
A high-fidelity research tool that queries the world's leading academic databases in parallel:
- **Multi-Tier Search**: `ArXiv` + `Semantic Scholar` + `CORE` + `OpenReview.net`
- **Deep-Dive Q&A**: Ask follow-up questions about specific papers' methodology or findings
- **Robust Fallback**: Automatically switches sources if an API is rate-limited or forbidden
- **Semantic Similarity**: Local embedding-based semantic caching for instant similar query responses

### 2. Reading Recommendations (Talk2Books) 📚
Curated reading lists using **Open Library** and **Google Books**:
- **Academic Focus**: Filters for reputable publishers and academic sources
- **Detailed Summaries**: Provides insights into core contributions and target audience

### 3. Global Job Market Intelligence (Talk2Jobs) 💼
Precision search across international regions:
- **Regional Intelligence**: Specific optimizations for **Mexico**, **Germany**, **Japan**, **India**, **USA**, and more
- **Language Aware**: Automatically adjusts search parameters (`hl`, `gl`, `google_domain`) for local results

### 4. Smart Caching System 🧠
Redis-based persistent caching with local semantic similarity:
- **Exact Match**: Hash-based instant retrieval
- **Semantic Match**: SentenceTransformer-powered similarity search (threshold: 0.88)
- **Zero API Cost**: Completely local embedding generation
- **80-90% Latency Reduction**: Through intelligent response caching
