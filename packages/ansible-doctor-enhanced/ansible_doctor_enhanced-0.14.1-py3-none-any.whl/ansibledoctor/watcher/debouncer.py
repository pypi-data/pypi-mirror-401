    Uses threading.Timer to delay function execution until a quiet period

        delay: Delay in seconds before executing callback
        _timer: Active timer instance (or None)

    Example:
        >>> def process_change():

        >>> debouncer = Debouncer(process_change, delay=0.5)
        >>> debouncer.trigger()  # Start timer

        >>> debouncer.trigger()  # Reset timer again
        >>> # ... after 0.5 seconds of quiet ...
