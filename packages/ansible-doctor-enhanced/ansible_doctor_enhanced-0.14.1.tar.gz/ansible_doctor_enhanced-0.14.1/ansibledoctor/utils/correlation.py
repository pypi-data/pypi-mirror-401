"""Correlation ID utilities for tracing operations.

This module provides utilities for generating and managing correlation IDs
that trace execution across nested operations (role → collection → project).
Uses contextvars for thread-safe correlation ID propagation.

Integration with structlog: When set_correlation_id() is called, the correlation_id
is also bound to structlog's context, ensuring it appears in all log entries.
