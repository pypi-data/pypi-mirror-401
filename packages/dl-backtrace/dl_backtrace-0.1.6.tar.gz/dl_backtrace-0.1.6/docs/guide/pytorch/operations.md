## Negative Indexing Support

All dimension-based operations support PyTorch's negative indexing:

```python
# All of these work!
x.transpose(-1, -2)         # Last two dimensions
x.permute([0, -1, -2, 1])   # Mix of positive and negative
x.unsqueeze(-1)             # Add dimension at end
x.slice(dim=-1, ...)        # Slice last dimension
torch.cat([x, y], dim=-1)   # Concatenate on last dimension
```

---

## Operation Categories

### ✅ Fully Supported
Operations that are fully implemented and tested.

### 🔄 In Development

## Custom Operations

### Adding Custom Operations

If you need support for a custom operation, you can:

1. **Request support**: Open an issue on GitHub
2. **Contribute**: Submit a pull request
3. **Workaround**: Decompose into supported operations

---

## Testing Operations

To test if an operation is supported:

```python
from dl_backtrace.pytorch_backtrace import DLBacktrace

# Create simple model using the operation
class TestModel(torch.nn.Module):
    def forward(self, x):
        return your_operation(x)

# Try to trace it
try:
    model = TestModel()
    dlb = DLBacktrace(
        model=model,
        input_for_graph=(dummy_input,)
    )
    print("✅ Operation supported!")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"❌ Operation not supported: {e}")
```
