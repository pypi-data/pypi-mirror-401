## Overview

DLBacktrace is a model-agnostic explainability framework developed by *Lexsi Labs*. It provides comprehensive layer-wise importance values (relevance) and model tracing capabilities across a wide range of model architectures — including Transformers, Large Language Models (LLMs), Mixture-of-Experts (MoEs), and more — as well as diverse task types such as Tabular, Vision, and Text. The framework is designed for robust and efficient execution on both CPU and GPU environments.

## Why DLBacktrace?

### 🔍 **Deep Model Interpretability**
Gain comprehensive insights into your AI models using advanced relevance propagation algorithms. Understand which features and layers contribute most to your model's predictions.

### ⚡ **High Performance**
Optimized execution engine with CUDA acceleration and deterministic tracing. Choose between CPU and GPU execution based on your needs.

### 🏗️ **Architecture Agnostic**
Support for CNN, RNN, Transformer, and custom architectures. Works seamlessly with popular models like ResNet, BERT, LLaMA, and more.

### 🎯 **Multi-Task Support**
Binary/Multi-class classification, segmentation, and text generation - all supported out of the box.

### 🛡️ **Production Ready**
Deterministic execution environment with comprehensive error handling. Battle-tested on real-world models and datasets.

## Quick Example

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from dl_backtrace.pytorch_backtrace import DLBacktrace

# Define your model
class MyModel(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.conv1 = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, 3, padding=1)
        self.relu = nn.ReLU()
        self.pool = nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d(1)
        self.fc = nn.Linear(64, 10)
    
    def forward(self, x):
        x = self.relu(self.conv1(x))
        x = self.pool(x).flatten(1)
        return self.fc(x)

# Initialize model and DLBacktrace
model = MyModel()
x = torch.randn(1, 3, 224, 224)

dlb = DLBacktrace(
    model=model,
    input_for_graph=(x,),
    device="cuda"
)

# Get layer-wise outputs
node_io = dlb.predict(x)

# Calculate relevance propagation
relevance = dlb.evaluation(
    mode="default",
    multiplier=100.0,
    task="multi-class classification"
)

# Visualize the graph
dlb.visualize()
```

## Key Capabilities

### Layer-wise Relevance Propagation
It distributes relevance scores across layers, providing insights into feature importance, information flow, and bias, enabling better model interpretation and validation without external dependencies.

### Graph Tracing & Visualization
Automatically trace your model's computational graph and visualize the architecture with relevance scores. Supports both full graph and top-k relevance visualization.

### Deterministic Execution
Ensures reproducible results across runs with automatic environment configuration.
