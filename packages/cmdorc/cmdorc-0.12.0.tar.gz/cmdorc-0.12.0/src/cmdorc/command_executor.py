"""
CommandExecutor - Abstract interface for command execution backends.

The executor owns the lifecycle of subprocesses/tasks:
- Starting runs
- Monitoring execution
- Capturing output
- Handling timeouts
- Cancelling runs
- Cleanup on shutdown

The executor receives fully resolved commands (ResolvedCommand) and
updates RunResult objects as execution progresses.
