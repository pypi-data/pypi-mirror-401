        An example invalid query is one where the anchor is a sequence number

        [RangeQuery.from_(anchor: StrictNonNegativeInt)][diffusion.features.timeseries.range_query.RangeQuery.from_]

        with a `count` greater than the number of events in the time series),
        and the span is a relative time. Since no timestamp is associated
        with the anchor, the range is meaningless.
