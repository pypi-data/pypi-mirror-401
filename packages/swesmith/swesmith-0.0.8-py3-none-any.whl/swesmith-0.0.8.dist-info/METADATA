<hr />

SWE-smith is a toolkit for training [SWE-agents](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent). You can:
* Turn any Github repository into a [SWE-gym](https://github.com/SWE-Gym/SWE-Gym).
* Create *unlimited* tasks (e.g., file localization, program repair, [SWE-bench](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-bench)) for that repo.
* Train an LM to become a better SWE ([SWE-agent-LM-32B](https://huggingface.co/SWE-bench/SWE-agent-LM-32B)).

## ⚒️ Build Environments
If you're interested in turning a GitHub repository into a SWE-gym, install the package from [source](https://swesmith.com/getting_started/installation/).

> [!TIP]
> SWE-smith requires Docker to create execution environments. SWE-smith was developed and tested on Ubuntu 22.04.4 LTS.
> We do *not* plan on supporting Windows or MacOS.

You can then build a dataset for the repository by...
1. [Creating an environment](https://swesmith.com/guides/env_construction/#create-an-execution-environment)
2. [Synthesizing task instances](https://swesmith.com/guides/create_instances/)
3. [Keep tasks that break 1+ unit tests](https://swesmith.com/guides/harnesses/)
4. [Generating issue text for your tasks](https://swesmith.com/guides/issue_gen/)

## 🏋️ Train SWE-agent's
Training SWE-agent's using the [SWE-smith dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-smith) is super simple.
```python
from swesmith.profiles import registry
from datasets import load_dataset
ds = load_dataset("SWE-bench/SWE-smith", split="train") # Loads all 52k task instances
for task in ds:
    rp = registry.get_from_inst(task)  # Get the RepoProfile for the task
    container = rp.get_container(task) # Returns pointer to a Docker container with the task initialized

    """TODO: Train!"""
```

SWE-smith has been used to
* Fine-tune Qwen 2.5 Coder into SWE-agent-LM-32B (A +32% jump on SWE-bench Verified!) using [SWE-agent](https://github.com/SWE-agent/SWE-agent) [[Tutorial](https://swesmith.com/guides/train_swe_agent/)]
* Perform GRPO style reinforcement learning using [SkyRL](https://github.com/NovaSky-AI/SkyRL)

## 💿 Resources
* [52k Task Instances](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-smith)
* [SWE-agent-LM-32B](https://huggingface.co/SWE-bench/SWE-agent-LM-32B); **40.2%** pass@1 on [SWE-bench Verified](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-bench_Verified)!
* [26k SWE-agent Trajectories](https://huggingface.co/datasets/SWE-bench/SWE-smith-trajectories), including the 5k SWE-agent-LM-32B was trained on.
* [250+ Environments](https://github.com/SWE-bench/SWE-smith-envs), one Docker image per repo represented in SWE-smith.

And there's more coming!
