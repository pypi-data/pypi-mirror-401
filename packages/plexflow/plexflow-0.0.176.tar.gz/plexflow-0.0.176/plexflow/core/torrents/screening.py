        For each of the following torrent release names, indicate whether it is expected to be a bad quality release based solely on the information available in the name. If there are indications of the languages of the release, also include them in the JSON format as a two letter ISO language code. Always answer with the following JSON format:

        {{"torrents": [
            {{"name": "TORRENT_RELEASE_NAME", "bad_quality": "BOOL", "reason": "WHY_IT_IS_BAD_QUALITY_OR_NOT", "languages": ["TWO_LETTER_LANGUAGE_CODES"], "title_match": "TITLE_MATCHES_EXPECTED_TITLE", "season_match": "SEASON_MATCHES_EXPECTED_SEASON", "episode_match": "EPISODE_MATCHES_EXPECTED_EPISODE"}},
        ...
        ]}}

        In determining whether a release is bad quality, you will NEVER consider the following elements:
        - resolution
        - subtitles
        - colorized versions
        - title
        - year
        - release group
        - re-encodes
        - unknown sources

        re-encodes or lower resolutions are still good quality.

        You will only look at the release quality, like CAM, TS, HDTS, WEBSCREENER, ...
