THIS SOFTWARE IS FOR COMPUTATIONAL SIMULATION AND RESEARCH ONLY.

⚠️  IMPORTANT SAFETY NOTICES:

1. SIMULATION ONLY
   - All outputs are computational predictions
   - NOT validated for wet-lab use without extensive testing

2. NO AUTOMATED EXECUTION
   - This software does not interact with laboratory equipment
   - No automated genome editing capabilities
   - Human oversight required for all experiments

3. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE
   - Users must comply with local regulations (NIH Guidelines, etc.)
   - Ethics approval required for human/animal research
   - Export controls may apply in some jurisdictions

4. OFF-TARGET RISKS
   - Computational predictions may miss off-target sites
   - Comprehensive validation required before experiments
   - Consider genome-wide off-target analysis

5. RESPONSIBILITY
   - Users are solely responsible for experimental design
   - Users are solely responsible for safety and ethics compliance
   - Developers assume no liability for misuse

6. INTENDED USE
   - Academic research and education
   - Drug discovery and therapeutics development (pre-clinical)
   - Agricultural biotechnology (with appropriate approval)

7. PROHIBITED USE
   - Human germline editing without IRB approval
   - Bioweapons development
   - Unauthorized environmental release
   - Any use violating local laws or regulations

By using CRISPR-QAI, you acknowledge these terms and agree to use this
software responsibly and ethically.
