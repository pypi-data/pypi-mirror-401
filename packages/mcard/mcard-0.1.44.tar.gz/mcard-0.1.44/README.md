- ⚡ **High Performance**: Optimized test suite (~37s) with runtime caching and session-scoped fixtures.

For the long-form narrative and chapter roadmap, see **[docs/Narrative_Roadmap.md](docs/Narrative_Roadmap.md)**. Architectural philosophy is captured in **[docs/architecture/Monadic_Duality.md](docs/architecture/Monadic_Duality.md)**.

---

## Quick Start (Python)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/xlp0/MCard_TDD.git
cd MCard_TDD
./activate_venv.sh          # installs uv & dependencies
uv run pytest -q -m "not slow"  # run the fast Python test suite
uv run python -m mcard.ptr.cli run chapters/chapter_01_arithmetic/addition.yaml
```

Create and retrieve a card:
```python
from mcard import MCard, default_collection

card = MCard("Hello MCard")
hash_value = default_collection.add(card)
retrieved = default_collection.get(hash_value)
print(retrieved.get_content(as_text=True))
```

### Quick Start (JavaScript / WASM)
See **[mcard-js/README.md](mcard-js/README.md)** for build, testing, and npm publishing instructions for the TypeScript implementation.

### Quick Start (Quantum NLP)
MCard optionally integrates with **[lambeq](https://cqcl.github.io/lambeq/)** for quantum natural language processing using pregroup grammar:

```bash
# Install with Quantum NLP support (requires Python 3.10+)
uv pip install -e ".[qnlp]"

# Parse a sentence into a pregroup grammar diagram
uv run python scripts/lambeq_web.py "John gave Mary a flower"
```

**Example output** (pregroup types):
```
John: n    gave: n.r @ s @ n.l @ n.l    Mary: n    a flower: n
Result: s (grammatically valid sentence)
```

The pregroup diagrams can be compiled to quantum circuits for QNLP experiments.

## Polyglot Runtime Matrix
| Runtime    | Status | Notes |
| ---------- | ------ | ----- |
| Python     | ✅ | Reference implementation, CLM runner |
| JavaScript | ✅ | Node + browser (WASM) + Full RAG Support |
| Rust       | ✅ | High-performance adapter & WASM target |
| C          | ✅ | Low-level runtime integration |
| WASM       | ✅ | Edge and sandbox execution |
| Lean       | ⚙️ | Formal verification pipeline (requires `lean-toolchain`) |
| R          | ✅ | Statistical computing runtime |
| Julia      | ✅ | High-performance scientific computing |

> **⚠️ Lean Configuration**: A `lean-toolchain` file in the project root is **critical**. Without it, `elan` will attempt to resolve/download toolchain metadata on *every invocation*, causing CLM execution to hang or become unbearably slow.

## Platform Vision (December 2025): The Function Economy

Recent theoretical advancements have crystallized the MCard platform into a **universal substrate for the Function Economy**.

### 1. Vau Calculi Foundation: The MVP Card Database as Function Catalog
Using insights from **John Shutt's Vau Calculi**, PCard treats functions as **first-class operatives** cataloged in the MVP Card database.
- **Identity**: Unique SHA-256 hash
- **Naming**: Mutable handles in `handle_registry`
- **Versioning**: Immutable history in `handle_history`

### 2. Symmetric Monoidal Category: Universal Tooling
All DSL runtimes are isomorphic to **Petri Nets** and **Symmetric Monoidal Categories (SMC)**. The **Symmetry Axiom** ($A \otimes B \cong B \otimes A$) guarantees that **one set of tools works for all applications**:
- **O(1) Toolchain**: One debugger, one profiler, one verifier for *all* domains (Finance, Law, Code).
- **Universal Interoperability**: Any CLM can call any other CLM regardless of the underlying runtime (Python, JS, Rust, etc.).

### 3. PKC as Function Engineering Platform
MCard hashes act as **Internet-native URLs for executable functions**.
- **Publish**: Alice (Singapore) creates a function → `sha256:abc...`
- **Resolve**: Bob (New York) resolves `sha256:abc...` → Guaranteed identical function
- **Verify**: Charlie (London) executes with VCard authorization
- **Result**: **$\text{PKC} = \text{GitHub for Executable Functions}$**

## Recent Updates (January 2026)

### Version 0.1.44 / 2.1.24 — January 13, 2026

#### Single Source of Truth Schema Synchronization

Implemented a robust schema synchronization mechanism to ensuring that both the Python and JavaScript runtimes operate on the exact same SQL schema definitions.

**Key Features:**
-   **Synchronization Script**: New `mcard-js/scripts/sync-schemas.js` script copies the canonical `mcard` schema files from the project root to the packaged `mcard-js` distribution.
-   **Distribution Integrity**: The `mcard-js` package now includes the raw SQL schema files (`mcard_schema.sql`, `mcard_vector_schema.sql`) in its `schema/` directory, ensuring that `npm install mcard-js` provides the complete, authoritative schema.
-   **Unified Path Resolution**: Logic in `mcard-js` correctly resolves the schema path whether running in the monorepo dev environment or as an installed dependency.

---

### Version 0.1.41 / 2.1.23 — January 8, 2026


#### CLM REPL Architecture & Bridgelet Universal Vehicle

Completed a major architectural alignment with the [CLM MCard REPL Implementation Specification](docs/architecture/system-design/CLM_MCard_REPL_Implementation.md), formalizing the execution loop and enabling cross-language composition.

**Key Architectures:**

1.  **REPL Loop Formalization**:
    -   Refactored `PTREngine` (Python) and `ContractAction` (JavaScript) to follow a strict **Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPL)** lifecycle.
    -   **Loop Phases**: `_prep` (load artifacts), `_exec` (run concrete), `_post` (verify balanced), `_await` (record history).
    -   **OpenTelemetry Integration**: Added sidecar modules for distributed tracing of REPL phases.

2.  **Profunctor & Coend Semantics**:
    -   Documented `PCard` as a **Strong Profunctor** $[P^{op}, V] \to Set$ and sequential composition as a **Coend**: $\int^{v} (A \to v) \times (v \to B)$.
    -   Updated documentation to reflect Category Theory foundations across both runtimes.

3.  **Bridgelet Universal Vehicle**:
    -   Introduced the **Bridgelet** abstraction for polyglot execution, treating runtime boundaries as bridges crossed by content-addressed MCards.
    -   Enables **JS → Python** and **Python → JS** invocations via a unified `invoke(pcard_hash, input_vcard)` interface.
    -   Ensures **EOS (Experimental-Operational Symmetry)** by passing immutable data hashes instead of raw values.

4.  **Recursive CLM Introspection**:
    -   New introspection modules (`mcard/ptr/clm/introspection.py`, `mcard-js/src/ptr/CLMIntrospection.ts`) for analyzing CLM dependencies.
    -   Features: Hierarchy visualization, cycle detection, and composition type analysis (Sequential vs Parallel).

**New Components:**
-   `mcard/ptr/core/bridgelet.py`: Python Bridgelet implementation
-   `mcard-js/src/ptr/Bridgelet.ts`: JavaScript Bridgelet implementation
-   `mcard/ptr/clm/introspection.py`: Recursive CLM analyzer
-   `mcard-js/src/ptr/CLMIntrospection.ts`: JavaScript CLM analyzer
-   `mcard/ptr/core/observability.py`: OpenTelemetry integration

---


### Version 0.1.42 / 2.1.22 — December 31, 2025

#### Native Static Server Builtin & Unified Runtime Behavior

Implemented a native `static_server` builtin that works consistently across both Python and JavaScript runtimes. This eliminates the need for external deployment scripts and ensures identical behavior regardless of the execution environment.

**Key Features:**

-   **`static_server` Builtin**: Native support for deploying, stopping, and checking the status of HTTP servers directly from CLM.
    -   Uses a shared implementation strategy (managing `python3 -m http.server` processes) to guarantee consistency.
    -   Supports robust port checking (IPv4/IPv6 via `lsof`) and PID file management.
-   **Runtime Inference for Builtins**: CLM files using builtins like `static_server` no longer need to specify `runtime: python` or `runtime: javascript`. The loader now automatically infers the appropriate runtime environment for builtins, simplifying CLM definitions.
-   **Cross-Runtime Parity**: Code duplication was removed by centralizing the `op_static_server` logic, ensuring that `uv run` and `npm run` execute the exact same logic.

---

### Version 0.1.41 / 2.1.21 — December 31, 2025

#### Event Records & Gatekeeper Access Control

Implemented the **Event Record** and **Gatekeeper** patterns across both Python and JavaScript runtimes, completing the VCard integration loop.

**Key Features:**

-   **Event Records (Verification VCards)**: Successful CLM execution now automatically generates a `VerificationVCard`, cryptographically linking the execution result, the source PCard, and the input context. This serves as an immutable "Certificate of Execution".
-   **Gatekeeper Access Control**: `CLMRunner` now enforces the presence of required VCards (via `vcard_manifest` in input) before executing a PCard.
    -   Checks `pcard.can_fire(manifest)` against the Petri Net guard logic.
    -   Throws `SecurityError` if required VCards are missing (when `enforce_gatekeeper: true`).
-   **Cross-Runtime Logic Fixes**: Resolved JSON parsing ambiguities in C, Rust, and WASM runtimes by ensuring input variables appear last in the serialized context, fixing stale state issues from test history.
-   **WASM Support**: Restored full WASM runtime compatibility for arithmetic operations.

**Test Coverage:**
-   **Python**: Verified Gatekeeper enforcement and Event Record generation.
-   **JavaScript**: Validated `createVerificationVCard` and Event Record persistence in `CLMRunner`.
-   **Polyglot**: Confirmed consistent arithmetic results across Python, JS, C, Rust, Lean, and WASM.

---

### Version 0.1.40 / 2.1.20 — December 20, 2025

#### IO Monad Effects for Lambda Calculus

Added observable side-effects to pure lambda computations via the IO Monad pattern, enabling real-time logging of reduction steps without polluting the core logic.

**Key Features:**

-   **IO Effects Configuration**: New `io_effects` section in CLM `concrete_impl` enables console/network logging during lambda normalization.
-   **Step-by-Step Tracing**: `on_step: true` logs each reduction step with hash, term, and timestamp.
-   **Format Options**: `minimal` (single-line), `verbose` (multi-line with box drawing), or `json` output.
-   **Network Output**: Optional webhook endpoint for streaming reduction events to external services.
-   **Toggle Control**: Effects are purely observational—computation results unchanged whether enabled or disabled.

**Configuration Example:**

```yaml
concrete_impl:
  runtime: lambda
  process: normalize
  io_effects:
    enabled: true
    console: true
    on_step: true
    on_complete: true
    format: verbose
```

**New Files:**

-   `mcard/ptr/lambda_calc/io_effects.py` — Python IO effects handler
-   `mcard-js/src/ptr/lambda/IOEffects.ts` — TypeScript IO effects handler
-   `chapters/chapter_00_prologue/io_monad_demo.yaml` — Demo CLM with verbose logging
-   `tests/ptr/test_io_effects.py` — 22 Python tests
-   `mcard-js/tests/ptr/lambda/IOEffects.test.ts` — 22 TypeScript tests

**Documentation:** See [CLM Language Specification Section 7](docs/CLM_Language_Specification.md) for full IO Monad Effects reference.

---

### Version 0.1.39 / 2.1.19 — December 20, 2025

#### Church Numeral Decoding & Meta-Circular CLMs

Added human-readable Church numeral decoding and comprehensive meta-circular programming examples.

**Key Features:**

-   **`church-to-int` Operation**: Decodes Church numerals (λf.λx.f^n(x)) to regular integers for human readability. Returns format: `n (Church: <lambda>)`.
-   **`result_contains` Assertion**: Added substring matching support to Python CLM loader for flexible test assertions.
-   **Meta-Circular CLMs**: Added 4 new CLMs demonstrating self-referential language definition:
    -   `dimension_validator.yaml` - Validates CLM triadic structure using Church booleans
    -   `meta_circular_evaluator.yaml` - SICP-style IF-THEN-ELSE combinator
    -   `combinator_library.yaml` - SKI basis proving Turing completeness (S K K = I)
    -   `fixed_point_combinator.yaml` - Y combinator and recursion theory
-   **Vitest Stability**: Fixed segmentation fault during test cleanup by using `forks` pool isolation for better-sqlite3 native module.

**New CLMs:**

-   `church_decoder.yaml` - Demonstrates Church numeral decoding (0-6, addition, multiplication, successor)
-   `traced_arithmetic.yaml` - Complex arithmetic with IO Monad-like reduction tracing

**Test Results (chapter_09_DSL):**

-   **10 CLMs**, **34 examples** — all passing
-   Python: church_decoder - 5 tests passing
-   JavaScript: church_decoder - 7 tests passing

---

### Version 0.1.38 / 2.1.18 — December 20, 2025

#### CLM v1.1 Specification — JavaScript Runtime Alignment

Aligned the JavaScript (mcard-js) runtime with the CLM v1.1 Specification, ensuring cross-platform consistency for the Architecture of Coherence.

**Key Features:**

-   **CLM v1.1 Structural Keys**: Updated `CLMSpec` interface to support new dimension aliases (`abstract_spec`, `concrete_impl`, `balanced_exp`) and narrative keys (`goal`, `context`, `success_criteria`).
-   **Operation Priority**: `process` and `action` keys are now the primary transformation selectors, with `operation` retained for backward compatibility. Context-provided operations (from test inputs) take precedence over CLM config for test flexibility.
-   **Runtime Defaults**: `runtime` now defaults to `lambda` if not specified; `builtin` auto-detects based on runtime type.
-   **System Built-ins**: Added `check-readiness`, `num-add`, `num-sub`, `num-mul`, `num-div`, and `http-request` operations to the Lambda runtime for environmental and utility operations.
-   **Result Unwrapping**: `LambdaRuntimeResult` objects are now automatically unwrapped to return `prettyPrint` for term-returning operations, simplifying test comparisons.

**Fixes:**

-   Fixed `isNetworkBuiltin`, `isLoaderBuiltin`, and `isHandleBuiltin` to handle boolean `builtin` values correctly.
-   Fixed test case mapping to support `when.arguments` in addition to `when.params` and `when.context`.
-   Updated `expected_output` format in `chapter_00_prologue` CLMs from object (`{prettyPrint: "..."}`) to simple string format.

**Test Results:**

-   **chapter_00_prologue**: 5 CLMs passed, 19 examples passed
-   **chapter_09_DSL**: 10 CLMs passed, 34 examples passed
-   Core CLM unit tests: 14 tests passed

---

### Version 0.1.37 / 2.1.17 — December 20, 2025

#### Stable Seeding Meta-Language & Turing Analogy

Refined the schema documentation to articulate its role as a **stable seeding meta-language** and its computational properties.

**Key Concepts:**
-   **The Unification Thesis**: Leverages cryptographic hashes as universal primitives to unite three distinct namespaces (Content Space, Handle Space, and Version Space) into a single verifiable relational network.
-   **Turing Machine Infinitely Long Tape**: The `card` table emulates the "Infinitely Long Tape" of the Turing Machine formalism. By using relational queries, this tape can be dynamically constructed and traversed for any Domain Specific Language (DSL).
-   **Stability Invariance**: Positioned the schema as an invariant kernel that allows for infinite expansion through data without requiring structural modification.

---

### Version 0.1.36 / 2.1.16 — December 16, 2025

#### Feature Parity & UPTV Alignment

Achieved full feature parity between Python and JavaScript runtimes, aligning with the **Unifying Protocol of Truth Verification (UPTV)**.

**Key Updates:**
-   **VCard & Petri Net Parity**:
    -   Aligned VCard implementation with `vcard://` namespace handles.
    -   Enhanced Petri Net Runner to attach `petriNet` metadata (pcardHash, vcardHash) to execution results for full provenance visibility.
    -   Standardized `success` field and `verification` type in VCards.
-   **Global Time Serialization**: Standardized `GTime` serialization to use UTC (`Z` suffix) across both runtimes for consistent timestamp hashing.
-   **Handle Validation**: Relaxed validation to allow colons (`:`), enabling URI-like handles (e.g., `token:REV-1`) necessary for Petri Net tokens.
-   **Refactoring & Cleanup**:
    -   Consolidated `BinarySignatureDetector` logic in Python and JavaScript for consistent MIME type detection.
    -   Cleaned up `CLMRunner` (Python) to remove unused engine dependencies.
    -   Refactored `FileSystemUtils` (JS) to use the central `ContentTypeInterpreter`.

---

### Version 0.1.35 / 2.1.15 — December 15, 2025

#### JavaScript Loader Fixes & Recursive File Loading

Resolved critical database corruption issues in the JavaScript CLM loader runtime and improved recursive file loading reliability.

**Key Fixes:**
- **Database Corruption Fix**: Fixed `SQLITE_CORRUPT: database disk image is malformed` error in JavaScript loader runtime by ensuring proper database connection handling during recursive CLM execution.
- **Loader Runtime Stability**: Improved `LoaderRuntime` to correctly persist data to the specified `db_path` when running `_load_root.yaml` via the JavaScript CLI.
- **Version Sync**: Synchronized `setup.py` version with `pyproject.toml` (was out of sync at 0.1.25).

---

### Version 0.1.34 / 2.1.14 — December 13, 2025

#### VCard Application Vocabulary — Data-Driven Resource Factory

Refactored the VCard vocabulary to be **fully data-driven** following the Empty Schema principle. All 31 resource types are now defined as pure data in modular extension files (`vcard_ext/`), with a single unified factory (`Resource.create()`).

**New Modular Structure**:
```
mcard/model/vcard_ext/          mcard-js/src/model/vcard_ext/
├── __init__.py                 ├── index.ts
├── core.py    (env, file, dir) ├── core.ts
├── storage.py (5 types)        ├── storage.ts
├── network.py (2 types)        ├── network.ts
├── observability.py (6 types)  ├── observability.ts
└── vendors.py (15 types)       └── vendors.ts
```

**31 Resource Types** across 5 categories:

| Category | Types |
|----------|-------|
| **Core** | `env`, `file`, `directory` |
| **Storage** | `sqlite`, `postgres`, `s3`, `litefs`, `turso` |
| **Network** | `api`, `webhook` |
| **Observability** | `grafana`, `prometheus`, `loki`, `tempo`, `faro`, `otlp` |
| **Vendors** | `google`, `github`, `meta`, `whatsapp`, `telegram`, `line`, `wechat`, `slack`, `trello`, `miro`, `figma`, `linkedin`, `aws`, `azure`, `gcp` |

**Usage** (identical in Python & TypeScript):
```python
from mcard.model.vcard_vocabulary import Resource

# Any resource type via unified factory
ref = Resource.create("github", "xlp0", "MCard_TDD")
ref = Resource.create("slack", "my-workspace", "general")
ref = Resource.create("turso", "my-database", group="us-east")
```

**Code Reduction**:
- Python: `vcard_vocabulary.py` reduced from **922 → 334 lines** (64% reduction)
- TypeScript: `vcard_vocabulary.ts` reduced from **700 → 221 lines** (68% reduction)

---

### Version 0.1.33 / 2.1.13 — December 11, 2025

#### Lean 4.25.2 Support & CLM Test Improvements
- **Lean Runtime Update (JavaScript)**: `LeanRuntime` now uses `elan run leanprover/lean4:v4.25.2` to ensure correct toolchain version regardless of system PATH configuration.
- **Modern Lean Syntax**: Updated `lean_gcd.lean` to use Lean 4.8+ syntax (`termination_by b`, `Nat.pos_of_ne_zero`).
- **CLM Test Case Improvements**: Added missing `test_cases` to `loader_orchestrator.clm` and `then` assertions to `verify_loaders.clm`.

### Version 0.1.32 / 2.1.12 — December 11, 2025

#### Major Modularization Refactoring

**Python Runtime Modules** (`mcard/ptr/core/runtimes/`):
- Extracted `PythonRuntime`, `JavaScriptRuntime`, `BinaryRuntime`, `ScriptRuntime`, `LambdaRuntimeExecutor`, and `RuntimeFactory` into separate modules.
- Reduced `runtime.py` from **~1,400 lines to ~115 lines** (92% reduction).
- New module structure: `base.py`, `python.py`, `javascript.py`, `binary.py`, `script.py`, `lambda_calc.py`, `factory.py`.
- Maintained full backward compatibility via re-exports.

**JavaScript Runtime Modules** (`mcard-js/src/ptr/node/runtimes/`):
- Extracted `JavaScriptRuntime`, `PythonRuntime`, `BinaryRuntime`, `WasmRuntime`, `LeanRuntime`, `LoaderRuntime`, and `RuntimeFactory`.
- Reduced `Runtimes.ts` from **583 lines to 62 lines** (89% reduction).
- New module structure: `base.ts`, `javascript.ts`, `python.ts`, `binary.ts`, `wasm.ts`, `lean.ts`, `loader.ts`, `factory.ts`.

**JavaScript CLM Modules** (`mcard-js/src/ptr/node/clm/`):
- Extracted `CLMLoader`, `CLMRunner`, and multi-runtime consensus logic into modular structure.
- Reduced `CLMRunner.ts` from **863 lines to 55 lines** (94% reduction).
- Handle builtins (`handle_version`, `handle_prune`) moved to `clm/builtins/handle.ts`.
- New module structure: `types.ts`, `utils.ts`, `loader.ts`, `runner.ts`, `multiruntime.ts`, `builtins/`.

**Script Cleanup**:
- Removed 6 redundant scripts from `scripts/` directory (28 → 22 files).
- Consolidated CLM execution into single `run_clms.py` CLI.

**JavaScript Runtime Fix**:
- Fixed variable declaration conflicts in `JavaScriptRuntime` by using IIFE pattern.
- Supports all declaration styles (`var`, `let`, `const`) without conflict.

### Version 0.1.31 / 2.1.11 — December 11, 2025

#### Monadic Core & Lean Verification
- **Schema Split**: Separated intrinsic Monadic Core (`mcard.db`) from extrinsic Vector/Graph data (`mcard_vectors.db`) for cleaner architecture and portability.
- **Lean Toolchain**: Fixed Lean CLM execution hangs by enforcing `lean-toolchain` configuration.
- **Auto-Vector DB**: JavaScript `PersistentIndexer` now automatically derives the sidecar vector DB path from the main collection.

### Version 0.1.30 / 2.1.10 — December 10, 2025

#### Handle Validation Improvements
- **Relaxed Handle Rules**: Handles now support periods (`.`), spaces (` `), and forward slashes (`/`) to accommodate file paths and filenames.
- **Extended Length**: Maximum handle length increased from 63 to 255 characters for better file path compatibility.
- **Cross-Runtime Parity**: Synchronized validation logic between Python (`mcard/model/handle.py`) and JavaScript (`mcard-js/src/model/Handle.ts`).
- **Updated Tests**: All handle validation tests updated across both runtimes to reflect new rules.

#### Loader Return Type Standardization
- **Structured Response**: `load_file_to_collection` now returns `{metrics, results}` instead of a plain array.
- **Metrics Object**: Includes `filesCount`, `directoriesCount`, and `directoryLevels` for better observability.
- **Test Updates**: Updated all loader tests to use `response.metrics.filesCount` and `response.results` array.

#### Python Runtime Wrapper Enhancements
- **Smart Function Invocation**: Python wrapper now tries calling with `context` dict first, then `target`, then no args.
- **Error Discrimination**: Added `_is_arg_error()` helper to distinguish TypeError about function arguments from other TypeErrors (e.g., sorting errors).
- **Proper Scope Resolution**: Fixed entry point lookup using `dir()` and `globals()` instead of `locals()`.
- **Builtin Loader Support**: JavaScript PTR now recognizes `builtin: loader` for Python CLMs.

#### Bug Fixes
- **Reflection Logic Sorting**: Fixed `generate_inventory()` and `weave_narrative()` to handle mixed ID types (int, float, string) during sorting.
- **CLM Loader Detection**: Added support for `builtin: load_files` in addition to existing loader detection methods.

### Session: December 10, 2025 — CLM Execution Refinements

#### CLM Runner & Test Infrastructure
- **Unified Python CLI (`scripts/run_clms.py`)**: Single script to run all CLMs, by directory, or individual files with optional `--context` JSON injection.
- **Fast Test Mode**: Added `@pytest.mark.slow` to Lean-dependent tests; run fast tests with `uv run pytest -m "not slow"` (~20s vs 2+ minutes).
- **Params Interpolation**: Fixed `balanced.test_cases` to properly preserve `when.params` for `${params.xxx}` variable substitution in config.
- **Recursive Interpolation**: Added `_interpolate_recursive()` to NetworkRuntime for nested batch operation configs.

#### Runtime Fixes
- **Unified Execution**: Python and JavaScript runtimes now execute the same set of CLMs with parity in path resolution, context passing, and builtin handling.
- **Python Context Passing**: Fixed `_prepare_argument` to pass context with `operation`/`params` keys to entry point functions—resolves complex arithmetic test failures.
- **JavaScript Path Resolution**: Fixed relative path execution issues in `CLMRunner`; CLMs now correctly resolve recursive calls and legacy formats regardless of execution context.
- **Collection Loader**: Enabled `collection_loader` runtime in JavaScript (`CollectionLoaderRuntime`) and verified with integration tests.
- **Builtin Test Cases**: Builtins (network runtime) now correctly execute `balanced.test_cases` instead of bypassing them.
- **Orchestrator Input Override**: CLMs called via orchestrator with explicit inputs (e.g., `signaling_url`) now skip default test cases.

#### Chapter-Specific Fixes
- **chapter_01_arithmetic**: All 27 CLMs passing across Python and JS runtimes.
- **chapter_07_network**: Fixed `http_fetch.yaml` to use `runtime: network`, enabling cross-platform HTTP execution.
- **chapter_08_P2P**: 13 CLMs passing, 3 skipped (Node.js-only marked as VCard).
  - WebRTC CLMs use `mock://p2p` for standalone testing.
  - Orchestrator overrides `signaling_url` for real connections.
  - Converted `persistence_simulation` and `long_session_simulation` from JavaScript to Python for better stability.

### Previous Updates

#### CLM Test Infrastructure Improvements
- **Execution Timing**: Added timing logs to `run-all-clms.ts` to identify slow CLMs.
- **Floating-Point Tolerance**: Numeric comparisons now use configurable tolerance (1e-6) for floating-point precision.
- **Input Context Handling**: Introduced `__input_content__` key to preserve original `given` values when merging `when` blocks.

#### Runtime Fixes (Prior Sessions)
- **JavaScript Runtime**: Changed `runtime: node` to `runtime: javascript` across CLMs; updated code to use `target` variable.
- **Python Input Parsing**: All Python implementations now handle `bytes`, `str`, and `dict` inputs with robust parsing.
- **Lambda Calculus**: Fixed parser to correctly handle parenthesized applications like `(\\x.x) y`.
- **Orchestrator**: Fixed `run_clm_background` to strip file extensions for proper filter matching.

#### Chapter-Specific Fixes (Prior Sessions)
- **chapter_03_llm**: Replaced LLM-dependent logic with mock implementations for test stability.
- **chapter_05_reflection**: Fixed meta-interpreter and module syntax CLMs.
- **chapter_06_lambda**: Fixed beta reduction and Church numerals parsers.

## Testing

> **Note:** All commands below should be run from the project root (`MCard_TDD/`).

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Python
uv run pytest -q                 # Run all tests
uv run pytest -q -m "not slow"   # Fast tests only
uv run pytest -m "not network"   # Skip LLM/Ollama tests

# JavaScript
npm --prefix mcard-js test -- --run
```

### CLM Verification

Both Python and JavaScript CLM runners support three modes: **all**, **directory**, and **single file**.

#### Python

```bash
# Run all CLMs
uv run python scripts/run_clms.py

# Run by directory
uv run python scripts/run_clms.py chapters/chapter_01_arithmetic
uv run python scripts/run_clms.py chapters/chapter_08_P2P

# Run single file
uv run python scripts/run_clms.py chapters/chapter_01_arithmetic/addition.yaml

# Run with custom context
uv run python scripts/run_clms.py chapters/chapter_08_P2P/generic_session.yaml \
    --context '{"sessionId": "my-session"}'
```

#### JavaScript

```bash
# Run all CLMs
npm --prefix mcard-js run clm:all

# Run by directory/filter
npm --prefix mcard-js run clm:all -- chapter_01_arithmetic
npm --prefix mcard-js run clm:all -- chapters/chapter_08_P2P

# Run single file
npm --prefix mcard-js run demo:clm -- chapters/chapter_01_arithmetic/addition_js.yaml
```

## Future Roadmap

### Road to VCard (Design & Implementation)

Based on the **MVP Cards Design Rationale**, a VCard (Value Card) represents a boundary-enforced value exchange unit that often contains sensitive privacy data (identities, private keys, financial claims). Unlike standard MCards which are designed for public distribution and reproducibility, VCards require strict confidentiality.

**Design Requirements & Rationale:**
1.  **Privacy & Encryption**: VCards cannot be stored in the standard `mcard.db` (which is often shared or public) without encryption. They must be stored in a "physically separate" container or be encrypted at rest.
2.  **Authentication Primitive**: A VCard serves as a specialized "Certificate of Authority" — a precondition for executing sensitive PTR actions.
3.  **Audit Certificates**: Execution of a VCard-authorized action must produce a **VerificationVCard** (Certificate of Execution), which proves the action occurred under authorization. This certificate is also sensitive.
4.  **Unified Schema**: While the storage *location* differs, the *data schema* should remain identical to MCard (content addressable, hash-linked) to reuse the rigorous polynomial logic.

**Proposed Architecture:**
*   **Dual-Database Storage**:
    *   `mcard.db` (Public/Shared): Stores standard MCards, Logic (PCards), and Public Keys.
    *   `vcard.db` (Private/Local): Stores VCards, Encrypted Private Keys, and Verification Certificates.
*   **Execution Flow**:
    `execute(pcard_hash, input, vcard_authorization_hash)`
    1.  **Gatekeeper**: PTR checks if `vcard_authorization_hash` exists in the Private Store (`vcard.db`).
    2.  **Zero-Trust Verify**: Runtime validates the VCard's cryptographic integrity and permissions (Security Polynomial).
    3.  **Execute**: If valid, the PCard logic runs.
    4.  **Certify**: A new `VerificationVCard` is generated, signed, and stored in `vcard.db`, linking the Input, Output, and Authority.

**TODOs:**
- [ ] **Infrastructure**: Implement `PrivateCollection` (wrapper around `vcard.db`) in Python and JavaScript factories.
- [ ] **Encryption Middleware**: Add a transparent encryption layer (e.g., AES-GCM) for the Private Collection to ensure Encryption-at-Rest.
- [ ] **CLI Auth**: Update `run_clms.py` to accept `--auth <vcard_hash>` and mount the private keystore.
- [ ] **Certificate Generation**: Implement the `VerificationVCard` schema and generation logic in `CLMRunner`.

### Logical Model Certification & Functional Deployment

Use of the **Cubical Logic Model (CLM)** as a "Qualified Logical Model" is strictly governed by principles derived from Eelco Dolstra's *The Purely Functional Software Deployment Model* (the theoretical basis of Nix).

A CLM is not merely source code; it is a candidate for certification. It only becomes a **Qualified Logical Model** when it possesses a valid **Certification**, which is a cryptographic proof of successful execution by a specific version of the Polynomial Type Runtime (PTR).

**The Functional Certification Equation:**
$$
Observation = PTR_{vX.Y.Z}(CLM_{Source})
$$
$$
Certification = Sign_{Authority}(Hash(CLM_{Source}) + Hash(PTR_{vX.Y.Z}) + Hash(Observation))
$$

**Parallels to the Nix Model:**
1.  **Hermetic Inputs**: Just as a Nix derivation hashes all inputs (compiler, libs, source), a CLM Certification depends on the exact **PTR Runtime Version** and **CLM Content Hash**. Changing the runtime version invalidates the certificate, requiring re-qualification (re-execution).
2.  **Deterministic Derivation**: The "build" step is the execution of the CLM's verification logic. If the PTR (the builder) is deterministic, the output (VerificationVCard) is reproducible.
3.  **The "Store"**: The `mcard.db` acts as the Nix Store, holding immutable, content-addressed CLMs. The `vcard.db` acts as the binary cache, holding signed Certifications (outputs) that prove a CLM works for a given runtime configuration.

This ensures that a "Qualified CLM" is not just "code that looks right," but **"code that has logically proven itself"** within a specific, physically identifiable execution environment.
