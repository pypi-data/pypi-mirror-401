    Read symbols and associated data from a source Container into a target Container.

    Parameters
    ----------
    container : Container
        The target Container where the symbols and data will be read into.
    load_from : Container
        The source Container from which symbols and data will be read.
    symbols : List[str] | None
        A list of symbol names to read from the source Container. If not provided, all symbols in the source Container

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If a specified symbol in the 'symbols' list does not exist in the source Container.
