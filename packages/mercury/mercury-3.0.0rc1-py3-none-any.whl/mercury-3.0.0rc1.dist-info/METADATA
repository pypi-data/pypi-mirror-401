              "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
              direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
              otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the

              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Mercury 

Mercury is a framework that helps you build interactive web applications directly from Python notebooks. You can build with Mercury data rich applications, like: chats, AI agents, dashboards and reports.

## Why?

Mercury is the easiest way to built and deploy data rich apps with Python. There are no callbacks in the framework. **Widget interactions fire cells re-execution** (reactive notebooks). You don't need to worry about UI because there is **predefined layout**, so it will look beautiful.

## Example - Echo chat bot

Example bot app that will respond with echo:

```python
# import package
import mercury as mr
```

```python
# create Chat widget
chat = mr.Chat()
```

```python
# create chat prompt
prompt = mr.ChatInput()
```

```python
if prompt.value:
    # user message
    user_msg = mr.Message(prompt.value, role="user")
    chat.add(user_msg)

    # assistant message (echo)
    response_msg = mr.Message(
        f"Echo: {prompt.value}",
        role="assistant",
        emoji="🤖",
    )
    chat.add(response_msg)
```

### Live App Preview

Yes, you can preview the app during development.

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mljar/mercury/refs/heads/v3/docs/src/assets/examples/basic-echo-chat.png)

### Production App

You can serve your notebook as standalone web app:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mljar/mercury/refs/heads/v3/docs/src/assets/examples/basic-echo-chat-web-app.png)

## Installation

```
pip install mercury
```

Start server with the following command:

```
mercury
```

It will detect all notebooks in the current directory and serve them as web apps.

Example view of notebooks home page:
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mljar/mercury/refs/heads/v3/docs/src/assets/examples/notebooks-home.png)


What is included:
- collection of **widgets**, so you can build interactive web apps,
- **standalone server**, to serve notebooks as web apps,
- **JupyterLab extension**, to have live app preview during development.

The Mercury live app preview extension is available only for JupyterLab and MLJAR Studio. It will not work in Google Colab and VS Code - sorry guys!

## Deployment

Here is minimal Dockerfile to serve Mercury:
```docker
FROM python:3.12-slim

# Install Mercury
RUN pip install mercury==3.0.0a2

# You can also install needed packages here,
# For example install pandas
# RUN pip install pandas

# Directory where notebooks will be mounted
WORKDIR /workspace

# Mercury default port
EXPOSE 8888

# Start Mercury server
CMD ["mercury", "--ip=0.0.0.0", "--no-browser", "--allow-root"]
```

We also offer **managed cloud** service for 1-click app deployment. Please check our website [platform.mljar.com](https://platform.mljar.com).


## Authentication

You can restrict access to your web apps by setting password when starting server:

```
mercury --pass=your-secret-here
```

Before opening the notebook user needs to provide the password:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mljar/mercury/refs/heads/v3/docs/src/assets/examples/mercury-login.png)

If you want to have user-based authentication in your Mercury. It is paid option. Please reach us for more details contact - at - mljar.com

## Configuration and customization

We want you to customize your web apps so they look and feel exactly the way you like.

To do this, create a file called `config.toml` in the same directory as your notebooks.

```toml
[main]
title = "Mercury"
footer = "MLJAR - next generation of AI tools"
favicon_emoji = "🎉"

[welcome]
header = ""
message = ""
```

### What you can customize

* **`title`** – the title of your web app
* **`footer`** – text shown at the bottom of the page
* **`favicon_emoji`** – emoji shown as the browser tab icon
* **`welcome.header`** – optional welcome header
* **`welcome.message`** – optional welcome message for users

Feel free to change these values and make the app your own.

We are actively working on adding **more customization options**.
If something is missing or you would like to customize more things, please let us know - your feedback really matters to us 🚀

## Arguments

Would you like to see more logs from `mercury`, please use `--log-level=INFO` or `--log-level=DEBUG`. The default log level is `CRITICAL`.

We have option to share the same session between multiple users. What does it mean? You can deploy app, and when you click on it, others will see this. The enable session sharing please use `--keep-session`. Amazing, isn't it?

Would you like to limit your server resources with usage timeout? Please set `--timeout=600`, the timeout value is in seconds. Be generous.

## Previous versions

If you are looking for previous version codebase, the stable v2 codebase is available on the `v2.4.3` tag.

## License

Mercury is licensed under Apache-2.0. See LICENSE for details.

Stay safe! ❤️
