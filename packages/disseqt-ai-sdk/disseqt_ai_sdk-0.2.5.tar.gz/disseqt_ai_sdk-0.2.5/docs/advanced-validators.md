## Agentic Behavior Validators

Agentic behavior validators are designed to evaluate AI agents' performance, including tool usage, goal achievement, and conversation management.

    ],
    agent_responses=["I found the weather information for you."],
    reference_data={"expected_goal": "Get weather information"}
