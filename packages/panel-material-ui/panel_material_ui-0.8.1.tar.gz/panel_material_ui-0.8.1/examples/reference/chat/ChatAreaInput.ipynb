    "##### Core\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`accept`** (str): A comma separated string of file extensions (with dots) or MIME types\n",
    "  that should be accepted for upload. Examples: '.csv,.json,.txt' or\n",
    "  'text/csv,application/json'.\n",
    "* **`actions`** (dict): A dictionary of actions that can be invoked via the speed dial to the\n",
    "  left of input area. The actions should be defined as a dictionary indexed\n",
    "  by the name of the action mapping to values that themselves are dictionaries\n",
    "  containing an icon. Users can define callbacks by registering callbacks using\n",
    "  the on_action method.\n",
    "* **`disabled_enter`** (bool): If True, disables sending the message by pressing the `enter_sends` key.\n",
    "* **`enable_upload`** (bool): If True, enables uploading of files.\n",
    "* **`enter_sends`** (bool): If True, pressing the Enter key sends the message, if False it is sent by pressing the Ctrl-Enter. Defaults to True.\n",
    "* **`value`** (str): The value when the \"Enter\" or \"Ctrl-Enter\" key is pressed. Only to be used with `watch` or `bind` because the `value` resets to `\"\"` after the message is sent; use `value_input` instead to access what's currently available in the text input box.\n",
    "* **`value_input`** (str): The current value updated on every key press.\n",
    "* **`value_uploaded`** (dict): Dictionary containing raw file data keyed by filename after user sends uploads. Each entry contains mime_type, value (bytes), and size\n",
    "* **`pending_uploads`** (list): List of filenames that have been selected for upload but not yet transferred to the server.\n",
    "* **`enter_pressed`** (bool): Event when the Enter/Ctrl+Enter key has been pressed.\n",
    "* **`on_submit`** (callable): Callback to invoke when the send button or enter is pressed; should accept an event and instance as args. If unspecified, the default behavior is to send a Column containing the input text and views. This only affects the user-facing input, and does not affect the `send` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Display\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`auto_grow`** (boolean, default=True): Whether the TextArea should automatically grow in height to fit the content.\n",
    "* **`cols`** (int, default=2): The number of columns in the text input field.\n",
    "* **`disabled`** (boolean, default=False): Whether the widget is editable\n",
    "* **`max_length`** (int, default=50000): Max character length of the input field. Defaults to 50000\n",
    "* **`max_rows`** (int, default=10): The maximum number of rows in the text input field when `auto_grow=True`.\n",
    "* **`name`** (str): The title of the widget\n",
    "* **`placeholder`** (str): A placeholder string displayed when no value is entered\n",
    "* **`rows`** (int, default=2): The number of rows in the text input field.\n",
    "* **`resizable`** (boolean | str, default='both'): Whether the layout is interactively resizable, and if so in which dimensions: `width`, `height`, or `both`.\n",
    "* **`views`** (list): A list of views of the uploaded files.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "* **`sync()`**: Programmatically syncs uploaded files to the server without requiring the user to press Enter or click submit.\n",
