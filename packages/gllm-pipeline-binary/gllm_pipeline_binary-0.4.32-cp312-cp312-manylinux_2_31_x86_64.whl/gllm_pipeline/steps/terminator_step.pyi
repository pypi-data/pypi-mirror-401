class TerminatorStep(BasePipelineStep):
    '''A step that connects previous steps to the END node.

    This step is useful when you want to explicitly terminate a branch or the entire pipeline.
    It has no processing logic and simply acts as a connection point to the END node.

    Example:
    ```python
    pipeline = (
        step_a
        | ConditionalStep(
            name="branch",
            branches={
                "terminate": TerminatorStep("early_end"),
                "continue": step_b
            },
            condition=lambda x: "terminate" if x["should_stop"] else "continue"
        )
        | step_c
    )
    ```

    Attributes:
        name (str): A unique identifier for this pipeline step.
        retry_policy (RetryPolicy | None): Configuration for retry behavior using LangGraph\'s RetryPolicy.

        This method is used by `Pipeline` to manage the pipeline's execution flow.

            graph (StateGraph): The graph to add this step to.
            previous_endpoints (list[str]): The endpoints from previous steps to connect to.
            retry_policy (RetryPolicy | None): Configuration for retry behavior using LangGraph's RetryPolicy.

            list[str]: Empty list as this step has no endpoints (it terminates the flow).
