class AurelioSemanticRouter(BaseRouter):
    """A router that utilizes the Aurelio Labs library to route the input source to the appropriate path.

    The `AurelioSemanticRouter` utilizes the Aurelio Labs library to route a given input source to an appropriate path
    based on the similarity with existing samples. If the determined route is not valid, it defaults to a predefined
    route.

    Attributes:
        route_layer (RouteLayer): The Aurelio Labs route layer that handles the routing logic.
        default_route (str): The default route to be used if the input source is not similar to any of the routes.
        valid_routes (set[str]): A set of valid routes for the router.

    Notes:
        For more information about the Aurelio Labs library, please refer to
        https://github.com/aurelio-labs/semantic-router

        To define the routes, at least one of the `routes` or `index` parameters must be provided.
        When both parameters are provided, the `routes` parameter is ignored.

        Args:
            default_route (str): The default route to be used if the input source is not similar to any of the routes.
            valid_routes (set[str]): A set of valid routes for the router.
            encoder (DenseEncoder): An Aurelio Labs dense encoder to encode the input source and the samples.
                The encoded vectors are used to calculate the similarity between the input source and the samples.
            routes (list[Route] | dict[str, list[str | bytes]] | None, optional): A list of Aurelio Labs Routes
                or a dictionary mapping route names to the list of samples. Ignored if `index` is provided.
                Defaults to None.
            index (BaseAurelioIndex | None, optional): A router index to retrieve the routes.
                If provided, it is prioritized over `routes`. Defaults to None.
            auto_sync (str, optional): The auto-sync mode for the router. Defaults to "local".
            kwargs (Any): Additional keyword arguments to be passed to the Aurelio Labs Route Layer.

        Raises:
            ValueError:
                1. If neither `routes` nor `index` is provided.
