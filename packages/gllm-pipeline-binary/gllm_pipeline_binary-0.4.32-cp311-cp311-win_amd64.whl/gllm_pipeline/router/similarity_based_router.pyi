class SimilarityBasedRouter(BaseRouter):
    """A router that utilizes an embedding model to determine the appropriate route for an input text.

    This class routes a given input text to an appropriate path based on semantic similarity between
    the input text and predefined route examples. It calculates cosine similarity between the input
    text embedding and the embeddings of route examples, then selects the route with the highest
    similarity score above a threshold.

    Attributes:
        em_invoker (BaseEMInvoker): The embedding model invoker to use for vectorization.
        route_examples (dict[str, list[str]]): A mapping of route names to their example texts.
        similarity_threshold (float): The minimum similarity score required for a route to be selected.
        default_route (str): The default route to be used if no route meets the similarity threshold.
        valid_routes (set[str]): A set of valid routes for the router.

        Args:
        em_invoker (BaseEMInvoker): The embedding model invoker to use for vectorization.
        route_examples (dict[str, list[str]]): A mapping of route names to their example texts.
            The keys define the valid routes, and values are example texts for each route.
        default_route (str): The default route to be used if no route meets the similarity threshold.

            Examples: "general", "fallback", "customer_service"
        similarity_threshold (float, optional): The minimum similarity score required for a route to be selected.
            Must be between 0 and 1. This threshold is compared against normalized cosine similarity scores,
            which are derived from the standard cosine similarity (ranging from -1 to 1) and converted to
            a 0-1 range where 0 indicates maximum dissimilarity and 1 indicates maximum similarity.
