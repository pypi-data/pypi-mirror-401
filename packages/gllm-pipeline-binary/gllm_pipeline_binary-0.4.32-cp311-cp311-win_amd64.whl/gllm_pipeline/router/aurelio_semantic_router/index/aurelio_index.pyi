class BaseAurelioIndex(BaseIndex, ABC):
    """An abstract base class for the router index to be loaded by the AurelioSemanticRouter.

    The `BaseAurelioIndex` extends the `BaseIndex` class from the semantic router library.
    It can be used as a base class for a router index implementation that can be used with the assumption that
    the routes are already in the index. Therefore, the index will solely be used for retrieval purposes.

    Attributes:
        sync (bool): Flag to indicate that the index should be synchronized with the routes mapping.
            In this implementation, it's set to `True` by default to make sure that the RouteLayer object initialized
            with this index will perform the syncing process instead of blindly adding the routes to the index.

    Notes:
        To use this class, you need to implement the `get_routes` and `query` methods:
        1. `get_routes`: Retrieve a list of routes and their associated utterances from the index.
        2. `query`: Search the index for the query_vector and return top_k results.
