# py_jama_client

A python Jama Connect REST API client library

## Acknowledgments

This client library is heavily inspired by, and even based on the client library created by the Jama team [py-jama-rest-client](https://github.com/jamasoftware-ps/py-jama-rest-client). However, due to inactivity I have taken it upon myself to create a distinct package for those who have a need for a more comprehensive client -- specifically for the use of embedded resources.

pip install py-jama-client
```

### Usage

#### Basic

```python
from py_jama_client.client import JamaClient # import client
from py_jama_client.apis.abstract_items_api import AbstractItemsAPI # import API

client = JamaClient(
    host="example.jamacloud.com", 
    credentials=("my_username", "my_password"),
) # create client instance

abstract_items_api = AbstractItemsAPI(client) # pass client instance to API

abstract_items = abstract_items_api.get_abstract_items() # use API methods to fetch resources

print(abstract_items.data)
```

#### With Links

```python
from py_jama_client.client import JamaClient # import client
from py_jama_client.apis.items_api import ItemsAPI # import API

client = JamaClient(
    host="example.jamacloud.com", 
    credentials=("my_username", "my_password"),
) # create client instance

items_api = ItemsAPI(client) # pass client instance to API

items = items_api.get_items(
    project_id=82, 
    params={'include': ('data.itemType', 'data.childItemType', )}, 
    # NOTE: 'params' must be a key-word argument
) # use API methods to fetch resources, include itemTypes, and childItemTypes in response

print(items.data, items.linked)
```

### Additional Notes

Please be aware that this package is a work-in-progress, and some API methods may be missing from the source code. Please open an issue, or submit a pull-request (see CONTRIBUTING.md for more).
