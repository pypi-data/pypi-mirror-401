"""This example script demonstrates the implementation of an AXCI-compatible hardware module interface class.

This file demonstrates the process of writing interface classes for custom hardware modules managed by the
ataraxis-micro-controller (AXMC) library and interfaced through the AXCI (this) library. This implementation showcases
one of the many possible interface design patterns. The main advantage of this library, similar to the AXMC, is that
it is designed to work with any class design and layout, as long as it subclasses the base ModuleInterface class and
implements all abstract methods: initialize_remote_assets, terminate_remote_assets, and process_received_data.

For the best learning experience, it is recommended to review this code side-by-side with the implementation of the
companion TestModule class defined in the ataraxis-micro-controller library:
