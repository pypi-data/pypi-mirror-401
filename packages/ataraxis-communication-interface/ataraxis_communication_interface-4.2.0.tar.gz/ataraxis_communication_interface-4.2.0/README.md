## Detailed Description

The library allows interfacing with custom hardware modules controlled by Arduino or Teensy microcontrollers
running the companion [microcontroller library](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller). To do so,
the library defines a shared API that can be integrated into user-defined interfaces by subclassing the (base)
ModuleInterface class. It also provides the MicroControllerInterface class that manages the microcontroller-PC
communication and the MQTTCommunication class that allows exchanging data between local and remote clients over the
MQTT (TCP) protocol.

## Features

- Supports Windows, Linux, and macOS.
- Provides the framework for writing and deploying custom interfaces for the hardware module instances managed
  by the companion [microcontroller library](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller).
- Abstracts communication and microcontroller runtime management via the centralized microcontroller interface class.
- Leverages MQTT protocol to support exchanging data between multiple local and remote clients.
- Uses JIT compilation and LRU caching to optimize the runtime efficiency of all library assets.

[this section](#implementing-custom-module-interfaces) for instructions on how to implement module interface classes.
Note, the example below should be run together with the companion
[microcontroller module](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller#quickstart) example.

### User-Defined Variables
This library is designed to flexibly support many different use patterns. To do so, it intentionally avoids hardcoding
certain metadata variables that allow the PC interface to individuate and address the managed microcontroller and
specific hardware module instances. **Each end user has to manually define these values both for the microcontroller
and the PC.**

Two of these variables, the `module_type` and the `module_id` are used by the (base) **ModuleInterface** class. The
remaining `controller_id` variable is used by the **MicroControllerInterface** class. See the
[companion library's](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-micro-controller#user-defined-variables) ReadMe for more
details about each user-defined metadata variable. Typically, these variables are set in the microcontroller code and
the PC code is adjusted to match the microcontroller code’s state.

### Keepalive
A major runtime safety feature of this library is the support for keepalive messaging. To work as intended, **both the
PC (MicroControllerInterface instance) and the microcontroller (Kernel instance) must be configured to use the same
keepalive interval.**

When enabled, the MicroControllerInterface instance sends a 'keepalive' command at regular intervals, specified by the
`keepalive_interval` initialization argument. If the microcontroller does not receive the command for
**two consecutive interval windows**, it aborts the runtime by resetting the microcontroller’s hardware and software to
the default state and sends an error message to the PC. If the PC does not receive the microcontroller’s acknowledgement
that it has received the keepalive command within **one interval windows from sending the previous command**, it aborts
the communication runtime with an error.

The keepalive functionality is **disabled** (set to 0) by default, but it is recommended to enable it for most use
cases. See the [API documentation for the MicroControllerInterface class](#api-documentation) for more details on
configuring the keepalive messaging.

***Note!*** The appropriate keepalive interval depends on the communication speed and the CPU frequency of the
microcontroller. For a fast microcontroller (teensy4.1) that uses the USB communication interface, an appropriate
keepalive interval is typically measured in milliseconds (100 to 500). For a slower microcontroller (arduino mega) with
a UART communication interface using the baudrate of 115200, the appropriate keepalive interval is typically measured
in seconds (2 to 5).

### Communication
During runtime, all communication with the microcontroller is routed via the MicroControllerInterface instance that
implements the centralized communication and control interface for each microcontroller. To optimize runtime
performance, the communication is managed by a daemonic process running in a separate CPU thread (core).

When the data is sent to the microcontroller, it is first transferred to the communication process, which then transmits
it to the microcontroller. When the data is received from the microcontroller, it is mostly handled by the communication
process, unless the end user implements the logic for routing it to other runtime processes.

### Data Logging
This library relies on the [DataLogger](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-data-structures#datalogger) class to
save all incoming and outgoing messages to disk during PC-microcontroller communication. Each message sent or received
by the PC is serialized and saved as an uncompressed **.npy** file.

The same DataLogger instance as used by the MicroControllerInterface instances may be shared by multiple other Ataraxis
assets that generate log entries, such as [VideoSystem](https://github.com/Sun-Lab-NBB/ataraxis-video-system) classes.
To support using the same logger instance for multiple concurrently active sources,
**each source has to use a unique identifier value (controller id) when sending data to the logger instance**.

**Note!** Currently, only the MicroControllerInterface supports logging the data to disk.

#### Log Format
Each message is logged as a one-dimensional numpy uint8 array, saved as an .npy file. Inside the array, the data is
organized in the following order:
1. The uint8 id of the data source (microcontroller). The ID occupies the first byte of each log entry.
2. The uint64 timestamp that specifies the number of microseconds elapsed since the acquisition of the **onset**
   timestamp (see below). The timestamp occupies **8** bytes following the ID byte. This value communicates when each
   message was sent or received by the PC.
3. The serialized message payload sent to the microcontroller or received from the microcontroller. The payload can
   be deserialized using the appropriate message structure. The payload occupies all remaining bytes, following the
   source ID and the timestamp.

#### Onset timestamp:
Each MicroControllerInterface generates an `onset` timestamp as part of its `start()` method runtime. This log entry
uses a modified data order and stores the current UTC time, accurate to microseconds, as the total number of
microseconds elapsed since the UTC epoch onset. All further log entries for the same source use the timestamp section
of their payloads to communicate the number of microseconds elapsed since the onset timestamp acquisition.

The onset log entry uses the following data organization order:
1. The uint8 id of the data source (microcontroller).
2. The uint64 value **0** that occupies 8 bytes following the source id. A 'timestamp' value of 0 universally indicates
   that the log entry stores the onset timestamp.
3. The uint64 value that stores the number of microseconds elapsed since the UTC epoch onset. This value specifies the
   current time when the onset timestamp was generated.

#### Working with MicroControllerInterface Logs

See the [quickstart](#quickstart) example above for a demonstration on how to assemble and parse the message
log archives generated by the MicroControllerInterface instance at runtime.

**Note!** Currently, the log parsing function only works with messages that use event-codes greater than 50 and only
with messages sent by custom hardware module instances. The only exception to this rule is the **Command Completion**
events (event code 2), which are also parsed for each hardware module.

The logged data is packaged into a hierarchical structure the segments messages by each custom hardware module instance,
packing each in the **ExtractedModuleData** dataclass instances. Each instance further segments the data into 'events'
by storing extracted data in a dictionary that uses event-codes as keys and tuples of **ExtractedMessageData** instances
as values. Each **ExtractedMessageData** stores the data of a single message received from the respective hardware
module during runtime.

### Custom Module Interfaces
For this library, an interface is a class that contains the logic for sending the command and parameter data to the
hardware module and receiving and processing the data sent by the module to the PC. The microcontroller and PC libraries
ensure that the data is efficiently moved between the module and the interface and saved (logged) to disk. The rest of
the module-interface interaction is up to the end user (module / interface developer).

### Implementing Custom Module Interfaces
All module interfaces intended to be accessible through this library have to follow the implementation guidelines
described in the [example module interface implementation file](./examples/example_interface.py). Specifically,
**all custom module interfaces have to subclass the ModuleInterface class from this library and implement all abstract
methods**.

#### Abstract Methods
These methods provide the inherited API used by the centralized microcontroller interface to connect hardware module
interfaces to their hardware modules managed by the companion microcontroller. Specifically, the
MicroControllerInterface calls these methods as part of the remote communication process’s runtime cycle to work with
the data sent by the custom hardware module.

#### initialize_remote_assets
This method is called by the MicroControllerInterface once for each ModuleInterface at the beginning of the
communication cycle. The method should be used to initialize or configure custom assets (queues, shared memory buffers,
timers, etc.) that need to be processed from the (remote) communication process.
```python
def initialize_remote_assets(self) -> None:
    # Connects to the shared memory array from the remote process.
    self._shared_memory.connect()
```

#### terminate_remote_assets
This method is the inverse of the initialize_remote_assets() method. It is called by the MicroControllerInterface for
each ModuleInterface at the end of the communication cycle. This method should be used to clean up (terminate) any
assets initialized at the beginning of the communication runtime to ensure all resources are released before the process
is terminated.
```python
def terminate_remote_assets(self) -> None:
    # The shared memory array must be manually disconnected from each process that uses it to prevent runtime
    # errors.
    self._shared_memory.disconnect()
```

#### process_received_data
This method allows processing incoming module messages as they are received by the PC. The MicroControllerInterface
instance calls this method for any ModuleState or ModuleData message received from the hardware module, if the
event code of the message matches one of the codes in the data_codes attribute of the module’s interface instance.

**Note!** The MicroControllerInterface class ***automatically*** saves (logs) each received and sent message to disk.
Therefore, this method should ***not*** be used to save the data for post-runtime processing. Instead, this method
should be used to process the data in real time or route it to other processes / machines for real time processing.

Since all ModuleInterfaces used by the same MicroControllerInterface share the communication process,
**process_received_data() should not use complex logic or processing**. Treat this method as a hardware interrupt
function: its main goal is to handle the incoming data as quickly as possible and allow the communication loop to run
for other modules.

This example demonstrates the implementation of the processing method to send the data back to the main process:
```python
from ataraxis_communication_interface import ModuleData, ModuleState

def process_received_data(self, message: ModuleData | ModuleState) -> None:
    # Event codes 52 and 53 are used to communicate the current state of the output pin managed by the example
    # module. State messages transmit these event-codes, so there is no additional data to parse other than
    # event codes.
    if message.event == 52 or message.event == 53:
        # Code 52 indicates that the pin outputs a HIGH signal, code 53 indicates the pin outputs a LOW signal.
        # If the pin state has changed from HIGH (52) to LOW (53), increments the pulse count stored in the shared
        # memory array.
        if message.event == 53 and self._previous_pin_state:
            self._shared_memory[0] += 1

        # Sets the previous pin state value to match the recorded pin state.
        self._previous_pin_state = True if message.event == 52 else False

    # The module uses code 54 messages to return its echo value to the PC.
    elif isinstance(message, ModuleData) and message.event == 54:
        # The echo value is transmitted by a Data message. In addition to the event code, Data messages include a
        # data_object. Upon reception, the data object is automatically deserialized into the appropriate
        # Python object, so it can be accessed directly.
        self._shared_memory[2] = message.data_object  # Records the received data value to the shared memory.
        self._shared_memory[1] += 1  # Increments the received echo value count.
```

#### Sending Data to the Microcontroller
In addition to abstract methods, each interface may need to send data to the microcontroller. Broadly, the outgoing
messages are divided into two categories: **commands** and **parameter updates**. Command messages instruct the module
to perform a specified action. Parameter updates are used to overwrite the module’s runtime parameters to broadly adjust
how the module behaves while executing commands.

Each interface should use the `send_parameters()` method inherited from the (base) ModuleInterface class to send
parameter update messages to the managed module and the `send_command()` method to send command messages to the managed
module. These utility method abstracts the necessary steps for packaging and transmitting the input data to the module.

**Note!** These methods use LRU caching and JIT compilation to optimize their runtime speed and minimize the delay
between submitting the message for transmission and it being sent to the microcontroller. Therefore, most command and
parameter update functions / methods should be simple wrappers around these inherited methods. See the API documentation
for the ModuleInterface class for the details about these methods inherited by each child interface class.

### Development Automation

This project comes with a fully configured set of automation pipelines implemented using
[tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/user_guide.html). Check the [tox.ini file](tox.ini) for details about the
available pipelines and their implementation. Alternatively, call ```tox list``` from the root directory of the project
to see the list of available tasks.

**Note!** All pull requests for this project have to successfully complete the ```tox``` task before being merged.
To expedite the task’s runtime, use the ```tox --parallel``` command to run some tasks in-parallel.

### Automation Troubleshooting

Many packages used in 'tox' automation pipelines (uv, mypy, ruff) and 'tox' itself may experience runtime failures. In
most cases, this is related to their caching behavior. If an unintelligible error is encountered with
any of the automation components, deleting the corresponding .cache (.tox, .ruff_cache, .mypy_cache, etc.) manually
or via a CLI command typically solves the issue.
