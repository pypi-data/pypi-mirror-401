# MultiRandom 🎲

A comprehensive library for exploring and generating randomness across the spectrum—from true physical entropy to mathematical pseudo-randomness and everything in between.

## 🌟 Overview

MultiRandom is designed for developers, researchers, and hobbyists who want to understand high-quality randomness. It provides tools to fetch random data from quantum sources, physical human interaction, and modern mathematical algorithms.

> [!WARNING]
> **Security Note**: This library contains both "True" and "Pseudo" random sources. While some sources (like QRNG) are highly secure, others (like LCGs) are provided for educational purposes and include **reverse logic** to demonstrate their insecurity. Always use the appropriate generator for your use case.

## 🛠 Features & Usage

### 1. Human-in-the-loop Entropy (`true_rand`)
Uses `pyautogui` and Windows API to capture sub-microsecond timing jitter and spatial coordinates from physical mouse clicks.

```python
from true_rand.rand_via_clicks import MultiRandomUsingBetweenMixedClicks

# Requires a sequence of Left -> Right -> Middle clicks to seed
gen = MultiRandomUsingBetweenMixedClicks()
print(gen.random())
```

### 2. Quantum & Hardware APIs (`true_rand`)
Fetch "True" randomness from remote physical processes.

- **Australian National University (ANU)**: Quantum vacuum noise.
- **Random.org**: Atmospheric noise.
- **Roll-API**: Physical dice rolling hardware.

### 3. Bit-Shift Generators (`virt_rand`)
Implementations of the most popular mathematical generators used in modern systems.

- **Original XorShift**: Includes `reverse_roll()` to demonstrate mathematical reversibility.
- **Scrambled Variants**: Xorwow (CUDA), Xorshift+ (V8/Webkit).
- **Modern Xoshiro**: Xoshiro256**, Xoroshiro128++ (Minecraft Java 1.18+).

### 4. Mathematical LCGs (`virt_rand`)
Classic Linear Congruential Generators with customizable shift parameters. Ideal for understanding how modular arithmetic creates pseudo-random patterns.
