MultiBgolearn is a Python package designed for multi-objective Bayesian global optimization (MOBO), specifically tailored for materials design. It extends the functionalities of the Bgolearn package, which focuses on single-objective optimization, by enabling the simultaneous optimization of multiple material properties. This makes MultiBgolearn highly suitable for real-world applications where trade-offs between competing objectives are common.

The repository provides the source code of the MultiBgolearn package along with several multi-objective Bayesian global optimization (MOBO) algorithms.
