<h3><p align="center">
   <b>Automated Exploratory Data Analysis</b>
</p></h3>

<p align="center">
  Cognia is a Python library that automatically performs
  <b>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)</b> and generates a
  structured, insight-rich <b>HTML report</b>.
</p>

<p align="center">
  Instead of writing repetitive and error-prone EDA scripts,
  <b>Cognia thinks like a data analyst</b> and delivers clear insights,
  visualizations, and warnings instantly.
</p>


## ✨ Why Cognia?

Before building:

- Machine Learning models
- Statistical analyses
- Dashboards or business insights

You must understand your data.

However, traditional EDA is often:

❌ Time-consuming

❌ Repetitive

❌ Hard to standardize

❌ Difficult to scale

### 👉 Cognia automates this entire process.
