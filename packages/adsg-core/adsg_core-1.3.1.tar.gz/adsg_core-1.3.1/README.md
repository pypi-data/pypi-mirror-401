The Design Space Graph (DSG) allows you to model design spaces using a directed graph that contains three
types of architectural choices:

- Selection choices (see example below): selecting among mutually-exclusive options, used for *selecting* which nodes
  are part of an architecture instance
- Connection choices: connecting one or more source nodes to one or more target nodes, subject to connection constraints
  and optional node existence (due to selection choices)
- Additional design variables: continuous or discrete, subject to optional existence (due to selection choices)

![DSG with selection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbussemaker/adsg-core/main/docs/figures/adsg_ex_sel.svg)

Modeling a design space like this allows you to:

- Model hierarchical relationships between choices, for example only activating a choice when another choice has some
  option selected, or restricting the available options for choices based on higher-up choices
- Formulate the design space as an optimization problem that can be solved using numerical optimization algorithms
- Generate architecture instances for a given design vector, automatically correct incorrect design variables, and get
  information about which design variables were active
- Implement an evaluation function (architecture instance --> metrics) and run the optimization problem

*Note: due to historical reasons the package and code refer to the ADSG (Architecture DSG), because originally it had
been developed to model system architecture design spaces. In the context of this library, the ADSG and DSG can be
considered to be equivalent.*

## Installation

First, create a conda environment (skip if you already have one):
```
conda create --name dsg python=3.12
conda activate dsg
```

Then install the package:
```
conda install numpy scipy~=1.9
pip install adsg-core
```

Optionally also install optimization algorithms ([SBArchOpt](sbarchopt.readthedocs.io/)):
```
pip install adsg-core[opt]
```

If you want to interact with the DSG from a [Jupyter notebook](https://jupyter.org/):
```
pip install adsg-core[nb]
jupyter notebook
```

## Documentation

Refer to the [documentation](https://adsg-core.readthedocs.io/) for more background on the DSG
and how to implement architecture optimization problems.
