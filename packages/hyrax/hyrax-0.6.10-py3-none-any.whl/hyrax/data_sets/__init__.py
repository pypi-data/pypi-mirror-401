Hyrax has several built-in datasets that you can use for astronomical data. For many uses, these datasets
can be configured out-of-the box for a given project.

:doc:`FitsImageDataSet <fits_image_dataset/index>` is a generic container for fits image cutout data
indexed by a user-provided catalog file. It attempts to cover common usage paradigms such as multiple images
of the same object differentiated by telescope filter; however, extending the class as a custom dataset
may be more well fit to advanced usage.

:doc:`LSSTDataset <lsst_dataset/index>` Is a alpha-quality container for LSST cutout images, currently
limited to ``deep_coadd`` type images, and restricted to run only on a Rubin observatory RSP environment
where `LSST Pipeline <https://pipelines.lsst.io/>`_ tools and a
`data butler <https://pipelines.lsst.io/modules/lsst.daf.butler/index.html>`_ with the appropriate images
are available.

:doc:`DownloadedLSSTDataset <downloaded_lsst_dataset/index>` is a subclass of LSSTDataset that generates
cutouts from the butler and saves them as ``.pt`` files on first access. On subsequent access,
it loads the cutouts directly from these files, which can significantly speed up data loading times.
It inherits from LSSTDataset to access the data butler and catalog functionality.

:doc:`HSCDataSet <hsc_data_set/index>` Works similarly to FitsImageDataSet, but is specialized to
`Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) <https://hsc-release.mtk.nao.ac.jp/doc/index.php/data/>`_ cutout images downloaded
with the hyrax ``download`` verb. It contains additional integrity checks and is tightly integrated with
the ``download`` and ``rebuild_manifest`` verbs. In future this class and the downloader may become a
separate package.

:doc:`HyraxCifarDataset <hyrax_cifar_dataset/index>` and
:doc:`HyraxCifarIterableDataset <hyrax_cifar_dataset/index>` give access to the standard
`CIFAR10 <https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html>`_ labeled image dataset, automatically downloading the
dataset if it is not present. These datasets are useful for testing hyrax and occasionally individual models,
but they are not astronomical datasets.

:doc:`HyraxRandomDataset <random/hyrax_random_dataset/index>` and
:doc:`HyraxRandomIterableDataset <random/hyrax_random_dataset/index>` are utility datasets that
generate random data with a specific shape.
These datasets make it easy to test new models with simple random data.
They are highly configurable such that it's possible to simulate input data for models that
are under development.

Each of these datasets can be used a starting point for a Custom Dataset by inheriting your custom dataset
from e.g. `FitsImageDataSet`, or you can make an entirely custom dataset following the
:ref:`custom dataset instructions <custom-dataset-instructions>` and/or
:doc:`custom dataset example notebook </pre_executed/custom_dataset>`.

The remaining classes in this module exist primarily for Hyrax interface purposes:

:doc:`InferenceDataset <inference_dataset/index>` is a dataset class that represents an ``infer`` or ``umap``
result, and may be returned from those verbs to provide data access

:doc:`HyraxDataset <data_set_registry/index>` is a base class for all datasets in Hyrax and must be within
the inheretence hierarchy of all custom datasets. It is not usable on it's own, but provides various fall-back
functionality to make custom datasets easier to write. See the
:ref:`custom dataset instructions <custom-dataset-instructions>` and
:doc:`example notebook </pre_executed/custom_dataset>` for more information.
