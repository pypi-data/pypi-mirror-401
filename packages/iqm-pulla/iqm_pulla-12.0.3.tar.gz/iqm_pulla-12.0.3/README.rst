IQM Pulla
#########

Pulla (pulse-level access) is a client-side software which allows the user to control the generation and
execution of pulse schedules on a quantum computer. Within the existing IQM QCCSW stack, Pulla is somewhere between
circuit-level execution and EXA-experiment.

An interactive user guide is available as a Jupyter notebook in the `docs` folder.

Use
===

Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    conda create -y -n pulla python=3.11 pip=23.0
    conda activate pulla
    pip install iqm-pulla[notebook, qiskit, qir]

The ``[qiskit]`` option is to enable Qiskit-related features and utilities, like converting Qiskit circuits to Pulla circuits, constructing a compatible compiler instance, or constructing a ``PullaBackend`` for running Qiskit jobs.

The ``[qir]`` option is to enable QIR support, e.g. the ``qir_to_pulla`` function.

The ``[notebook]`` option is to be able to run the example notebooks, using
and run it in Jupyter Notebook:

.. code-block:: bash

    jupyter-notebook

Development
===========

Install development and testing dependencies:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -e ".[dev,notebook,qiskit,qir,testing,docs]"

e2e testing is execution of all user guides (Jupyter notebooks). User guides cover the majority of user-level features,
so we achieve two things: end-to-end-test Pulla as a client library, and make sure the user guides are correct.
(Server-side use of Pulla is e2e-tested as part of CoCoS.)

You have to provide IQM Server URL as environment variable:

.. code-block:: bash

    IQM_SERVER_URL=<IQM_SERVER_URL> tox -e e2e

Notebooks are executed using `jupyter execute` command. It does not print any output if there are no errors. If you want
to run a particular notebook and see the output cells printed in the terminal, you can use ``nbconvert`` with ``jq``
(https://jqlang.github.io/jq/download/) like so:

.. code-block:: bash

    jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute  docs/Quick\ Start.ipynb --stdout | jq -r '.cells[] | select(.outputs) | .outputs[] | select(.output_type == "stream") | .text[]'

Run unit tests, build docs, build package:

.. code-block:: bash

    tox
    tox -e docs
    tox -e build
