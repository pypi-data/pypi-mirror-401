              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a

              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,

           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# OpenSandbox Code Interpreter SDK for Python

English | [中文](README_zh.md)

A Python SDK for executing code in secure, isolated sandboxes. It provides a high-level API for running Python, Java,
Go, TypeScript, and other languages safely, with support for code execution contexts.

## Prerequisites

This SDK requires a Docker image containing the Code Interpreter runtime environment. You must use the
`opensandbox/code-interpreter` image (or a derivative) which includes pre-installed runtimes for Python, Java, Go,
Node.js, etc.

For detailed information about supported languages and versions, refer to the
[Environment Documentation](../../../sandboxes/code-interpreter/README.md).

## Installation

### pip

```bash
pip install opensandbox-code-interpreter
```

### uv

```bash
uv add opensandbox-code-interpreter
```

## Quick Start

The following example demonstrates how to create a sandbox with a specific runtime configuration and execute a simple
script.

```python
import asyncio
from datetime import timedelta

from code_interpreter import CodeInterpreter, SupportedLanguage
from opensandbox import Sandbox
from opensandbox.config import ConnectionConfig


async def main() -> None:
    # 1. Configure connection
    config = ConnectionConfig(
        domain="api.opensandbox.io",
        api_key="your-api-key",
        request_timeout=timedelta(seconds=60),
    )

    # 2. Create a Sandbox with the code-interpreter image + runtime versions
    sandbox = await Sandbox.create(
        "opensandbox/code-interpreter:latest",
        connection_config=config,
        entrypoint=["/opt/opensandbox/code-interpreter.sh"],
        env={
            "PYTHON_VERSION": "3.11",
            "JAVA_VERSION": "17",
            "NODE_VERSION": "20",
            "GO_VERSION": "1.24",
        },
    )

    # 3. Use async context manager to ensure local resources are cleaned up
    async with sandbox:
        # 4. Create CodeInterpreter wrapper
        interpreter = await CodeInterpreter.create(sandbox=sandbox)

        # 5. Create an execution context (Python)
        context = await interpreter.codes.create_context(SupportedLanguage.PYTHON)

        # 6. Run code
        result = await interpreter.codes.run(
            "import sys\nprint(sys.version)\nresult = 2 + 2\nresult",
            context=context,
        )

        # Alternatively, you can pass a language directly (recommended: SupportedLanguage.*).
        # This uses the default context for that language (state can persist across runs).
        # result = await interpreter.codes.run("print('hi')", language=SupportedLanguage.PYTHON)

        # 7. Print output
        if result.result:
            print(result.result[0].text)

        # 8. Cleanup remote instance (optional but recommended)
        await sandbox.kill()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    asyncio.run(main())
```

### Synchronous Quick Start

If you prefer a synchronous API, use `SandboxSync` + `CodeInterpreterSync`:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

import httpx
from code_interpreter import CodeInterpreterSync
from opensandbox import SandboxSync
from opensandbox.config import ConnectionConfigSync

config = ConnectionConfigSync(
    domain="api.opensandbox.io",
    api_key="your-api-key",
    request_timeout=timedelta(seconds=60),
    transport=httpx.HTTPTransport(limits=httpx.Limits(max_connections=20)),
)

sandbox = SandboxSync.create(
    "opensandbox/code-interpreter:latest",
    connection_config=config,
    entrypoint=["/opt/opensandbox/code-interpreter.sh"],
    env={"PYTHON_VERSION": "3.11"},
)
with sandbox:
    interpreter = CodeInterpreterSync.create(sandbox=sandbox)
    result = interpreter.codes.run("result = 2 + 2\nresult")
    if result.result:
        print(result.result[0].text)
    sandbox.kill()
```

## Runtime Configuration

### Docker Image

The Code Interpreter SDK relies on a specialized environment. Ensure your sandbox provider has the
`opensandbox/code-interpreter` image available.

### Language Version Selection

You can specify the desired version of a programming language by setting the corresponding environment variable when
creating the `Sandbox`.

| Language | Environment Variable | Example Value | Default (if unset) |
| -------- | -------------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| Python   | `PYTHON_VERSION`     | `3.11`        | Image default      |
| Java     | `JAVA_VERSION`       | `17`          | Image default      |
| Node.js  | `NODE_VERSION`       | `20`          | Image default      |
| Go       | `GO_VERSION`         | `1.24`        | Image default      |

## Usage Examples

### 0. Run with `language` (default language context)

You can pass `language` directly (recommended: `SupportedLanguage.*`) and skip `create_context`.
When `context.id` is omitted, **execd will create/reuse a default session for that language**, so
state can persist across runs:

```python
from code_interpreter import SupportedLanguage

execution = await interpreter.codes.run(
    "result = 2 + 2\nresult",
    language=SupportedLanguage.PYTHON,
)
assert execution.result and execution.result[0].text == "4"
```

State persistence example (default Python context):

```python
from code_interpreter import SupportedLanguage

await interpreter.codes.run("x = 42", language=SupportedLanguage.PYTHON)
execution = await interpreter.codes.run("result = x\nresult", language=SupportedLanguage.PYTHON)
assert execution.result and execution.result[0].text == "42"
```

### 1. Java Code Execution

```python
from code_interpreter import SupportedLanguage

ctx = await interpreter.codes.create_context(SupportedLanguage.JAVA)
execution = await interpreter.codes.run(
    (
        'System.out.println("Calculating sum...");\n'
        + "int a = 10;\n"
        + "int b = 20;\n"
        + "int sum = a + b;\n"
        + 'System.out.println("Sum: " + sum);\n'
        + "sum"
    ),
    context=ctx,
)

print(execution.id)
for msg in execution.logs.stdout:
    print(msg.text)
```

### 2. Python with State Persistence

Variables defined in one execution are available in subsequent executions within the same context.

```python
from code_interpreter import SupportedLanguage

ctx = await interpreter.codes.create_context(SupportedLanguage.PYTHON)

await interpreter.codes.run(
    "users = ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie']\nprint(len(users))",
    context=ctx,
)

result = await interpreter.codes.run(
    "users.append('Dave')\nprint(users)\nresult = users\nresult",
    context=ctx,
)
```

### 3. Streaming Output Handling

Handle stdout/stderr and execution events in real-time.

```python
from opensandbox.models.execd import ExecutionHandlers
from code_interpreter import SupportedLanguage

async def on_stdout(msg):
    print("STDOUT:", msg.text)

async def on_stderr(msg):
    print("STDERR:", msg.text)

handlers = ExecutionHandlers(on_stdout=on_stdout, on_stderr=on_stderr)

ctx = await interpreter.codes.create_context(SupportedLanguage.PYTHON)
await interpreter.codes.run(
    "import time\nfor i in range(5):\n    print(i)\n    time.sleep(0.5)",
    context=ctx,
    handlers=handlers,
)
```

### 4. Multi-Language Context Isolation

Different languages run in isolated environments.

```python
from code_interpreter import SupportedLanguage

py_ctx = await interpreter.codes.create_context(SupportedLanguage.PYTHON)
go_ctx = await interpreter.codes.create_context(SupportedLanguage.GO)

await interpreter.codes.run("print('Running in Python')", context=py_ctx)
await interpreter.codes.run(
    "package main\nfunc main() { println(\"Running in Go\") }",
    context=go_ctx,
)
```

## Notes

- **Lifecycle**: `CodeInterpreter` wraps an existing `Sandbox` instance and reuses its connection configuration.
- **Asyncio/event loop**: avoid sharing long-lived clients across multiple event loops (e.g. pytest-asyncio defaults).
