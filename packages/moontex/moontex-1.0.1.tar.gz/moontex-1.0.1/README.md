MoonTex is a procedural moon texture generator for Python that creates stylized, noise-based moon phase images with full control over surface detail, lighting geometry, color tinting, and export behavior.

MoonTex is designed for games, simulations, and procedural worlds, where moons are generated programmatically rather than painted by hand.

## Key Features
* Procedural moon surface using 2D simplex noise
* Manual crescent / gibbous shaping via phase_offset
* Quarter (half-lit) moons via phase_offset = 0
* Color-tinted moons (RGB or hex, CQCalendar-compatible)
* Multiple shadow styles (blend, alpha, multiply, auto)
* Soft terminator edge for smooth light-to-dark transitions
* Optional transparent background (RGBA)
* Deterministic output via seeds

Powered by Python, Pillow, and noise.
No heavy dependencies or GPU requirements.

## Example Usages
You probably already know what you're going to use MoonTex for but here are some example usages if you need ideas.

### Day/Night Cycle Skybox
Here's an example of MoonTex being used in a raycasting demo made with Tkinter and CQCalendar. The player is in a walled off grassy area with a pond in the middle. Underneath the 2D minimap, you can see the current time/date/moon phase. Time passes on an hourly basis. As day turns into night an image of the moon is shown in the sky based on the current moon phase.

## Dependency Installation
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
***
## How to Generate a Single Moon Phase Texture
```
#Initialize Generator
generator = moontex.MoonTex()

#You can specify the output directory if you want. Specify a moon phase name.
generator.export_moon_phase_image(output_dir=".", phase="Full Moon")
```
***
## How to Generate All Moon Phase Textures
```
#Initialize Generator
generator = moontex.MoonTex()

#You can specify the output directory if you want. Specify a moon phase name.
generator.export_all_moon_phase_images(output=".")
```
***
## Manual Shape & Color Control (Core Feature)
MoonTex does not force predefined lunar geometry.
You can define moon shapes directly using a continuous phase_offset:

-1.0 → thin waxing crescent

0.0 → half moon

1.0 → thin waning crescent

Combined with color tinting, this allows custom moons, magical events, or stylized worlds.

```
generator.generate(
	phase="Custom",
	phase_offset=-0.9,
	moon_color_hex="#ff0000",   # blood moon
	terminator_softness=1.5
)
```
If you use a custom phase name, phase_offset is required.
Built-in phase names work without it.

***
## Customization Options
```
MoonTex(
	# --- Core image settings ---
	image_size=300,              # int or (width, height)
	bg_color=(5, 5, 20),         # background RGB (used if not transparent)

	# --- Noise / surface detail ---
	noise_scale=0.01,
	octaves=3,
	persistence=0.5,
	lacunarity=3,
	seed=0,
	intensity=0.4,
	invert_crater_noise=True,

	# --- Brightness ---
	brightness=(50, 230),

	# --- Rendering ---
	transparent_background=False,
	padding=4,
	edge_softness=1.5,

	# --- Shadow behavior ---
	shadow_factor=0.15,
	shadow_mode="bg",            # legacy compatibility
	dark_floor=0.0,
)

```
***
## Shadow Styles (Per-Image)
When calling generate() you can choose how the dark side behaves:

* "blend" – blends into bg_color (classic look)
* "alpha" – uses transparency (best for skyboxes & overlays)
* "multiply" – multiplies light (stylized / painterly)
* "auto" – selects best option based on transparency
***
## Skybox Usage (Raycasting, Overlays)
```
MoonTex(
    transparent_background=True,
    shadow_mode="neutral",
    dark_floor=0.0,
)
```
***
## Standalone Image Usage
```
MoonTex(
    transparent_background=False,
    shadow_mode="bg",
)

```
***
## Built-In Phase Names
* "New / New Moon"
* "Waxing Crescent"
* "First Quarter"
* "Waxing Gibbous"
* "Full / Full Moon"
* "Waning Gibbous"
* "Last Quarter"
* "Waning Crescent"

You may also use custom phase names when supplying phase_offset.

## Related Tools
### MoonTex Studio
* MoonTex Studio is a visual GUI built on top of the MoonTex library that allows you to design, preview, and export procedural moon phases and full lunar cycles without writing code. It provides real-time previews, per-phase editing, and batch export tools for faster iteration in games and simulations.
