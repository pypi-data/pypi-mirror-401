# dlmhelper

This package includes functions and custom data types to help with performing and analyzing dynamic linear model fits. 

The initial version of this code was developed for the analysis performed in 'Zonal variability of methane trends derived from satellite data' (Hachmeister et al., 2023 ; DOI: [10.5194/acp-24-577-2024](https://doi.org/10.5194/acp-24-577-2024)).

Version v0.1.0 of this package is also used by the supplementary example code provided for the above mentioned paper, available on [Zenodo](http://www.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8178927).


## Requirements

- numpy
- matplotlib
- statsmodels
- tabulate

## Version

v1.0.0

## Installation

Install from PyPI using:

    pip install dlmhelper

## Usage

Look at the Nile or Manua Loa example from the _examples_ folder for a basic introduction.

Documentation is available [here](https://jonashach.github.io/dlmhelper/build/html/index.html)

## Known issues
- Sometimes variances (e.g., trend_cov) are negative. This is a numerical artifact from the underlying fitting routine used by the statsmodels package
