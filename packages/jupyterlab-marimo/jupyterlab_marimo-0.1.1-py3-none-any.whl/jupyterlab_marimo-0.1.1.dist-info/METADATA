              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,

              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You

              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include

# JupyterLab Marimo Extension

A JupyterLab extension that automatically opens Marimo notebooks in the Marimo editor instead of the default text editor or notebook interface.

![JupyterLab Marimo Extension](docs/jupyterlab_marimo.png)

## Features

- **Automatic File Type Registration**: Registers `.mo.py` files as a custom file type in JupyterLab
- **Seamless Integration**: Double-click `.mo.py` files in the file browser to open them directly in Marimo
- **Embedded Editor**: Displays the Marimo editor in an iframe within JupyterLab
- **Error Handling**: Provides clear error messages if Marimo or the proxy is not available
- **Context Menu**: Right-click on `.mo.py` files to open them in Marimo

## Installation

### User Installation (from PyPI)

Install the extension with a single command:

```bash
pip install jupyterlab-marimo
```

Or with `uv`:

```bash
uv pip install jupyterlab-marimo
```

This will automatically install all dependencies including:
- Marimo (>= 0.6.21)
- jupyter-server-proxy
- JupyterLab extension files

Then start JupyterLab:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

The extension will be automatically enabled!

### Development Installation

1. **Clone or create the extension directory**:
   ```bash
   cd marimo-jupyterlab-extension
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv sync --extra dev
   ```

3. **Install JavaScript dependencies**:
   ```bash
   uv run jlpm install
   ```

4. **Build the extension**:
   ```bash
   uv run jlpm build
   ```

5. **Install the extension in development mode**:
   ```bash
   uv run jupyter labextension develop . --overwrite
   ```

6. **Start JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

### Watch Mode (for Development)

To automatically rebuild the extension when you make changes:

```bash
uv run jlpm watch
```

In another terminal, run JupyterLab with watch mode:

```bash
jupyter lab --watch
```

## Usage

1. **Open JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

2. **Create or navigate to a `.mo.py` file**:
   - Create a new file with the `.mo.py` extension
   - Or navigate to an existing Marimo notebook

3. **Open the file**:
   - Double-click the `.mo.py` file in the file browser
   - Or right-click and select "Open in Marimo"

4. **The Marimo editor will open** in an embedded iframe within JupyterLab

## How It Works

The extension:

1. Registers `.mo.py` as a custom file type in JupyterLab
2. Creates a custom widget factory that handles `.mo.py` files
3. Embeds the Marimo editor in an iframe using the `jupyter-marimo-proxy` service
4. Constructs a proxied URL in the format: `/marimo/?file=<path>`
5. Passes the file path to Marimo for editing

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading

If the extension doesn't appear to be working:

1. **Check that the extension is installed**:
   ```bash
   jupyter labextension list
   ```
   You should see `marimo-jupyterlab-extension` in the list.

2. **Rebuild JupyterLab**:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab build
   ```

3. **Clear browser cache and restart JupyterLab**

### Marimo Proxy Not Available

If you see an error about the Marimo proxy not being available:

1. **Verify Marimo is installed**:
   ```bash
   pip show marimo
   ```

2. **Verify jupyter-server-proxy is installed**:
   ```bash
   pip show jupyter-server-proxy
   ```

3. **Check that the proxy is running**:
   - Open your browser's developer console (F12)
   - Look for any network errors related to `/marimo/`

4. **Restart JupyterLab** after installing dependencies

### File Path Issues

If the file doesn't open correctly:

- Ensure the file path is correct and the file exists
- Check the browser console for detailed error messages
- Verify that the file has the `.mo.py` extension

### Alternative URL Patterns

The extension tries to use the URL pattern `/marimo/?file=<path>`. If your `jupyter-marimo-proxy` configuration uses a different pattern, you may need to modify the URL construction in `src/index.ts` (line ~70).

Common patterns:
- `/marimo/?file=<path>` (default)
- `/marimo/edit?file=<path>`
- `/proxy/absolute/<port>/marimo/edit?file=<path>`

## Uninstallation

If you installed from PyPI:

```bash
pip uninstall jupyterlab-marimo
```

If you installed in development mode:

```bash
jupyter labextension develop --uninstall .
```

## Development

### Project Structure

```
marimo-jupyterlab-extension/
├── package.json          # Node.js dependencies and scripts
├── tsconfig.json         # TypeScript configuration
├── src/
│   └── index.ts         # Main extension code
├── style/

└── README.md            # This file
```

### Key Files

- **src/index.ts**: Contains the main plugin logic, including:
  - `MarimoEditorWidget`: The widget that embeds the Marimo editor
  - `MarimoEditorFactory`: Factory for creating Marimo editor widgets
  - Plugin registration and activation

- **style/index.css**: Styles for the Marimo editor widget

### Building

```bash
# Build the extension
uv run jlpm build

# Build for production (no source maps)
uv run jlpm build:prod

# Clean build artifacts
uv run jlpm clean
```

## Publishing (for Maintainers)

To publish a new version to PyPI:

1. **Update version** in `package.json`:
   ```json
   {
     "version": "0.2.0"
   }
   ```

2. **Clean and build**:
   ```bash
   uv run jlpm clean:all
   rm -rf dist build *.egg-info
   uv build
   ```

3. **Publish to PyPI**:
   ```bash
   uv publish
   ```

That's it! The Python package includes everything (JavaScript, labextension, dependencies). Users only need to `pip install jupyterlab-marimo`.

Note: The JavaScript/labextension is automatically built and bundled into the Python package via the `hatch-jupyter-builder` hooks in `pyproject.toml`. No npm account needed!
