    [#protodoc-title: Formatter extension for printing request without query string]
    [#extension: envoy.formatter.req_without_query]

    ReqWithoutQuery formatter extension implements REQ_WITHOUT_QUERY command operator that
    works the same way as :ref:`REQ <config_access_log_format_req>` except that it will
    remove the query string. It is used to avoid logging any sensitive information into
    the access log.
    See :ref:`here <config_access_log>` for more information on access log configuration.

    %REQ_WITHOUT_QUERY(X?Y):Z%
      An HTTP request header where X is the main HTTP header, Y is the alternative one, and Z is an
      optional parameter denoting string truncation up to Z characters long. The value is taken from
      the HTTP request header named X first and if it's not set, then request header Y is used. If
      none of the headers are present '-' symbol will be in the log.

    .. warning::
      Please use %PATH% to replace this extension.
      See :ref:`access log formats <config_access_log_format>` for more details.

    Configuration for the request without query formatter.
