    [#protodoc-title: Runtime matcher]
    [#extension: envoy.matching.matchers.runtime_fraction]

    The runtime fraction matchers computes a hash from the input and matches if runtime feature is enabled
    for the the resulting hash. Every time the input is considered for a match, its hash must fall within
    the percentage of matches indicated by this field. For a fraction N/D, a number is computed as a hash
    of the input on a field in the range [0,D). If the number is less than or equal to the value of the
    numerator N, the matcher evaluates to true. A runtime_fraction input matcher can be used to gradually
    roll out matcher changes without requiring full code or configuration deployments.
    Note that distribution of matching results is only as good as one of the input.
