    [#protodoc-title: Common match actions]

    Configuration for the SkipFilter match action. When matching results in this action, the
    associated filter will be ignored for all filter callbacks (e.g. ``encodeHeaders``, ``encodeData``,
    etc. for HTTP filters) after the matcher arrives at the match, including the callback that
    caused the match result. For example, when used with a HTTP filter and the match result was
    resolved after receiving the HTTP response headers, the HTTP filter will *not* receive the
    response header callback.

    As a result, if this match action is resolved before the first filter callback (e.g. HTTP request
    headers), the filter will be completely skipped.
