    [#protodoc-title: External Processing Filter]
    External Processing Filter
    [#extension: envoy.filters.http.ext_proc]

    The External Processing filter allows an external service to act on HTTP traffic in a flexible way.

    The filter communicates with an external gRPC service called an "external processor"
    that can do a variety of things with the request and response:

    * Access and modify the HTTP headers on the request, response, or both.
    * Access and modify the HTTP request and response bodies.
    * Access and modify the dynamic stream metadata.
    * Immediately send an HTTP response downstream and terminate other processing.

    The filter communicates with the server using a gRPC bidirectional stream. After the initial
    request, the external server is in control over what additional data is sent to it
    and how it should be processed.

    By implementing the protocol specified by the stream, the external server can choose:

    * Whether it receives the response message at all.
    * Whether it receives the message body at all, in separate chunks, or as a single buffer.
    * To modify request or response trailers if they already exist.

    The filter supports up to six different processing steps. Each is represented by
    a gRPC stream message that is sent to the external processor. For each message, the
    processor must send a matching response.

    * Request headers: Contains the headers from the original HTTP request.
    * Request body: If the body is present, the behavior depends on the
      body send mode. In ``BUFFERED`` or ``BUFFERED_PARTIAL`` mode, the body is sent to the external
      processor in a single message. In ``STREAMED`` or ``FULL_DUPLEX_STREAMED`` mode, the body will
      be split across multiple messages sent to the external processor. In ``NONE`` mode, the body
      will not be sent to the external processor.
    * Request trailers: Delivered if they are present and if the trailer mode is set
      to ``SEND``.
    * Response headers: Contains the headers from the HTTP response. Keep in mind
      that if the upstream system sends them before processing the request body that
      this message may arrive before the complete body.
    * Response body: Sent according to the processing mode like the request body.
    * Response trailers: Delivered according to the processing mode like the
      request trailers.

    By default, the processor sends only the request and response headers messages.
    This may be changed to include any of the six steps by changing the ``processing_mode``
    setting of the filter configuration, or by setting the ``mode_override`` of any response
    from the external processor. The latter is only enabled if ``allow_mode_override`` is
    set to true. This way, a processor may, for example, use information
    in the request header to determine whether the message body must be examined, or whether
    the data plane should simply stream it straight through.

    All of this together allows a server to process the filter traffic in fairly
    sophisticated ways. For example:

    * A server may choose to examine all or part of the HTTP message bodies depending
      on the content of the headers.
    * A server may choose to immediately reject some messages based on their HTTP
      headers (or other dynamic metadata) and more carefully examine others.

    The protocol itself is based on a bidirectional gRPC stream. The data plane will send the server
    :ref:`ProcessingRequest <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingRequest>`
    messages, and the server must reply with
    :ref:`ProcessingResponse <envoy_v3_api_msg_service.ext_proc.v3.ProcessingResponse>`.

    Stats about each gRPC call are recorded in a :ref:`dynamic filter state
    <arch_overview_advanced_filter_state_sharing>` object in a namespace matching the filter
    name.
