    If this is set, requests sent upstream to populate the cache will go to the

    If you have actions to be taken by the router filter - either
    ``upstream_http_filters`` or one of the ``RouteConfiguration`` actions such as
    ``response_headers_to_add`` - then the cache's side-channel going directly to the
    routed cluster will bypass these actions. You can set ``override_upstream_cluster``
    to an internal listener which duplicates the relevant ``RouteConfiguration``, to
    replicate the desired behavior on the side-channel upstream request issued by the
    cache.
