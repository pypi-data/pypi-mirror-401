    [#protodoc-title: Client-Side Weighted Round Robin Load Balancing Policy]
    [#extension: envoy.load_balancing_policies.client_side_weighted_round_robin]

    Configuration for the client_side_weighted_round_robin LB policy.

    This policy differs from the built-in ROUND_ROBIN policy in terms of
    how the endpoint weights are determined. In the ROUND_ROBIN policy,
    the endpoint weights are sent by the control plane via EDS. However,
    in this policy, the endpoint weights are instead determined via qps (queries
    per second), eps (errors per second), and utilization metrics sent by the
    endpoint using the Open Request Cost Aggregation (ORCA) protocol. Utilization
    is determined by using the ORCA application_utilization field, if set, or
    else falling back to the cpu_utilization field. All queries count toward qps,
    regardless of result. Only failed queries count toward eps. A config
    parameter error_utilization_penalty controls the penalty to adjust endpoint
    weights using eps and qps. The weight of a given endpoint is computed as:
    ``qps / (utilization + eps/qps * error_utilization_penalty)``.

    Note that Envoy will forward the ORCA response headers/trailers from the upstream
    cluster to the downstream client. This means that if the downstream client is also
    configured to use ``client_side_weighted_round_robin`` it will load balance against
    Envoy based on upstream weights. This can happen when Envoy is used as a reverse proxy.
    To avoid this issue you can configure the :ref:`header_mutation filter  <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.header_mutation.v3.HeaderMutation>` to remove
    the ORCA payload from the response headers/trailers.

    See the :ref:`load balancing architecture
    overview<arch_overview_load_balancing_types>` for more information.
