    Abstract base class defining the interface for a spin-system "Context".

    A Context encapsulates the physical model of relaxation and initial state in time-resolved EPR.
    It specifies:
      - The basis in which relaxation parameters (transition probabilities, loss rates, etc.) are defined,
      - The initial population vector or density matrix,
      - Time-dependence profiles for any parameter
      - Transformation rules to map all quantities into the field-dependent Hamiltonian eigenbasis.

    MarS distinguishes two relaxation paradigms:
      1. **Population-based**: Only diagonal elements (populations) evolve; off-diagonal coherences are neglected.
      2. **Density-matrix-based**: Full dynamic including coherences and decoherence.

    differs from the field-dependent eigenbasis required for dynamics calculations.

    Supported transformations:
    1. Vector transformation: For initial populations and loss rates
    2. Matrix transformation: For transition probability matrices
    3. Density matrix transformation: For initial quantum states
    4. Superoperator transformation: For Liouville-space relaxation operators

        * "product": Product basis of individual spin projections |m_s1, m_s2, ...⟩

        Return the induced relaxation superoperator in Liouville space.

        This superoperator contains only non-thermal (driven) processes that are NOT
        constrained by detailed balance. It is transformed to the eigenbasis without
        thermal correction.

        :param full_system_vectors: Eigenvectors of the full Hamiltonian.
        :param time_dep_values: Optional time_dep_values for evaluation if loss rates are time-dependent.

        :return: Superoperator R_driven with shape [..., N², N²].

        Construction method:
        Built using Lindblad formalism from induced transition rates:
            L_{kl} = √D_{kl} |k⟩⟨l|
        If the initial superoperator is given then it is used as superoperator

        Transformation rule:
            R_new = (U ⊗ U*) · R_old · (U ⊗ U*)
            where U is the basis transformation matrix and ⊗ denotes Kronecker product

        Unlike the free superoperator, NO thermal correction is applied to these elements,
        as they represent processes that actively drive the system away from equilibrium.

        Note: If a user provides a complete superoperator directly (bypassing individual
        rates), it is interpreted as an induced superoperator and no thermal correction
        is applied.

class Context(TransformedContext):
    """
    Primary implementation of a spin relaxation context for a sample

    This class provides a flexible interface for specifying relaxation models through:
    - Basis specification (explicit matrix or string identifier)
    - Initial state definition (populations or full density matrix)
    - Transition rate matrices (spontaneous, induced, loss terms)
    - Decoherence rates (for density-matrix paradigm)
    - Time-dependent profile functions

    Physical interpretation of parameters:
    - free_probs: Thermal (Boltzmann-weighted) transition rates between states
    - driven_probs: Non-thermal transition rates not constrained by detailed balance
    - out_probs: Irreversible loss rates from states (e.g., phosphorescence)
    - decoherences: Rates of quantum coherence decay between states
    - init_populations: Initial state populations in the working basis
    - init_density: Complete initial quantum state (includes coherences)

    The class supports both simple constant rates and time-dependent functions for all
    rate parameters, enabling modeling of complex time-evolving systems.

    Algebraic operations:
    - Addition (+): Combines multiple relaxation mechanisms acting on the SAME system
    - Tensor product (@): Combines independent subsystems into a composite quantum system

    These operations follow the physical rules described in the MarS documentation and
    enable construction of sophisticated relaxation models from simpler components.

        :param basis: torch.Tensor or str or None, optional
        Basis specifier. Three allowed forms:
          -`str`: one of {"zfs", "multiplet", "product", "eigen"}. If a string is
            given, `sample` **must** be provided so the basis can be constructed.
            * "zfs"       : eigenvectors of the zero-field Hamiltonian (unsqueezed)
            * "multiplet" : total spin multiplet basis |S, M⟩
            * "product"   : computational product basis |ms1, ms2, ..., is1, ...⟩
            * "eigen"     : use the eigen basis at the resonance fields (represented as `None`)
            In all cases except the product case, the basis is sorted in ascending order of eigenvalues.
            In the product basis, sorting occurs in descending order of projections.
          - `torch.Tensor`: explicit basis tensor. Expected shapes:
                `[N, N]` for a single basis or `[R / 1, K / 1, N, N]` for R orientations and K transitions
            Tensor must be square in its last two dimensions.
          - `None`: indicates the eigen basis will be used (no transformation).

        :param sample: MultiOrientedSample or None, optional
            Required when `basis` is specified as a `str`. Provides helper methods
            for building basis tensors for the requested basis type.

        :param init_populations: torch.Tensor or list[float] or None, optional
            The param is ignored if init_density is provided!

            Initial populations at the working basis or as a list. Shape `[..., N]`.
            If provided, it will be converted to a `torch.tensor` and optionally
            normalized by `get_transformed_init_populations`.

        :param init_density: torch.Tensor, optional.
            Initial density of the spin system. Shape [..., N, N]
            If provided then init_populations will be ignored and populations will be computed as
            diagonal elements of init_density (as it needed)

        :param free_probs:   torch.Tensor or callable or None, optional
            Thermal (Boltzmann-weighted) transition probabilities.
            It can be set as symmetrix matrix of mean transition probabilities. Accepts either:
              - a tensor shaped `[..., N, N]`
                [[0,  w],
                 [w, 0]]
              , or
              - a callable `f(time) -> tensor` that returns the tensor at requested times.

        :param driven_probs: torch.Tensor [..., N, N] or None
            Probabilities of driven transitions (e.g. due to external driving).
            DR matrix is a matrix of driven transitions that are not connected by thermal equilibrium:
             [[0,  dr_1],
             [dr_2, 0]]

        :param out_probs: torch.Tensor or list[float] or callable or None, optional
            Out-of-system transition probabilities (loss terms). Expected shapes:
              - `[..., N]` (or `[..., T, N]`), or
              - Python list of length `N` (converted to tensor), or
              - callable `f(time) -> tensor`.

        :param decoherences: torch.Tensor or callable or None, optional
            decoherences relaxation rates with shape [N].
            Each element set the Decreasing of the non-diagonal matrix elements of density matrix
            d <i|rho|j> / dt = -(decoherences[i] + decoherences[j]) / 2 * <i|rho|j>
            If relaxation_superop is given, then this parameter is ignored
        For implementation of decoherences, out_probs, driven_probs, free_probs we use Lindblad form of relaxation.

        :param relaxation_superop: torch.Tensor or callable or None, optional
            Full superoperator of relaxation rates for density matrix
            with shape [N*N, N*N]. Any elements can be given.
            If it is given then  driven_probs are ignored
            but free_probs, decoherences, out_probs are computed
            After transformation the thermal correction is not used for this term

        :param profile: callable or None, optional
            Callable `profile(time: torch.Tensor) -> torch.Tensor` that returns
            time-dependent scalars/arrays used by `get_time_dependent_values`.
            If None, `get_time_dependent_values` will raise if called.

        :param time_dimension: int, optional
            Axis index where time should be broadcasted in returned tensors.
            Default -5 to match the code's broadcasting conventions.

    is described by its own context, and the composite system follows quantum mechanical
    tensor product rules.

    Key physical principles:
    1. State space: The Hilbert space of the composite system is the tensor product of
       subsystem Hilbert spaces: H = H₁ ⊗ H₂ ⊗ ... ⊗ Hₙ
    2. Initial state: The initial density matrix is the tensor product of subsystem states:
       ρ = ρ₁ ⊗ ρ₂ ⊗ ... ⊗ ρₙ
    3. Dynamics: Each subsystem evolves according to its own Hamiltonian and relaxation
       operators, which are embedded into the composite space using tensor products with
       identity operators.

    Transformation rules:
    - Basis transformations use Clebsch-Gordan coefficients to map between product bases
      and coupled bases
    - Initial populations are transformed using tensor products of transformation matrices
    - Relaxation superoperators are transformed using Kronecker products of basis
      transformation matrices

    Mathematical formulation:
    The total relaxation is described by the sum of individual contributions:

        R_total = R₁ + R₂ + ... + Rₙ    (for density matrix dynamics)

    This context type is essential when relaxation arises from multiple distinct physical
    processes that can be modeled separately but act simultaneously on the system.
