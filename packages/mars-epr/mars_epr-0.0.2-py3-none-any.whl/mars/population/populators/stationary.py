class StationaryPopulator(core.BasePopulator):
    """
   Computes the population-dependent part of the transition intensity for stationary (CW) EPR spectra.

   The population difference between upper and lower resonant levels determines the net absorption
   (or emission) intensity. Two initialization strategies are supported:

   1. **Thermal equilibrium**: Populations follow the Boltzmann distribution at `init_temperature`:
       p_i ∝ exp(−E_i / k_B T),
      and the population difference for a transition i ← j is:
       Δp = p_j − p_i.
      This is used when no Context is provided, or when the Context does not define initial populations.

   2. **Context-defined populations**: If the Context specifies initial populations (e.g., photoexcited
      triplet sublevel polarization), these are used instead of thermal values. The populations are
      automatically transformed into the field-dependent eigenbasis using `full_system_vectors`.
