class LevelBasedPopulator(core.BaseTimeDepPopulator):
    """
    LevelBasedPopulator implements time-resolved EPR signal modeling within the kinetic
    (population-based) relaxation paradigm.

    This class assumes that only the diagonal elements of the density matrix (populations of energy levels)
    evolve in time.
    Transitions between levels are governed by a kinetic matrix K derived from the provided Context, which may include:
      - Spontaneous (free) transitions respecting detailed balance,
      - Induced (forced) transitions,
      - Loss terms (e.g., phosphorescence decay from triplet states).

    The initial populations are either computed from thermal equilibrium at `init_temperature` or taken from the Context,
    if explicitly defined.

    This approach is computationally efficient and suitable for systems where coherence effects are negligible
    (e.g., high-temperature or strongly relaxing systems).

            The following solvers are available:

            It uses automatic control of time-steps. If you are not sure about the correct time-steps use it
            - stationary_rate_solver. When A does not depend on time use it.
            It just uses that in this case n(t) = exp(At) @ n0
            - exponential_solver. When A does depend on time but does not depend on n,
            It is possible to precompute A and exp(A) in all points.
            In this case the solution is n_i+1 = exp(A_idt) @ ni
