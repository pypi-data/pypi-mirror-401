    """
    RWADensityPopulator

    Computes time-dependent signal intensity using the density matrix formalism
    under the Rotating Wave Approximation (RWA).

    Relaxation dynamics are computed efficiently within the RWA framework,
    with relaxation parameters provided by the Context.

    Note: The Rotating Wave Approximation introduces several important constraints:

    1. The oscillating magnetic field (e.g., microwave or RF) is assumed to be circularly polarized.
    2. The g-tensor must be isotropic, meaning the Zeeman operators are proportional to spin operators:
       Gx = g * mu_B * Sx, Gy = g * mu_B * Sy, Gz = g * mu_B * Sz.,
    3. The static part of the Hamiltonian (denoted F) must commute with Gz (i.e., [F, Gz] = 0).
    4. The relaxation superoperator Rijkl—which couples matrix elements rho_ij
    and rho_kl - is only non-zero when i - j equals k - l.
       This covers two processes:
       - Population transfer between energy levels (i = j, k = l), including pure decay (i = j = k = l).
       - Dephasing of coherences (i = k, j = l).

            It just uses that in this case n(t) = exp(At) @ n0
            - exponential_solver. When A does depend on time but does not depend on n,
            It is possible to precompute A and exp(A) in all points.

class PropagatorDensityPopulator(RWADensityPopulator):
    """
    PropagatorDensityPopulator computes time-resolved EPR signals by explicitly evaluating the full
    time-evolution propagator U(t, 0).

    This method supports:
      - Arbitrary g-tensor anisotropy,
      - General relaxation superoperators (including coherence-population coupling),
      - Any kind of zero field splitting.

    The propagator is computed over one period of the microwave field and then extrapolated
    to arbitrary detection times using Floquet theory. For disordered (powder) samples,
    the signal is averaged over the Euler angle γ by evaluating two orthogonal field polarizations.

    While more computationally demanding than RWA-based methods, this approach is necessary
    for systems where RWA assumptions (isotropic g, circular polarization, [F, Gz] = 0) are violated,
    such as in single-molecule magnets, metal complexes, or high-field EPR.

        The orientation of the molecule is described by three Euler angles.
        The first two angles determine the energy and eigenvectors.
        The last angle does not change the energy or eigenvectors, but it does alter the signal intensity.
        This can be described as a rotation between Gx and Gy. Thus, the final signal is the average of this rotation.
