class BasePopulator(nn.Module):
    """
    Base class for populators.

    A populator is responsible for computing the part of the EPR transition intensity
    that depends on the populations of energy levels (or the full density matrix in more advanced cases).
    This includes:
      - Thermal equilibrium populations (Boltzmann distribution),
      - Context-defined initial populations,
      - Population differences between resonant upper and lower states.

    This class supports both stationary and time-dependent scenarios through inheritance.
    It handles initialization from temperature or from a relaxation Context,
    and provides unified access to population initialization logic.

    The actual intensity computation (including matrix elements, line shapes, etc.)
    is performed downstream in the spectra creator; the populator only supplies
    the population-dependent factor.

class BaseTimeDepPopulator(BasePopulator):
    """
      Base class for time-dependent populators that model relaxation dynamics in time-resolved EPR.

      This class implements the common infrastructure for solving the kinetic or Liouville-von Neumann
      equations that govern the evolution of populations or the density matrix:
        dn/dt = K(t, n) · n        (population-based)
        dρ/dt = -i[H, ρ] + R[ρ]    (density matrix-based)

      Key components:
        1. **Populator**: Defines initial state and numerical strategy (this class and subclasses).
        2. **Context**: Encodes physical relaxation mechanisms (losses, spontaneous/induced transitions,
           decoherence) and their basis of definition.
        3. **Transition matrix generator**: Constructs the relaxation operator (K or R) from Context.
        4. **Solver**: Integrates the evolution equation (stationary, quasi-stationary, or adaptive ODE).

      Subclasses must implement:
        - `init_solver`: selects appropriate integrator based on time-dependence,
        - `_init_tr_matrix_generator`: builds generator for relaxation superoperator,
        - `forward`: orchestrates the full computation pipeline.

            It just uses that in this case n(t) = exp(At) @ n0
            - exponential_solver. When A does depend on time but does not depend on n,
            It is possible to precompute A and exp(A) in all points.
            In this case the solution is n_i+1 = exp(A_idt) @ ni
