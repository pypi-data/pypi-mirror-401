## Market Viability Score

### Scoring Criteria

| Factor | Score | Rationale |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| **Market Size** | 4/5 | SAM of $150-200M is substantial but niche |
| **Growth Rate** | 5/5 | 20-40% CAGR across relevant segments |
| **Problem Severity** | 4/5 | Tool fragmentation is real pain point |
| **Competition** | 3/5 | Fragmented but well-funded players exist |
| **Timing** | 5/5 | AI adoption at peak, short-form video booming |
| **Fit for Solo** | 4/5 | Micro-SaaS model viable, niche focus helps |

### Overall Market Viability Score

## 4.2 / 5 Stars

**Rationale:**
The fitness creator tools market is viable for a solopreneur SaaS product based on:

1. **Strong tailwinds**: 20-40% CAGR in relevant segments
2. **Real problem**: Tool fragmentation acknowledged industry-wide
3. **Target segment growing**: Micro/nano influencers are the fastest-growing tier
4. **AI adoption mainstream**: 84% of creators already using AI tools
5. **Niche defensibility**: Fitness-specific focus creates differentiation
6. **Realistic SOM**: $35-50K Year 1 is achievable for solo operation

**Cautions:**
- Consumer AI fatigue is real (26% enthusiasm vs 60% in 2023)
- Must differentiate from well-funded horizontal tools (CapCut, Descript)
- Fitness is niche - limits total ceiling
- Customer acquisition in crowded creator tools space is challenging

---

## Recommendations

1. **Focus on micro/nano tier** (1K-50K followers) - underserved, fastest growing
2. **Lead with jump-cut video editing** - highest pain point, AI can solve well
3. **Emphasize authenticity preservation** - counter AI backlash concerns
4. **Revenue tracking as differentiator** - identified gap in market
5. **Consider freemium with aggressive limits** - match market expectations
6. **Target English-speaking markets first** - US (37% market share) + UK/AU/CA
