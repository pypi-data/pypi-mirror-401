           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable

              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
        
              To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "{}"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

# pybrowsertestfw Module and Sample Project

## 1. pybrowsertestfw Module Overview

This project provides a lightweight test automation core module based on pytest, targeting a unified usage pattern and reporting output for Web (Selenium) and mobile (Appium). It is ready to use with a “convention over configuration” style. Once installed from PyPI as `pybrowsertestfw`, it can be reused in any project.

### Positioning
- Unified: Web and mobile operations share the same abstraction, and screenshot/report paths are consistent.
- Simple: Zero-parameter default behaviors (such as `WebActions.screenshot()`), with a minimal usable API set.
- Visible: Built-in HTML, PDF, and JSON reports, automatically attaching screenshots and runtime logs.

### Features
- Reports and attachments
  - Automatically generates `reports/<ts>/report_<ts>.html`, `report_<ts>.pdf`, and `report_<ts>.json`.
  - Screenshots are uniformly named `screenshot/ss_{YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS}.png` and injected into the report.
- Logging
  - Root log is written to `reports/<ts>/framework_<ts>.log`.
  - Provides `get_logger(name)` to obtain a named logger consistently.
- Minimal APIs
  - Direct attach: `capture_and_attach(config, rep, driver, label)`.
  - Queue-based: `capture_and_queue_simple(driver)` plus a unified attach step in plugin hooks.

### Installation and Integration
```bash
pip install pybrowsertestfw
```
Or add the dependency to your existing `pyproject.toml`:
```toml
[project]
dependencies = [
  "pybrowsertestfw>=0.1.0",
]
```
After installation, pytest will automatically load the plugin `framework.pytest_plugin` via entry points, no extra parameters required.

> Python version requirement: supports Python 3.9.x - 3.13.x (`requires-python = ">=3.9, <3.14"`).

### Module Directory (Simplified)
```
├── framework/
│   ├── config.py              # CLI/session configuration parsing
│   ├── driver_factory.py      # WebDriver/Appium driver creation
│   ├── logger.py              # Logging configuration and entry
│   ├── reporting.py           # Reporting and screenshots

    └── recorder.py            # Screen recording implementation (Web/Appium)
```

This repository only contains reusable framework core code (released as the `pybrowerstestfw` package).

## 2. Create a Sample Project

The following uses a minimal sample project to demonstrate how to quickly set up and run locally.

### Directory Layout
```
├── drivers/
│   └── chromedriver.exe
├── properties.yml
├── pytest.ini
├── requirements.txt
├── test_order.yml
├── tests/
│   └── test_sample.py
├── datas/         # Optional
|   └── data.csv
└── reports/       # Generated at runtime
|   └── <ts>/
|       ├── report_<ts>.html
|       ├── report_<ts>.pdf
|       ├── report_<ts>.json
|       ├── framework_<ts>.log
|       └── screenshot/
|           └── ss_*.png
```

### Browser and Mobile Drivers
- Path consistency: All desktop browser drivers should be placed in the `drivers/` directory under the project root (lowercase).
- Version matching: Each browser driver’s major version must match the corresponding browser’s major version on the machine, otherwise session creation may fail.
- Desktop examples:
  - In `properties.yml`, point `executable_path` to the corresponding file <mark>(Safari excluded)</mark>.
  - Chrome: example path `.\\drivers\\chromedriver.exe`.
  - Edge: example path `.\\drivers\\msedgedriver.exe`.
  - Firefox: example path `.\\drivers\\geckodriver.exe`.
  - Safari (macOS): uses the system `safaridriver`. Run `safaridriver --enable` on macOS to pre-authorize; no local `executable_path` is needed.
- Mobile examples:
  - Android: set `'appium:chromedriverExecutable'` in capabilities to a valid ChromeDriver absolute path, for example `'C:\\Drivers\\chromedriver.exe'`, to drive mobile Chrome/WebView.
  - iOS: connect real devices or simulators through Appium, which relies on the device’s `safaridriver` capabilities. No additional browser driver files are required in the project.
- Remote mode: When connecting to Selenium Grid, local `executable_path` is usually unnecessary; driver versions are managed on the remote side.

### Quick Start

**1. Create a project directory and enter it, for example:**
```bash
mkdir my_sample_project
cd my_sample_project
```

**2. Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
- Windows (PowerShell):
  ```powershell
  python -m venv .venv
  .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
  ```
- Windows (cmd):
  ```bat
  python -m venv .venv
  .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
  ```
- macOS / Linux (shell):
  ```bash
  python -m venv .venv
  source .venv/bin/activate
  ```

**3. Create and fill `requirements.txt`:**
```text
pybrowerstestfw>=0.1.0
```

**4. Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**5. Create `pytest.ini`:**
```ini
[pytest]
markers =
    smoke: 'smoke test'
addopts = --strict
```

**6. Create `properties.yml`:**
```yaml
# This is an example of Chrome configuration.
chrome:
  browserName: 'chrome'
  executable_path: '.\\drivers\\chromedriver.exe'
  'goog:chromeOptions':
    args:
      - '--start-maximized'
    experimentalOptions:
      excludeSwitches:
        - 'enable-automation'
```

**7. Create `test_order.yml` (optional, to control execution order):**
```yaml
- "tests/test_sample.py::test_demo_aut"
```

**8. Create a sample test `tests/test_sample.py`**
  - Example 1:
    - Test case without CSV:
      ```python
      import pytest
      from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By


      @pytest.mark.smoke
      def test_demo_aut(driver, acts: WebActions):
          driver.get("https://katalon-test.s3.amazonaws.com/aut/html/form.html")
          driver.find_element(By.ID, "first-name").clear()
          driver.find_element(By.ID, "first-name").send_keys("Alex")
          driver.find_element(By.ID, "last-name").clear()
          driver.find_element(By.ID, "last-name").send_keys("Smith")
          acts.screenshot()
      ```

- Example 2:
  - Test case using CSV:
    ```python
    import pytest
    from selenium.webdriver.common.by import By

    from operations.web import WebActions


    @pytest.mark.smoke
    def test_demo_aut(driver, acts: WebActions):
        rows = acts.load_vars_from_csv("data.csv")
        for row in rows:
            first = row.get("first", "")
            last = row.get("last", "")

            driver.get("https://katalon-test.s3.amazonaws.com/aut/html/form.html")
            driver.find_element(By.ID, "first-name").clear()
            driver.find_element(By.ID, "first-name").send_keys(first)
            driver.find_element(By.ID, "last-name").clear()
            driver.find_element(By.ID, "last-name").send_keys(last)

            acts.screenshot()
    ```

  - Create test data file `datas/data.csv`:
    ```text
    first,last
    Alex,Smith
    Steve,Rogers
    ```

**9. Run the sample test**
```bash
pytest --profile="chrome" -q tests/test_sample.py
```

**10. Open the reports**
- HTML: `reports/<ts>/report_<ts>.html`
- JSON: `reports/<ts>/report_<ts>.json`
- PDF: `reports/<ts>/report_<ts>.pdf`
- Log: `reports/<ts>/framework_<ts>.log`
- Screenshots: `reports/<ts>/screenshot/ss_*.png`

### Basic Usage
- Get a named logger
```python
from framework.logger import get_logger
logger = get_logger("operations.web")
```
- Example usage of `screenshot`
```python
from operations.web import WebActions

web = WebActions(driver)
web.screenshot()
```
- Example usage of `load_vars_from_csv`
```python
from operations.web import WebActions

def test_sample_two(driver, acts: WebActions):
  rows = acts.load_vars_from_csv("data.csv")
  for row in rows:
      first = row.get("first", "")
      last = row.get("last", "")

      driver.get("https://katalon-test.s3.amazonaws.com/aut/html/form.html")
      driver.find_element(By.ID, "first-name").clear()
      driver.find_element(By.ID, "first-name").send_keys(first)
      driver.find_element(By.ID, "last-name").clear()
      driver.find_element(By.ID, "last-name").send_keys(last)
```

### Configuration
- `requirements.txt`: Declare project dependencies, at least `pybrowerstestfw`, `pytest`, and `selenium`.
- `pytest.ini`: Pytest global configuration, defines markers and strict mode.
- `properties.yml`: Stores browser/device capabilities (caps) that the framework reads to create corresponding drivers.
- `test_order.yml`: Optional, used to specify test execution order.
- At session start, the plugin automatically:
  - Initializes report directories and filenames (`init_reporting`).
  - Configures the root logger (`setup_logging`).

### Reporting and Screenshot Flow
- During test execution: `WebActions.screenshot()` → `capture_and_queue_simple(driver)` saves PNG files and enqueues them.
- Reporting phase: The plugin triggers `drain_pending_extras`, attaching all queued images to the HTML report via `rep.extras`.
- JSON report: Automatically injects a `screenshots` field with relative paths.

### Test Ordering (Without pytest-order)
- Supports controlling execution order via the `test_order.yml` manifest, without modifying test files, and is compatible with Katalon scripts exported in bulk or individually.
- Usage:
  - Create `test_order.yml` in the project root. Each item is a NodeID pattern (YAML list), matched in declared order:
    - `tests/test_login.py::test_login`
    - `tests/test_saucedemo_v2.py::test_*`
    - `tests/generated/**/test_*.py::test_*`
  - Verify collection order: `pytest --collect-only -p no:order`
- Notes:
  - The framework registers `pytest_collection_modifyitems` in the plugin and delegates to `framework/order.py`. If `pytest-order` is also installed, it may reorder items again after collection; it is recommended to disable it via `-p no:order` or remove it from dependencies.
  - Items not matched in `test_order.yml` maintain default ordering and run after matched items. Parallel execution (`pytest-xdist`) may break ordering; disable parallelism or use single-test orchestration when strict ordering is required.

### Extension Points
- Custom CLI options
  - `--profile`: Specify the capabilities key (caps) in `properties.yml`. Example: `--profile web_chrome`.
  - `--remote-address`: Remote WebDriver/Appium address. Example (Selenium Grid): `http://localhost:4444/wd/hub`; example (Appium): `http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub`.
  - `--video`: Whether to record video (`y|n`, default `n`). Output file: `reports/<ts>/video_<ts>.mp4`.
  - Notes: For Web (Selenium) it uses a built-in screen recorder (bundled in `video/pyscreenrec.py`) to capture the entire screen (non-headless is recommended). For mobile (Appium) it uses the driver’s built-in recording.
  - Examples:
    ```bash
    # Local browser (Chrome, local driver)
    pytest --profile="chrome" -m "smoke"
    
    # Remote Selenium Grid (Chrome)
    pytest --profile="chrome" --remote-address="http://localhost:4444/wd/hub" -m "smoke"
    
    # Appium (mobile Web): requires remote mode + browserName
    pytest --profile="android_chrome" --remote-address="http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub" -m "smoke" --video="y"
    
    # Local browser (Edge)
    pytest --profile="edge_local" -m "smoke"
    
    # Local browser (Firefox)
    pytest --profile="firefox_local" -m "smoke"
    
    # Safari (macOS only)
    pytest --profile="safari_mac" -m "smoke"
    ```

- Appium usage example (mobile Web)
  - `properties.yml` example:
    ```yaml
    android_chrome:
      platformName: 'Android'
      browserName: 'chrome'
      'appium:automationName': 'UiAutomator2'
      'appium:deviceName': 'emulator-5554'
      'appium:noReset': true
      'appium:chromedriverExecutable': 'C:\\Drivers\\chromedriver.exe'
      'goog:chromeOptions':
        experimentalOptions:
          w3c: false

    ios_safari:
      platformName: 'iOS'
      browserName: 'safari'
      'appium:automationName': 'XCUITest'
      'appium:deviceName': 'iPhone 15'
      'appium:udid': '000XXX20-001C35XXXE42XXXX'
      'appium:noReset': true
      'appium:nativeWebTap': true
      'appium:safariAllowPopups': false
      'appium:safariIgnoreFraudWarning': true
    ```
  - Run example:
    ```bash
    # Android Chrome (ensure Appium Server is running)
    pytest --profile="android_chrome" --remote-address="http://127.0.0.1:4723/wd/hub" -m "smoke"
    ```
  - Note: The current version requires `browserName` in `capabilities` (for mobile Web/WebView).

### Locator Strategy Compatibility (Mobile Web / Appium)
- In mobile Web sessions through Appium→WebDriver, the server enforces locator strategies more strictly. Directly using `using: "id"|"name"|"class name"` may be considered invalid and return `invalid locator` (400).
- If test cases call `driver.find_element("id", ...)` directly, mobile Web scenarios may still fail. Using CSS or XPath locators is recommended.

### FAQ
- Screenshots not visible? Ensure you are using a `pytest-html` version that supports `rep.extras` (4.1.x or above).
- Paths too long? The framework removes `nodeid` in filenames and uses timestamps to keep them short and consistent.
