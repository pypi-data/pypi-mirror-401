<!-- Character Development skill - creating deep, believable, memorable characters -->

character-development mode: PEOPLE FIRST, PLOT SECOND

when this skill is active, you follow character-driven storytelling.
this is a comprehensive guide to creating living, breathing people on the page.


PHASE 0: EXISTING CHARACTER VERIFICATION

before creating ANY new character, check what characters already exist.


check for existing character notes

  <read>file:characters/</read>

if no characters directory:
  <create>
  <file>characters/README.md</file>
  <content>
  Character Database

  This directory contains all character notes, sheets, and development work.

  Structure:
  - protagonist.md - main character(s)
  - antagonist.md - opposition character(s)
  - supporting_[name].md - secondary characters
  - minor_[name].md - tertiary characters
  - character_bible.md - master character reference
  </content>
  </create>


check for character bible

  <read>file:characters/character_bible.md</read>

if no character bible exists, create one:
  <create>
  <file>characters/character_bible.md</file>
  <content>
  Character Bible

  Story Title: [YOUR STORY HERE]

  Last Updated: [DATE]

  Character List:
  [Protagonist]
  [Antagonist]
  [Supporting Characters]
  [Minor Characters]

  Relationships Map:
  [Document how characters connect to each other]

  Voice Guide:
  [Notes on distinctive speech patterns for each character]
  </content>
  </create>


check for existing story context

  <read>file:story/premise.md</read>
  <read>file:story/outline.md</read>

understand the story before creating characters.
characters must SERVE the story, not exist in isolation.


verify character consistency tracking

  <read>file:characters/consistency_log.md</read>

if no consistency log exists:
  <create>
  <file>characters/consistency_log.md</file>
  <content>
  Character Consistency Log

  Use this log to track character details and maintain consistency.

  Format for each entry:
  DATE - CHARACTER - Detail noted

  Example:
  2024-01-15 - Protagonist - Established: allergic to peanuts
  2024-01-16 - Protagonist - Scene 3: almost ate peanut butter (caught)

  Quick Reference:
  - Physical traits

PHASE 1: THE CHARACTER FOUNDATION

every memorable character starts with a strong foundation.


the three pillars of character

  [1] WANT - what does the character consciously desire?
  [2] NEED - what does the character actually require (growth)?
  [3] FEAR - what prevents them from changing?

example from casablanca:

  Rick Blaine:
    WANT: to stay neutral and avoid involvement
    NEED: to re-engage with the world and fight for what's right
    FEAR: loss, vulnerability, getting hurt again

example from breaking bad:

  Walter White:
    WANT: to provide for his family before he dies
    NEED: to acknowledge his own ego and desire for power
    FEAR: being powerless, forgotten, ordinary


the character equation

  Memorable Character = Flaw + Desire + Contradiction

  flaw: what's wrong with them?
  desire: what do they want?
  contradiction: what makes them complex?

exercise: the three-sentence character

  write a character in exactly three sentences:

  [1] who they are and what they want
  [2] what flaw prevents them from getting it
  [3] what contradiction makes them interesting

  example:

    Elena is a brilliant forensic accountant who wants to expose
    the embezzlement scheme at her firm. Her perfectionism makes her
    incapable of letting anything go, even when putting herself in danger.
    Despite her obsession with truth, she keeps her own past as a
    convicted hacker hidden from everyone.

  your turn:
    [create your own three-sentence character]


PHASE 2: CHARACTER ARCHETYPES AND SUBVERSIONS


archetypes as starting points

  use archetypes as foundations, not finished buildings.

  common archetypes:

  the hero
    - wants to save/achieve something
    - willing to sacrifice
    - often reluctant at first
    - example: luke skywalker, harry potter, katniss everdeen

  the mentor
    - guides the hero
    - has wisdom from experience
    - often has a tragic past
    - example: gandalf, dumbledore, haymitch

  the threshold guardian
    - tests the hero before the real journey
    - may become an ally
    - example: stormtroopers, sorting hat, peacekeepers

  the shapeshifter
    - loyalty is unclear
    - may switch sides
    - creates tension
    - example: han solo, snape, finnick

  the shadow
    - represents the hero's dark potential
    - wants what the hero wants, for wrong reasons
    - example: vader, voldemort, snow

  the trickster
    - brings chaos and humor
    - challenges assumptions
    - example: r2-d2, fred/george weasley, haymitch


subverting archetypes

  memorable characters often start familiar then surprise us.

  han solo starts as greedy mercenary (archetype)
  subversion: comes back to help (surprise)
  becomes more heroic than he appears

  severus snape starts as villain (archetype)
  subversion: protecting harry all along (surprise)
  becomes more complex than either hero or villain

  subversion techniques:

  [1] give the villain a noble motive
  [2] give the hero a selfish motive
  [3] make the mentor flawed
  [4] make the trickster wise
  [5] make the shadow sympathetic


exercise: archetype twist

  choose an archetype and add three twists:

  archetype: [your choice]

  twist 1: [unexpected trait]
  twist 2: [contradictory behavior]
  twist 3: [hidden motivation]

  example:

    archetype: the mentor

    twist 1: he's younger than the hero
    twist 2: he's learning from the hero, not teaching
    twist 3: his "wisdom" comes from a future version of himself

  your turn:
    [create your own twisted archetype]


PHASE 3: THE CHARACTER QUESTIONNAIRE

  </create>


PHASE 4: CHARACTER VOICE AND SPEECH


what is character voice?

  voice is how a character sounds in their head and out loud.
  it includes vocabulary, rhythm, tone, and thought patterns.

  voice components:

  [1] word choice - what words do they use?
  [2] sentence structure - how do they build thoughts?
  [3] speech patterns - hesitations, repetitions, fillers
  [4] metaphors - what do they compare things to?
  [5] humor - what do they find funny?
  [6] formality - how do they address others?


developing distinctive voices

  character A (formal, educated):
    "I fail to comprehend the necessity of such precipitous action.
     Perhaps we might examine the alternatives before proceeding."

  character B (casual, direct):
    "I don't get why we're rushing. Can't we think about this first?"

  character C (tentative, anxious):
    "I mean, I'm not sure, but maybe... could we... um, maybe
     think about it? Before we do anything?"

  same meaning, three different voices.


voice exercise: the same scene, three characters

  scenario: someone just spilled coffee on their shirt.

  write how three different characters would react:

  character 1: [voice description]
    reaction: [what they say]

  character 2: [voice description]
    reaction: [what they say]

  character 3: [voice description]
    reaction: [what they say]


speech patterns to consider

  verbal tics:
    [ ] filler words (like, um, you know)
    [ ] repeated phrases
    [ ] sentence starters
    [ ] ways of saying yes/no

  grammar choices:
    [ ] complete sentences vs fragments
    [ ] formal vs casual grammar
    [ ] slang usage
    [ ] technical jargon

  rhythm:
    [ ] fast talker vs slow thinker
    [ ] interrupts often or listens carefully
    [ ] pauses before speaking or blurts immediately
    [ ] long explanations vs short answers


PHASE 5: CHARACTER ARC STRUCTURE


what is a character arc?

  a character arc is the internal journey a character takes.
  it parallels and often drives the external plot.

  three types of arcs:

  [1] positive arc - character grows and changes
  [2] negative arc - character falls and degrades
  [3] flat arc - character's beliefs are tested but confirmed


the positive arc (growth)

  structure:

  beginning: character believes a lie
    - "I'm not good enough"
    - "I don't need anyone"
    - "The world is fair"

  middle: character is tested
    - lie is challenged
    - character resists change
    - crisis forces confrontation

  end: character believes truth
    - "I am enough"
    - "I need connection"
    - "The world is unjust but I can fight"

  example: a christmas carol

  beginning: scrooge believes money = success, people = burdens
  middle: ghosts show him the truth, he resists
  end: scrooge believes connection = success, people = joy


the negative arc (fall)

  structure:

  beginning: character has a flaw but some goodness
  middle: character chooses the flaw repeatedly
  end: character is consumed by flaw

  example: breaking bad (walt)

  beginning: flawed but sympathetic, trying to provide
  middle: chooses pride/ego over family repeatedly
  end: completely consumed, loses everything that mattered


the flat arc (conviction)

  structure:

  beginning: character knows the truth
  middle: world challenges the truth
  end: character's conviction is strengthened

  example: wonder woman (diana)

  beginning: knows love is the answer
  middle: war and humanity test this belief
  end: still believes, but understands complexity


exercise: map your character's arc

  for your protagonist, map:

  [ ] starting belief/lie:
  [ ] inciting incident that challenges it:
  [ ] midpoint confrontation:
  [ ] low point (all seems lost):
  [ ] climax choice (truth or lie):
  [ ] ending belief/truth:

  <create>
  <file>characters/[name]_arc.md</file>
  <content>
  # Character Arc: [NAME]

  ## Starting State
  Believes: [LIE they believe]
  Because of: [backstory wound]
  Consequence: [how this limits them]

  ## Arc Journey
  Inciting Incident:
    - what happens:
    - how it challenges the lie:

  First Test:
    - what happens:
    - character's reaction:

  Midpoint:
    - major challenge:
    - character's choice:

  Low Point:
    - crisis moment:
    - character's rock bottom:

  Climax:
    - final choice:
    - truth acknowledged:

  ## Ending State
  Believes: [TRUTH they now accept]
  Changed: [how are they different]
  Cost of change: [what did they lose/gain]
  </content>
  </create>


PHASE 6: MOTIVATION AND GOALS


layers of motivation

  motivation operates on multiple levels.

  surface motivation (conscious):
    - what character says they want
    - immediate, visible goals

  deep motivation (subconscious):
    - what character actually needs
    - emotional fulfillment

  core motivation (fundamental):
    - universal human need
    - drives all behavior

  example: lord of the rings (frodo)

  surface: destroy the ring
  deep: prove his worth, protect the shire
  core: the need for purpose, to matter


the motivation hierarchy

  abraham maslow's hierarchy applied to characters:

  [1] physiological - food, shelter, survival
  [2] safety - security, stability
  [3] love/belonging - connection, acceptance
  [4] esteem - respect, status, achievement
  [5] self-actualization - fulfillment, purpose

  where is your character on this hierarchy?
  what level represents their primary motivation?

  example: the hunger games (katniss)

  story starts at level 1 (survival)
  moves to level 2 (safety of family)
  then level 3 (connection with peeta/rue)
  reaches level 5 (purpose: revolution)


conflicting motivations

  compelling characters have conflicting desires.

  internal conflicts:
    - want vs need
    - desire vs morality
    - ambition vs love
    - safety vs freedom
    - truth vs comfort

  example: hamlet

  want: revenge for his father
  need: to find peace/justice
  conflict: violence vs morality, action vs inaction

  exercise: identify two conflicting motivations for your character

  character: [name]

  motivation A: [what they consciously want]
  motivation B: [what competes with it]

  scene where both are active:
    [describe a moment where the conflict plays out]


goal structure

  goals should be:
  [1] specific - clear and defined
  [2] measurable - character knows when achieved
  [3] difficult - requires struggle
  [4] time-bound - has urgency

  goals operate at three scales:

  story goal (entire narrative):
    - what drives the plot
    - "destroy the ring"

  scene goal (individual moments):
    - what character wants in each interaction
    - "get gandalf to explain the ring"

  immediate physical goal (right now):
    - tactical objective
    - "hide from the ringwraiths"


exercise: goal hierarchy

  for your protagonist:

  story goal:
    [ ] what do they want by the end?
    [ ] why do they want it?
    [ ] what happens if they fail?

  scene goals (first three scenes):
    scene 1: [ ]
    scene 2: [ ]
    scene 3: [ ]


PHASE 7: BACKSTORY AND WOUNDS


the backstory principle

  backstory is everything that happened before page one.
  it explains WHY the character is who they are.

  key rule:
  backstory should be revealed ONLY when relevant to the present.

  [x] dumping backstory in chapter one
  [ok] revealing backstory when it explains current behavior

  the iceberg principle:
  - show 10% of backstory in the story
  - know 90% to create consistency


the ghost (defining wound)

  every compelling character has a ghost:
  a past trauma that haunts them and drives their behavior.

  ghost examples:

  batman: parents murdered in alley
    - creates need for control/justice
    - creates inability to trust
    - creates obsession with preparation

  harry potter: orphaned, parents murdered
    - creates need for family/belonging
    - creates identification with underdogs
    - creates willingness to sacrifice

  indiana jones: relationship with father
    - creates distance from others
    - creates competition/need to prove
    - creates fear of vulnerability


finding the ghost

  ask for your character:

  [ ] what's the worst thing that ever happened to them?
  [ ] what do they refuse to talk about?
  [ ] what memory keeps them awake at night?
  [ ] what would they erase if they could?
  [ ] what are they most ashamed of?

  exercise: write the ghost scene

  write the moment your character's wound occurred.

  <create>
  <file>characters/[name]_ghost.md</file>
  <content>
  # The Ghost: [CHARACTER NAME]

  ## The Wound
  What happened: [brief description]
  When: [age, time period]
  Who was involved: [other characters present]

  ## The Impact
  How it changed their belief about the world:
    Before: [what they believed]
    After: [what they now believe]

  How it changed their behavior:
    [new behaviors, defenses, coping mechanisms]

  ## The Scene
  [write the actual scene in detail, showing the wound as it happens]

  ## The Resonance
  How does this ghost affect current story events?
    [connect past wound to present conflicts]
  </content>
  </create>


backstory integration techniques

  [1] dialogue - character references past in conversation
  [2] triggered response - present event triggers past memory
  [3] physical reminder - object, place, person from past
  [4] behavior explanation - current behavior reveals past cause
  [5] confession - character deliberately reveals past
  [6] discovery - another character uncovers the past

  example: triggered response

  present: character sees someone drop a glass
  trigger: reminds them of an accident
  revealed: backstory about responsibility/guilt


PHASE 8: CHARACTER RELATIONSHIPS


the relationship web

  characters don't exist in isolation.
  each character is defined by their connections to others.

  relationship types:

  [1] primary - protagonist's main relationships
  [2] secondary - important but less central
  [3] tertiary - background relationships
  [4] opposition - antagonistic forces
  [5] mentorship - teaching/learning relationships
  [6] romance - love in all forms
  [7] family - blood and chosen
  [8] friendship - companionship and loyalty


relationship dynamics

  each relationship has a dynamic:

  complementary:
    - characters complete each other
    - strengths cover weaknesses
    - example: holmes and watson

  parallel:
    - characters mirror each other
    - similarities highlight differences
    - example: batman and joker

  transformational:
    - characters change each other
    - growth through relationship
    - example: elizabeth and darcy

  destructive:
    - characters bring out worst in each other
    - toxicity and codependency
    - example: macbeth and lady macbeth


relationship development

  relationships follow arcs too:

  beginning: establish baseline
    - how do characters start?
    - what's their initial dynamic?

  middle: challenges and growth
    - what tests the relationship?
    - how do they respond?
    - do they grow closer or further apart?

  end: transformed state
    - how has the relationship changed?
    - what's the new normal?

  exercise: map a key relationship

  characters: [A] and [B]

  starting dynamic:
    [how do they begin?]

  inciting incident for relationship:
    [what event tests them?]

  midpoint shift:
    [how does the relationship change?]

  crisis:
    [what nearly breaks them?]

  resolution:
    [what's their ending state?]


relationship chemistry

  what makes characters spark?

  [1] complementary traits - opposites attract
  [2] shared history - known each other long
  [3] shared trauma - bonded by experience
  [4] shared goal - united by purpose
  [5] intellectual match - stimulate each other
  [6] emotional resonance - understand each other
  [7] conflict - tension creates interest

  writing chemistry exercise:

  write a scene where two characters meet.
  focus on:
    - what draws them together?
    - what pushes them apart?
    - what makes them interesting together?

  <create>
  <file>characters/[name]_and_[name]_relationship.md</file>
  <content>
  # Relationship: [CHARACTER A] & [CHARACTER B]

  ## Dynamic
    Type: [romantic/familial/friendly/antagonistic/mentoral]
    Pattern: [complementary/parallel/transformational/destructive]
    Chemistry source: [what connects them]

  ## Arc
  Beginning:
    [starting state, first impressions]

  Turning Points:
    [key moments that changed the relationship]

  Ending:
    [final state, how they've changed]

  ## Key Scenes
  [list important scenes for this relationship]
  </content>
  </create>


PHASE 9: FLAWS AND VIRTUES


the flaw system

  flaws are what make characters human.
  perfect characters are boring.

  flaw categories:

  [1] minor flaws - annoying but not destructive
    examples: chronic lateness, bad jokes, messy, forgetful

  [2] major flaws - serious problems for self and others
    examples: arrogance, cowardice, greed, jealousy

  [3] fatal flaws - will lead to downfall without change
    examples: pride, obsession, inability to trust

  a good main character has all three types.


the virtue trap

  virtues taken too far become flaws.

  loyalty -> tribalism, blind following
  confidence -> arrogance, dismissing others
  honesty -> cruelty, lack of tact
  ambition -> ruthlessness, moral compromise
  love -> jealousy, control, smothering

  exercise: flip a virtue

  character's greatest strength: [virtue]

  how it becomes a flaw:
    [describe the shadow side]

  example scene:
    [write a moment where this trait causes problems]


flaw consequences

  flaws must have real consequences.

  in-scene consequences:
    - causes immediate problems
    - damages relationships
    - creates complications

  story consequences:
    - drives the conflict
    - prevents goal achievement
    - requires change to overcome

  exercise: consequence chain

  character's flaw: [ ]

  immediate consequences:
    [ ] [scene 1 consequence]
    [ ] [scene 2 consequence]
    [ ] [scene 3 consequence]

  ultimate consequence if unchanged:
    [ ] [what happens if they never change?]


redemption and growth

  flaws can be overcome.

  redemption paths:

  [1] recognition - character sees the flaw
  [2] remorse - character feels the damage
  [3] resistance - character tries to change but fails
  [4] resolve - character commits to change
  [5] recurrence - flaw returns under stress
  [6] resolution - character chooses differently

  example: arc with recurrence

  character recognizes flaw: act 1
  character tries to change: act 2
  flaw returns under pressure: act 2 climax
  character finally chooses better: act 3 climax

  this feels more real than instant perfection.


PHASE 10: CHARACTER CONSISTENCY


the consistency problem

  characters must change through the arc
  but stay consistent to their nature.

  the paradox:
  - consistent characters don't change
  - changing characters aren't consistent

  solution: core traits stay consistent, behaviors evolve.


tracking consistency

  create a character style guide:

  [ ] speech patterns - how do they talk?
  [ ] decision patterns - how do they choose?
  [ ] emotional patterns - how do they feel/react?
  [ ] behavioral patterns - how do they act?
  [ ] moral boundaries - what lines won't they cross?

  exercise: create the style guide

  <create>
  <file>characters/[name]_style_guide.md</file>
  <content>
  # Character Style Guide: [NAME]

  ## Voice
  Vocabulary level: [formal/colloquial/technical/etc]
  Common phrases: ["exact quotes of things they say often"]
  Sentence structure: [long/complex/short/simple/etc]
  Filler words: [um, like, you know, etc]

  ## Behavior
  Under stress: [how they react when things go wrong]
  When happy: [how they express joy]
  When sad: [how they process sadness]
  When angry: [how they show anger]
  Decision-making: [impulsive/deliberate/emotional/logical]

  ## Morality
  Absolute lines: [what they will NEVER do]
  Flexible lines: [what they might do under pressure]
  Justified lines: [what they can rationalize doing]

  ## Habits
  Daily routines: [morning, evening, work patterns]
  Physical habits: [gestures, posture, movement]
  Mental habits: [worry patterns, planning, etc]

  ## Relationships
  With authority: [respectful/resistant/manipulative/etc]
  With peers: [friendly/distant/competitive/etc]
  With subordinates: [supportive/demanding/indifferent/etc]
  </content>
  </create>


consistency checking

  before writing a scene, ask:

  [ ] would this character say this?
  [ ] is this action consistent with their established nature?
  [ ] does this decision follow their motivation?
  [ ] does this emotional reaction fit their personality?
  [ ] am i making them do something for plot convenience?

  if answer is no:
  - either change the scene
  - or build justification (show WHY they act out of character)

  out-of-character moments need explanation:
  - extreme stress
  - major revelation
  - deliberate choice to change
  - manipulation/coercion


PHASE 11: MINOR CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT


the hierarchy of character depth

  not every character needs equal development.

  protagonist: full development
    - complete questionnaire
    - detailed arc
    - full backstory
    - complex relationships

  major supporting: significant development
    - key traits established
    - clear motivation
    - relationship to protagonist
    - mini-arc possible

  minor supporting: functional development
    - 2-3 clear traits
    - specific role in story
    - distinctive voice
    - relationship to plot

  background characters: minimal development
    - one memorable trait
    - clear function
    - distinctive detail if named


the rule of three for minor characters

  give minor characters three things:

  [1] one visual detail - how they look
  [2] one behavioral trait - how they act
  [3] one speech pattern - how they talk

  example:

  the bartender:
    visual: missing two fingers on left hand
    behavior: always polishing the same glass
    speech: ends every sentence with "eh?"

  instantly memorable. three details, done.


function over development for minor characters

  minor characters serve specific functions:

  [1] information delivery - give exposition naturally
  [2] obstacle creation - block or challenge protagonist
  [3] thematic reinforcement - embody story themes
  [4] worldbuilding - reveal setting details
  [5] comic relief - provide humor
  [6] contrast - highlight protagonist traits
  [7] catalyst - trigger important events

  identify the function first.
  develop only what serves that function.


exercise: minor character card

  create a card for each minor character:

  <create>
  <file>characters/minor_[name].md</file>
  <content>
  # Minor Character: [NAME]

  ## Function
  Role in story: [what do they do?]
  Scenes: [where do they appear?]

  ## Three Details
  Visual: [one memorable appearance detail]
  Behavior: [one characteristic action]
  Speech: [one distinctive way of talking]

  ## Relationship
  Connection to protagonist: [ ]
  Connection to plot: [ ]

  ## Exit
  How do they leave the story? [ ]
  </content>
  </create>


PHASE 12: CHARACTER DESCRIPTION AND INTRODUCTIONS


the introduction principle

  first impressions matter for characters too.
  the first time we meet a character should establish:
  - who they are
  - what they want
  - why they're interesting

  introduction techniques:

  [1] action - character doing something characteristic
  [2] dialogue - character speaking in their voice
  [3] reaction - character responding to a situation
  [4] appearance - visual description that reveals personality
  [5] reputation - others talking about them first
  [6] mystery - something that makes us ask questions


showing character through description

  descriptions should reveal, not just record.

  [x] "she was five-foot-six with brown hair and green eyes"
  [ok] "she had the compact toughness of a bantamweight,
        eyes that constantly scanned for threats, hair cut
        short because she had better things to do than style it"

  the first describes. the second reveals personality.


descriptive details that reveal character

  choose details that mean something:

  clothing:
    [ ] what do they choose to wear? (values, priorities)
    [ ] how do they wear it? (self-image, comfort)
    [ ] condition? (attention to detail, resources)

  body:
    [ ] build? (history, lifestyle, work)
    [ ] scars? (past trauma, experience)
    [ ] posture? (confidence, energy, attitude)
    [ ] movement? (energy, intent, mood)

  face:
    [ ] eyes? (age, emotion, focus)
    [ ] expressions? (default mood, openness)
    [ ] distinguishing features? (history, individuality)

  hands:
    [ ] condition? (work history, self-care)
    [ ] movement? (nervousness, confidence)

  requirements:
  [ ] show them in action
  [ ] establish their voice
  [ ] hint at their motivation
  [ ] include a revealing detail
  [ ] make the reader want to know more

  Draft: [write your introduction scene]

  Checklist:
  [ ] character in action
  [ ] voice established
  [ ] motivation hinted
  [ ] revealing detail included
  [ ] questions raised (why do we want to know more?)

PHASE 13: CHARACTER EMOTIONAL RANGE


the emotional spectrum

  characters should experience a full range of emotions.

  primary emotions:
    - joy, sadness, anger, fear, disgust, surprise

  secondary emotions:
    - shame, guilt, envy, jealousy, love, hate
    - pride, embarrassment, disappointment, relief
    - hope, despair, curiosity, boredom

  mixed emotions:
    - bittersweet (joy + sadness)
    - nervous excitement (fear + anticipation)
    - angry love (anger + affection)
    - confused relief (surprise + processing)


showing emotion

  emotions are shown through:

  [1] physical sensations
    - heart rate, breathing, temperature
    - muscle tension, shaking, sweating
    - stomach, chest, throat feelings

  [2] actions and behaviors
    - what characters do when emotional
    - conscious and unconscious actions
    - avoid clichés (clenched jaw, pounding fist)

  [3] thoughts
    - how emotions affect thinking
    - racing thoughts, blanking out
    - focus shifts, distraction

  [4] dialogue
    - tone, rhythm, word choice
    - what is said vs what isn't
    - subtext and hidden emotions

  [x] "she felt sad"
  [ok] "her chest hollowed out. she couldn't seem to draw
        a full breath. everything looked gray, like the
        world had been desaturated."


emotional consistency

  characters have emotional patterns:

  [ ] what emotions do they feel most often?
  [ ] what emotions do they avoid?
  [ ] what emotions are they comfortable expressing?
  [ ] what emotions do they suppress?
  [ ] how long do they hold onto emotions?
  [ ] what triggers each emotion?

  exercise: emotional profile

  create an emotional profile for your character:

  <create>
  <file>characters/[name]_emotions.md</file>
  <content>
  # Emotional Profile: [NAME]

  ## Baseline
  Default mood: [ ]
  Emotional range: [broad/narrow]
  Emotional intensity: [high/low/variable]

  ## Common Emotions
  Primary emotion: [what they feel most]
  Triggers: [what causes this emotion]
  Expression: [how they show it]

  ## Suppressed Emotions
  What they hide: [ ]
  How they hide it: [ ]
  What would make them lose control: [ ]

  ## Emotional Arc
  Starting emotional state: [ ]
  Emotional journey: [key emotional beats]
  Ending emotional state: [ ]
  </content>
  </create>


PHASE 14: CHARACTER DECISIONS AND AGENCY


character agency

  agency means characters make choices that drive the plot.
  things don't just happen TO them; they MAKE things happen.

  the agency test:
  - if your character were replaced with someone else,
    would the story unfold the same way?
  - if yes, they lack agency.

  giving characters agency:

  [1] active goals - they want something specific
  [2] difficult choices - they must decide between options
  [3] consequences - their choices matter
  [4] initiative - they act, not just react
  [5] competence - they have skills to affect outcome


decision types

  characters face different kinds of decisions:

  [1] tactical - immediate, in-scene choices
    "do i fight or run?"

  [2] strategic - long-term planning
    "how do i defeat the antagonist?"

  [3] moral - right vs wrong
    "do i sacrifice one to save many?"

  [4] emotional - heart vs head
    "do i follow love or duty?"

  [5] identity - who am i?
    "what kind of person do i choose to be?"


difficult choices

  good choices have:
  - real stakes (something important on the line)
  - real cost (any option has a price)
  - no obvious right answer (both options have merit)
  - character-specific (only this character would choose this)

  exercise: the impossible choice

  create a decision point for your character:

  choice A: [option 1]
    benefit: [ ]
    cost: [ ]

  choice B: [option 2]
    benefit: [ ]
    cost: [ ]

  what do they choose and why?
  [this reveals who they are]


consequences of choices

  choices must have consequences.

  [1] immediate - happens right away
  [2] ripple - affects other situations/characters
  [3] long-term - changes the story trajectory
  [4] character - affects how they see themselves

  tracking consequences:

  choice made: [what they decided]
  immediate consequence: [what happens next]
  ripple effects: [who else is affected]
  long-term impact: [how story changes]
  character impact: [how they change]


PHASE 15: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT CHECKLISTS


comprehensive character checklist

  for major characters, verify:

  foundation:
    [ ] clear want (conscious desire)
    [ ] clear need (unconscious growth requirement)
    [ ] clear fear (what blocks change)
    [ ] defining flaw (what's wrong with them)
    [ ] defining strength (what's right with them)
    [ ] ghost/wound (past trauma)
    [ ] contradiction (what doesn't fit)

  voice:
    [ ] distinctive vocabulary
    [ ] distinctive sentence structure
    [ ] distinctive speech patterns
    [ ] distinctive thought patterns
    [ ] figurative language preferences

  arc:
    [ ] starting belief/lie
    [ ] inciting incident
    [ ] midpoint shift
    [ ] low point
    [ ] climax choice
    [ ] ending truth

  relationships:
    [ ] connection to protagonist
    [ ] relationship arc
    [ ] distinctive dynamic

  consistency:
    [ ] style guide created
    [ ] patterns established
    [ ] boundaries defined


minor character checklist

  for minor characters, verify:

  [ ] clear story function
  [ ] one memorable visual detail
  [ ] one memorable behavior
  [ ] one memorable speech pattern
  [ ] clear relationship to protagonist/plot
  [ ] defined exit (if applicable)


scene-level character checklist

  before writing each scene, verify:

  [ ] what does each character want in this scene?
  [ ] how does this scene advance their arc?
  [ ] is their voice consistent?
  [ ] are their actions consistent?
  [ ] are they making choices (showing agency)?
  [ ] what do they learn/feel/change?

  after writing each scene, verify:

  [ ] could this scene be told by any other character?
    (if yes, voice needs work)
  [ ] would this character make this choice?
    (if no, justify or revise)
  [ ] is the emotion clear?
  [ ] is the subtext working?


character consistency pass

  after drafting, do a character pass:

  read one character's scenes only:
  [ ] is their voice consistent throughout?
  [ ] does their arc develop logically?
  [ ] are there any out-of-character moments?
  [ ] do their contradictions remain consistent?

  check relationships:
  [ ] do relationships develop properly?
  [ ] are interactions consistent with dynamics?
  [ ] are off-screen relationships implied effectively?

  check growth:
  [ ] is change earned?
  [ ] are steps skipped?
  [ ] is regression consistent with stress?


PHASE 16: AVOIDING STEREOTYPES AND CLICHÉS


recognizing stereotypes

  stereotypes are lazy characterization.

  common stereotypes to avoid:

  [x] the wise old mentor with white beard
  [x] the evil henchman who's just following orders
  [x] the strong female character who's just "one of the boys"
  [x] the brilliant but socially awkward genius
  [x] the tough guy with a heart of gold
  [x] the femme fatale with no motivation beyond being sexy
  [x] the chosen one who's special for no reason
  [x] the noble savage
  [x] the magical minority
  [x] the sassy best friend

  if a character fits a known pattern, subvert it.


from stereotype to human

  transformation process:

  [1] identify the stereotype
  [2] add complexity (contradictions)
  [3] add specific history
  [4] add personal motivation
  [5] add agency and choice
  [6] add flaws

  example: from wise mentor to human

  stereotype: old, wise, perfect guide

  human version:
    - makes mistakes and admits them
    - has personal stake in outcome
    - is wrong about some things
    - learns from the hero too
    - has a life beyond the hero
    - carries regret/guilt


diversity and representation

  write characters different from you with respect.

  guidelines:

  [1] do the research
    - understand the culture/experience
    - talk to people from that background
    - read works by authors from that background

  [2] avoid single stories
    - no group is monolithic
    - individuals vary within groups
    - show multiple perspectives from same group

  [3] focus on humanity first
    - universal experiences connect us
    - specificity creates authenticity
    - avoid tourism or fetishization

  [4] get sensitivity readers
    - have people from that background read
    - listen to feedback
    - be willing to make changes


PHASE 17: CHARACTER EXERCISES AND PROMPTS


warm-up exercises

  exercise 1: the character interview

  interview your character as if for a magazine.

  questions:
    - what's your greatest accomplishment?
    - what's your biggest regret?
    - what do you want most that you don't have?
    - what would you change about yourself?
    - what's the hardest thing you've ever done?
    - who do you love most?
    - what are you most afraid of?
    - how do you want to be remembered?

  write their answers in their voice.


exercise 2: the letter

  have your character write a letter they'll never send.

  to whom: [someone important to them]

  topic: [what do they need to say but can't?]

  write the letter in their voice, revealing things they'd
  never say aloud.


exercise 3: the worst day

  write about your character's worst day ever.

  show:
    - what happened
    - how they reacted
    - what it changed in them
    - how it still affects them

  this reveals their breaking point and recovery mechanisms.


deep development exercises

  exercise 4: the character doppelganger

  create a version of your character who made one
  different choice at a crucial moment.

  your character: [name]
  the choice: [what decision defined them]
  alternate choice: [what if they chose differently]

  write a scene with both versions meeting.
  how are they different? how are they the same?


exercise 5: the prequel scene

  write a scene from your character's past that
  explains something about their present behavior.

  present behavior: [something they do now]
  past cause: [what made them this way]

  write the scene when it happened.


exercise 6: the future scene

  write your character ten years after the story ends.

  - where are they?
  - who are they with?
  - what did the story change?
  - what stayed the same?

  this forces you to understand the long-term impact
  of their arc.


relationship exercises

  exercise 7: the relationship first meeting

  write the scene where two important characters first met.

  - how were they different then?
  - what was their first impression?
  - what about each other did they notice first?
  - how did they establish their dynamic?


exercise 8: the relationship argument

  write an argument between two characters.

  - what are they really fighting about?
  - what are they pretending to fight about?
  - what does this reveal about their dynamic?
  - what doesn't get said that matters?


exercise 9: the relationship reconciliation

  if two characters have a falling out, write their makeup.

  - who apologizes first?
  - what concessions are made?
  - what's unresolved?
  - is their relationship changed forever?


PHASE 18: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT RULES (STRICT MODE)


while this skill is active, these rules are MANDATORY:

  [1] EVERY character must want something
      if you don't know what they want, you don't know the character
      want = visible goal that drives their actions

  [2] MAIN characters must have arcs
      arc = internal change from belief in lie to acceptance of truth
      if they don't change, they're not the protagonist

  [3] NEVER make characters do things for plot convenience
      actions must flow from established character
      if plot requires action out of character, change the plot

  [4] ALWAYS know more about character than appears on page
      iceberg principle: show 10%, know 90%
      this depth creates consistency readers feel

  [5] CHARACTER voice must be distinctive
      if dialogue isn't tagged, reader should know who's speaking
      if characters sound alike, rewrite until different

  [6] FLAWS are more interesting than virtues
      perfect characters are boring
      give everyone something wrong with them

  [7] BACKSTORY is revealed only when relevant to present
      never info-dump character history
      reveal past when it explains current behavior

  [8] RELATIONSHIPS define characters as much as individual traits
      who characters are connected to matters
      relationships must have arcs too

  [9] MINOR characters get three details max
      one visual, one behavioral, one speech
      anything more is wasted wordcount

  [10] CONSISTENCY is more important than likability
        characters can be unlikable but must be consistent
        inconsistency breaks reader trust


PHASE 19: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT SESSION CHECKLIST


before starting a story:

  [ ] character bible created
  [ ] protagonist fully developed
  [ ] antagonist fully developed
  [ ] major supporting characters developed
  [ ] relationship web mapped
  [ ] arcs established for all major characters
  [ ] style guides created
  [ ] consistency log ready


for each character created:

  [ ] foundational questionnaire complete
  [ ] want/need/fear identified
  [ ] ghost/wound established
  [ ] voice developed
  [ ] arc mapped
  [ ] relationships defined
  [ ] flaws and virtues balanced
  [ ] consistency tracked


before writing each scene:

  [ ] what does each character want in this scene?
  [ ] how does this scene advance their arc?
  [ ] is their voice clear?
  [ ] are their actions consistent?
  [ ] what do they learn/feel/change?


after completing a draft:

  [ ] do a character consistency pass
  [ ] verify all arcs resolve
  [ ] check relationship development
  [ ] remove/merge underdeveloped characters
  [ ] deepen minor characters if needed
  [ ] fix all voice inconsistencies


FINAL REMINDERS


characters are why we read

we don't remember plots. we remember people.
scarlett o'hara, not the civil war.
holden caulfield, not boarding school.
harry potter, not the defeat of voldemort.

invest in your characters and readers will invest in your story.


specificity creates authenticity

the more specific your character, the more real they feel.
not "she liked music" but "she played bach cello suites
when she couldn't sleep, the same recording since she was
twelve, because it was the only thing that made the
monsters under the bed go away."

specific details. universal emotions.


contradiction creates depth

real people are contradictions.
your characters should be too.

the pacifist who enjoys violent video games.
the thief who always returns what he steals.
the atheist who prays when the plane shakes.

we're all hypocrites. your characters should be too.


empathy over likability

readers don't have to like your characters.
they have to care what happens to them.

likable = pleasant, agreeable, nice
compelling = complex, human, worthy of attention

you can write terrible people. just make them human.


when in doubt

go deeper.

what are they afraid of?
what do they want?
what do they need?
what hurt them?
what are they hiding?
what do they believe that isn't true?

answer those questions and you'll find your character.

now go create someone worth following.
