# Asset Management Framework

## Overview
This document establishes a comprehensive framework for managing all digital assets within the Chat App project, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and efficient utilization of visual resources.

## Asset Categories

### 1. Visual Assets
- **Images**: Screenshots, icons, illustrations, mockups
- **Diagrams**: Architecture diagrams, flowcharts, system designs
- **Templates**: Reusable design components, document templates

### 2. Documentation Assets
- **Specifications**: Technical specifications, API documentation
- **Standards**: Design standards, coding standards, process standards
- **Templates**: Project templates, documentation templates

## Asset Organization Structure

## Asset Management Best Practices

### Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, consistent naming patterns
- Include version numbers for iterative assets
- Use lowercase with hyphens: `user-flow-diagram-v2.png`
- Include creation date for time-sensitive assets: `mockup-dashboard-2025-01-15.png`

### Version Control
- Track asset versions using semantic versioning
- Maintain change logs for significant asset updates
- Archive outdated versions in dedicated folders
- Link asset versions to corresponding code releases

### Quality Standards
- Maintain high resolution for all images (minimum 300 DPI for print)
- Use consistent color schemes aligned with brand guidelines
- Ensure accessibility compliance for all visual content
- Optimize file sizes for web delivery

### Access Management
- Define clear ownership and responsibility for asset categories
- Establish approval workflows for asset modifications
- Document asset dependencies and relationships
- Maintain asset inventories with metadata

## AI-Assisted Asset Development

### Claude Code Integration
- Use Claude Code for automated asset generation workflows
- Implement template-driven asset creation processes
- Leverage AI for asset optimization and quality checks
- Automate asset documentation and cataloging

### Spec-Driven Asset Creation
- Define clear specifications before asset creation
- Use standardized templates for consistent output
- Document asset requirements and acceptance criteria
- Implement review processes for spec compliance

## Maintenance and Governance

### Regular Audits
- Quarterly asset inventory reviews
- Identify unused or outdated assets
- Update asset metadata and documentation
- Validate asset accessibility and compliance

### Workflow Integration
- Integrate asset management with development workflows
- Automate asset deployment and distribution
- Establish asset backup and recovery procedures
- Monitor asset usage and performance metrics

## Tools and Technologies

### Recommended Tools
- **Version Control**: Git LFS for large assets
- **Image Optimization**: ImageOptim, TinyPNG
- **Diagram Creation**: Mermaid, PlantUML, Draw.io
- **Asset Management**: Digital Asset Management (DAM) systems

### Integration Points
- CI/CD pipeline integration for asset deployment
- Documentation system integration for asset references
- Development environment integration for asset access
- Quality assurance integration for asset validation

## Metrics and KPIs

### Asset Utilization
- Asset usage frequency and patterns
- Asset creation and modification rates
- Storage optimization metrics
- Access and download statistics

### Quality Metrics
- Asset compliance with standards
- User satisfaction with asset quality
- Asset lifecycle management efficiency
- Documentation completeness scores
