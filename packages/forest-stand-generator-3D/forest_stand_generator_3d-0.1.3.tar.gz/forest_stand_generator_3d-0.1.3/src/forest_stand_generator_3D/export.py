    Export a forest stand to a JSON file.

    The file is written to the current working directory unless
    a path is explicitly included in the filename.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stand : list
        Forest stand data structure.
        Each element represents a tree and contains:
            - trunk: base position, height, radius
            - leaves: list of leaf objects with center, radius, and normal
    filename : str
        Name of the output JSON file (e.g. "forest_stand.json").

    Notes
    -----
    NumPy arrays inside the stand structure are automatically
    converted to standard Python lists.

def export_forest_stand_to_csv(stand: list, filename: str):
    """
    Export forest stand geometry to a CSV file.

    Each row represents either a trunk or a leaf.

    CSV Columns
    -----------
    tree_id : int
        Index of the tree in the forest stand.
    type : str
        Either "trunk" or "leaf".
    x, y, z : float
        Spatial coordinates.
        - Trunk: base position
        - Leaf: center position
    radius : float
        Radius of the trunk or leaf.
    nx, ny, nz : float
        Normal vector of the leaf.
        Set to (0, 0, 0) for trunks.

    Parameters
    ----------
    stand : list
        Forest stand data structure.
    filename : str
        Name of the output CSV file (e.g. "forest_stand.csv").

    Notes
    -----
    Trunks are exported as a single point located at the trunk base.
    Leaf geometry is represented by its center, radius, and normal.
