    """
    Generate a forest stand (collection of trees) on a rectangular plot.

    Parameters
    ----------
    plot_width : float
        Width of the rectangular plot (x-direction, in meters or desired units).
    plot_length : float
        Length of the rectangular plot (y-direction, in meters or desired units).
    n_trees : int
        Total number of trees to generate.
    placement : str
        Placement strategy for trees. Options:
        - "uniform": trees are placed on a regular grid. Grid spacing is validated
          to ensure that tree trunk circles on the ground do not intersect.
        - "random": trees are placed randomly while enforcing minimum spacing
          between trunk centers and preventing trunk overlap.
    min_spacing : float
        Minimum allowed distance between tree centers when placement="random".
        The actual enforced distance between two trees is:
            max(min_spacing, r1 + r2),
        where r1 and r2 are the trunk radii of the two trees.
        Ignored when placement="uniform".
    tree_params : dict or list of dict
        Parameters for tree generation, passed to `generate_tree`.
        - dict: the same parameters are applied to all trees.
        - list of dicts: a separate parameter set for each tree.
          Length must equal n_trees.

    Returns
    -------
    List[Dict]
        List of tree dictionaries. Each dictionary represents a generated tree
        with its spatial position and structural attributes.

    Notes
    -----
    - Tree positions represent the center of the trunk at ground level
      (x, y, z = 0.0).
    - For both placement modes, tree trunk circles on the ground are guaranteed
      not to intersect.
    - For "uniform" placement, a ValueError is raised if the plot is too small
      to accommodate all trees without trunk overlap.
    - For "random" placement, if the requested number of trees cannot be placed
      due to spacing constraints, fewer trees may be generated and a warning
      is printed.
