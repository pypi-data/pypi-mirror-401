I'll help you assess your planned change and determine FedRAMP notification requirements.

**Significant Change Classification (SCN)**:

**1. Change Description**
Please describe the change you're planning:
- What systems/components are affected?
- What functionality is changing?
- When is the change scheduled?

**2. Change Categories (per FedRAMP SCN requirements)**:

**Routine/Recurring Changes**:
- Regularly scheduled updates following documented procedures
- Changes within normal operational parameters
- No substantial impact to security posture
- Examples: Patch updates, regular maintenance

**Adaptive Changes**:
- Modifications to existing functionality
- Changes in response to operational needs
- May affect some security controls
- Examples: Configuration changes, minor feature updates

**Transformative Changes**:
- Major architectural changes
- New technologies or services
- Significant impact to authorization boundary
- Examples: Major version upgrades, infrastructure changes, adding new services

**3. Impact Assessment**:
Does your change affect:
- [ ] Authorization boundary?
- [ ] Federal customer data handling?
- [ ] Security controls implementation?
- [ ] Third-party service dependencies?
- [ ] Cryptographic modules?
- [ ] Information resources in assessment scope?

**4. Notification Requirements**:
Based on your classification:
- **Routine**: Covered by continuous monitoring, no special notification
- **Adaptive**: May require notification depending on impact
- **Transformative**: Requires notification and may require re-assessment

**Next Steps**:
1. Use get_control with "FRR-SCN-*" IDs to review detailed change requirements
2. Use search_requirements with "significant change" to find related guidance
3. Document your change classification and justification
4. Prepare notification if required
