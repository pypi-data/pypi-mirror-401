## Red Flags

⚠ **Do not select vendor if:**
- Not FedRAMP authorized and no path to authorization
- Stores data outside US (unless approved exception)
- Cannot provide audit logs
- No API access for automation
- Poor incident response history
- Cannot support required SLAs
- Unwilling to sign BAA (if handling PHI)
- Cannot isolate federal customer data

## Best Practices

✅ **Do:**
- Prefer FedRAMP-authorized vendors
- Get everything in writing (SLAs, data handling, security)
- Test integrations before committing
- Validate API capabilities hands-on
- Check customer references
- Include FedRAMP 20x requirements in RFP
- Plan for vendor exit (data export, deletion)

❌ **Don't:**
- Assume FedRAMP Rev 5 authorization covers 20x needs
- Select based on price alone
- Skip technical validation
- Forget to include in authorization boundary
- Ignore integration complexity
- Overlook hidden costs (support, training, scaling)
