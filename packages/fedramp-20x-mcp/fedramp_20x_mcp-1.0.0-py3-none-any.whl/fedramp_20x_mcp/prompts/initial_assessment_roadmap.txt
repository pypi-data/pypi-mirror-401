I'll provide a comprehensive roadmap for starting your FedRAMP 20x authorization from scratch.

# FedRAMP 20x Initial Assessment Roadmap

**Important Note on OSCAL:** FedRAMP 20x requires **machine-readable** formats (JSON, XML, or structured data) for Authorization Data Sharing (FRR-ADS). **OSCAL is NOT mentioned in FedRAMP 20x requirements** - it's a NIST standard that can be used as one implementation approach. When you see "OSCAL" mentioned below, understand it's one option among custom JSON/XML formats. Choose based on your implementation needs.

## Phase 1: Foundation

**Understanding & Planning**
- [ ] Review all FedRAMP 20x standards (use list_family_controls for each)
- [ ] Identify your authorization level (Low, Moderate, High)
- [ ] Determine service categorization (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS)
- [ ] Assemble core team (CISO, compliance PM, engineering lead)
- [ ] Budget for 3PAO, tools, and staff time

**Initial Scoping**
- [ ] Define authorization boundary (FRR-MAS)
- [ ] Inventory all information resources
- [ ] Document Federal Customer Data flows
- [ ] Identify third-party dependencies
- [ ] Review FRD definitions for terminology

**Deliverables**: Authorization boundary diagram, resource inventory, project charter

## Phase 2: Infrastructure & Tools

**Security Monitoring**
- [ ] Select and deploy SIEM solution (KSI-MLA-01)
- [ ] Configure log forwarding from all systems
- [ ] Set up vulnerability scanning (FRR-VDR-01)
- [ ] Implement container/code scanning
- [ ] Configure alerting and dashboards

**Identity & Access**
- [ ] Implement phishing-resistant MFA (KSI-IAM-01)
- [ ] Configure least-privilege IAM (KSI-IAM-05)
- [ ] Set up identity provider integration
- [ ] Document access procedures

**Automation Foundation**
- [ ] Implement Infrastructure as Code (KSI-MLA-05)
- [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines (KSI-CMT-03)
- [ ] Configure automated testing
- [ ] Implement secret management (KSI-SVC-06)

**Deliverables**: Operational SIEM, vulnerability scanning, MFA, IaC

## Phase 3: Compliance Infrastructure

**KSI Tracking**
- [ ] Review all 72 KSIs (use list_ksi)
- [ ] Map KSIs to your monitoring systems
- [ ] Implement automated KSI collection
- [ ] Create KSI dashboards
- [ ] Document collection procedures

**Authorization Data Sharing API**
- [ ] Design API endpoints (FRR-ADS)
- [ ] Implement machine-readable format (custom JSON/XML or OSCAL)
- [ ] Configure authentication (OAuth 2.0 or mTLS)
- [ ] Integrate with data sources
- [ ] Test with sample queries

**Continuous Monitoring Setup**
- [ ] Document quarterly review process (FRR-CCM-QR)
- [ ] Set up continuous vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Configure persistent validation (FRR-PVA)
- [ ] Establish agency collaboration procedures

**Deliverables**: KSI collection system, Data Sharing API, ConMon procedures

## Phase 4: Documentation

**Core Documentation**
- [ ] System Security Plan (OSCAL format)
- [ ] Vulnerability Detection & Response procedures (FRR-VDR)
- [ ] Incident Communications Procedures (FRR-ICP)
- [ ] Significant Change Notification procedures (FRR-SCN)
- [ ] All 72 KSI implementation descriptions

**Policies & Procedures**
- [ ] Security policies aligned to FedRAMP 20x
- [ ] Change management procedures (KSI-CMT-04)
- [ ] Incident response plan (KSI-INR-01)
- [ ] Backup and recovery plan (KSI-RPL-02)
- [ ] Training programs (KSI-CED)

**Evidence Collection**
- [ ] Configure automated evidence collection
- [ ] Validate all KSI metrics are being tracked
- [ ] Test Authorization Data Sharing API
- [ ] Generate sample quarterly reports
- [ ] Document evidence collection procedures

**Deliverables**: Complete SSP, all policies/procedures, evidence collection system

## Phase 5: Assessment Preparation

**Internal Readiness**
- [ ] Internal security assessment
- [ ] Gap remediation
- [ ] Evidence validation
- [ ] Practice runs with team
- [ ] Documentation review

**3PAO Selection & Engagement**
- [ ] Select 3PAO assessor
- [ ] Kickoff meeting
- [ ] Provide documentation
- [ ] Schedule assessment

**Assessment**
- [ ] 3PAO conducts assessment
- [ ] Daily standups with assessor
- [ ] Address findings in real-time
- [ ] Document any deviations

**Deliverables**: Security Assessment Report (SAR)

## Phase 6: Authorization

**POA&M Development**
- [ ] Document all findings
- [ ] Create remediation plans
- [ ] Assign ownership and timelines
- [ ] Get executive approval

**Package Submission**
- [ ] Compile complete ATO package
- [ ] Submit to agency/FedRAMP
- [ ] Respond to initial questions

**Authorization Review**
- [ ] Agency/FedRAMP reviews package
- [ ] Respond to questions
- [ ] Provide additional evidence
- [ ] Receive Authorization decision

**Deliverables**: Authorization to Operate (ATO)

## Ongoing: Continuous Monitoring (Post-Authorization)

**Daily/Automated**
- Vulnerability scanning
- Log collection and analysis
- KSI metric collection
- Change tracking

**Monthly**
- Review vulnerability findings
- Update POA&Ms
- Security control validation

**Quarterly (FRR-CCM-QR)**
- Formal quarterly review
- Update authorization package
- Share data via API
- Agency coordination

**Annual**
- Update authorization boundary
- Review significant changes
- Update risk assessment
- Plan for re-assessment

## Critical Success Factors

**1. Executive Support** (KSI-PIY-08)
- Secure budget and resources
- Get organizational buy-in
- Ensure priority status

**2. Automation First** (FRD-ALL-07: "automatically if possible")
- Automate evidence collection
- Use IaC for all infrastructure
- Implement CI/CD pipelines
- Automated compliance checking

**3. Team Skills**
- FedRAMP 20x knowledge
- Cloud-native expertise
- Security automation skills
- OSCAL format understanding

**4. Vendor Selection**
- Choose FedRAMP-ready tools
- Ensure API integration capabilities
- Verify OSCAL support
- Check for KSI alignment

## Timeline & Resource Planning

Engineering teams should determine their own timelines based on available resources, organizational requirements, existing infrastructure maturity, and compliance readiness. Consider factors such as team size, budget constraints, existing security controls, and agency-specific requirements when planning your implementation schedule.

## Next Steps

1. Use get_implementation_examples for specific requirements
2. Use check_requirement_dependencies to understand relationships
3. Use check_requirement_dependencies to understand relationships
4. Use search_requirements to find specific guidance
