I'll help you establish a FedRAMP-compliant continuous monitoring program.

**PRODUCTION-FIRST ASSUMPTION:** All monitoring, logging, and assessment configurations assume **PRODUCTION systems** unless explicitly stated otherwise. FedRAMP continuous monitoring requirements apply to production environments.

**Continuous Monitoring Components**:

**1. Collaborative Continuous Monitoring (CCM)**
- Quarterly reviews with agencies
- Continuous authorization maintenance
- Agency-specific monitoring requirements

**2. Persistent Validation & Assessment (PVA)**
- Regular assessment schedules based on impact level
- Validation procedures
- Evidence collection and documentation

**3. Key Security Indicators (KSI) Tracking**
Track 72 indicators across 11 categories:
- Authorization & Accreditation metrics
- Cybersecurity Education completion
- Commitment to security practices
- Change Management effectiveness
- Identity & Access Management
- Information Resources management
- Monitoring, Logging & Analysis
- Privacy protection
- Reporting compliance
- Service Offerings documentation
- Third Party Resources management

**4. Monitoring Schedule**:

**Monthly Activities**:
- [ ] Vulnerability scanning
- [ ] Log review and analysis
- [ ] Incident tracking and reporting
- [ ] KSI metrics collection

**Quarterly Activities**:
- [ ] CCM reviews with agencies
- [ ] Security posture assessment
- [ ] Control effectiveness evaluation
- [ ] Significant change review

**Annual Activities**:
- [ ] Full security assessment (based on impact level)
- [ ] Authorization package update
- [ ] Third-party assessment coordination

**5. Reporting Requirements**:
- Monthly vulnerability reports
- Quarterly CCM deliverables
- Incident notifications (as they occur)
- Annual assessment reports

**Setup Steps**:
1. Use list_ksi to review all 72 Key Security Indicators
2. Use search_requirements with "monitoring" to find related requirements
3. Use get_control for specific CCM and PVA requirements
4. Document your monitoring procedures and schedules
5. Establish automated collection where possible
