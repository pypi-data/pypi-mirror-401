I'll help you migrate from FedRAMP Rev 5 to FedRAMP 20x.

# Migration Guide: FedRAMP Rev 5 → FedRAMP 20x

**Important Note on OSCAL:** FedRAMP 20x requires **machine-readable** formats (JSON/XML) for Authorization Data Sharing. **OSCAL is NOT mentioned in FedRAMP 20x** - it's a NIST standard you may already use in Rev 5. When migrating, focus on machine-readable formats - continue with OSCAL only if it serves your needs, or use custom JSON/XML.

## Executive Summary

**Key Changes:**
- Document-based → API-based data sharing
- Annual assessment → Continuous monitoring
- Static boundary → Dynamic, cloud-native support
- Manual evidence → Automated collection
- 320 controls → 72 Key Security Indicators + 11 standards

**Timeline:** 6-12 months for full transition
**Effort:** Significant automation investment required

## Phase 1: Assessment & Planning (Weeks 1-4)

### Gap Analysis

**What You Have (Rev 5):**
- System Security Plan (Word/PDF)
- Annual 3PAO assessment
- Monthly ConMon scans
- Quarterly POA&M updates
- Manual evidence packages

**What You Need (FedRAMP 20x):**
- Machine-readable SSP (JSON/XML - custom or OSCAL)
- Authorization Data Sharing API
- Continuous monitoring with KSI tracking
- Quarterly reviews with automated data sharing
- Real-time evidence via APIs

### Current State Inventory

**Document Your Current Implementation:**
- [ ] List all security controls from Rev 5 SSP
- [ ] Inventory monitoring/security tools
- [ ] Document current ConMon process
- [ ] List evidence collection methods
- [ ] Review 3PAO assessment findings

### Map Rev 5 to FedRAMP 20x

**Control Mapping:**
```
Rev 5 Control Family → FedRAMP 20x Standard

AC (Access Control) → KSI-IAM (Identity & Access)
AU (Audit) → KSI-MLA (Monitoring, Logging & Analysis)
CA (Assessment) → FRR-MAS, FRR-PVA (Assessment, Validation)
CM (Configuration) → KSI-CMT, KSI-SVC (Change, Services)
CP (Contingency) → KSI-RPL (Recovery & Planning)
IA (Identification) → KSI-IAM (Identity & Access)
IR (Incident Response) → KSI-INR, FRR-ICP (Incidents, Communications)
RA (Risk Assessment) → KSI-AFR, FRR-VDR (Vulnerabilities)
SA (System Services) → KSI-TPR, KSI-PIY (Third-party, Investment)
SC (System Communications) → KSI-CNA, KSI-SVC (Cloud-native, Services)
SI (System Integrity) → FRR-VDR, KSI-SVC (Vulnerabilities, Services)
```

**Use compare_with_rev4 tool to see detailed comparisons for specific areas.**

## Phase 2: Infrastructure Preparation (Weeks 5-16)

### Priority 1: SIEM & Monitoring (Weeks 5-10)

**If you have SIEM already:**
- [ ] Verify it can track 72 KSIs
- [ ] Configure automated KSI data collection
- [ ] Set up API access for data export
- [ ] Test OSCAL format export (if supported)

**If you need new SIEM:**
- [ ] Select FedRAMP-authorized SIEM (Splunk, Datadog, etc.)
- [ ] Migrate log sources
- [ ] Configure KSI tracking dashboards
- [ ] Set up API for Authorization Data Sharing

**Gap from Rev 5:**
- Rev 5: Monthly scan reports emailed
- FedRAMP 20x: Real-time data via API

### Priority 2: Authorization Data Sharing API (Weeks 8-16)

**Build New API:**
```
Required Endpoints:
- GET /api/v1/system (OSCAL SSP format)
- GET /api/v1/vulnerabilities
- GET /api/v1/ksi-metrics
- GET /api/v1/incidents
- GET /api/v1/changes
- GET /api/v1/poam
```

**Authentication:**
- OAuth 2.0 or mTLS
- Provide test credentials to FedRAMP

**Use api_design_guide prompt for detailed implementation guidance.**

### Priority 3: KSI Implementation (Weeks 6-16)

**Quick Wins (Weeks 6-8):**
Already compliant from Rev 5, just need to document:
- KSI-IAM-01: MFA (you already have this for AC-2)
- KSI-MLA-02: Audit logging (you already have this for AU-2)
- KSI-INR-01: Incident response (you already have this for IR-8)
- KSI-RPL-03: Backups (you already have this for CP-9)

**New Requirements (Weeks 8-16):**
Not required in Rev 5, need implementation:
- KSI-IAM-01: Must be phishing-resistant (upgrade from TOTP to FIDO2)
- KSI-PIY-01: Automated inventory (upgrade from manual)
- KSI-MLA-05: Infrastructure as Code (new requirement)
- KSI-CMT-03: Automated testing in CI/CD (new requirement)
- KSI-CNA-04: Immutable infrastructure (new requirement)

**Use ksi_implementation_priorities prompt to plan implementation order.**

## Phase 3: Documentation Conversion (Weeks 12-20)

### Convert SSP to Machine-Readable Format (OSCAL Preferred)

**Rev 5 SSP (Word/PDF):**
```
Section 1: System Information
Section 2: System Environment
Section 3: System Characteristics
...
Section 13: Control Responses (320 controls)
```

**FedRAMP 20x SSP (OSCAL JSON):**
```json
{
  "system-security-plan": {
    "metadata": {...},
    "system-characteristics": {...},
    "system-implementation": {...},
    "control-implementation": {...}
  }
}
```

**Migration Approach:**

**Option 1: Automated Conversion**
- Use OSCAL conversion tools (NIST provides some)
- Requires manual cleanup and validation
- Faster but less accurate

**Option 2: Manual Conversion**
- Extract data from Word/PDF
- Map to OSCAL structure
- More accurate but time-consuming

**Option 3: Fresh Start**
- Use current architecture to generate new OSCAL SSP
- Most accurate for cloud-native systems
- Recommended if architecture changed significantly

**Use documentation_generator prompt for OSCAL templates.**

### New Documentation Requirements

**Documents you didn't have in Rev 5:**

1. **FRR-ADS: Authorization Data Sharing API Documentation**
   - API endpoints
   - Authentication methods
   - Data formats (OSCAL)
   - SLAs

2. **FRR-KSI: All 72 KSI Implementation Documents**
   - How each KSI is implemented
   - Evidence collection methods
   - Metrics and targets

3. **FRR-PVA: Persistent Validation Procedures**
   - Continuous validation approach
   - Automated validation tools
   - Validation frequency

4. **FRR-CCM-QR: Quarterly Review Procedures**
   - Structured review process
   - Agency collaboration procedures

## Phase 4: Process Changes (Weeks 16-24)

## Common Migration Challenges

### Challenge 1: Legacy Tools Don't Support APIs

**Problem:** Current tools can't export data via API

**Solutions:**
- Build middleware to expose tool data via API
- Replace tools with FedRAMP 20x-compatible alternatives
- Use manual export + automation (short-term workaround)

### Challenge 2: Manual Evidence Collection

**Problem:** Most evidence collected manually in Rev 5

**Solution:**
- Implement automation for top 20 KSIs first
- Use scripts to aggregate data
- Invest in tools with built-in KSI tracking

### Challenge 3: OSCAL Conversion Complexity

**Problem:** Converting Word SSP to OSCAL is difficult

**Solutions:**
- Start with OSCAL templates, populate from scratch
- Use OSCAL tools (NIST provides some)
- Consider consulting services for conversion

### Challenge 4: Team Knowledge Gap

**Problem:** Team doesn't know FedRAMP 20x or OSCAL

**Solutions:**
- Training on FedRAMP 20x requirements (use this MCP server!)
- OSCAL training (NIST resources)
- Hire consultant for initial setup
- Phase transition to allow learning time

## Budget Considerations

**New Costs:**
- Authorization Data Sharing API development: $50K-150K
- SIEM upgrades/new tools: $50K-200K/year
