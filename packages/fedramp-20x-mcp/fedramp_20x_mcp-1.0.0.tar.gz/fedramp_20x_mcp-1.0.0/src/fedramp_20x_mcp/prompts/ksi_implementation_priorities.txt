## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Foundation
Focus on Priority 1-2 KSIs
- SIEM (KSI-MLA-01) ← Start immediately
- MFA (KSI-IAM-01) ← Parallel track
- Vulnerability scanning (KSI-AFR-04)
- Basic logging (KSI-MLA-02)

### Phase 2: Core Security
Priority 3-4 KSIs
- IaC (KSI-MLA-05)
- Secret management (KSI-SVC-06)
- Network controls (KSI-CNA-01, CNA-03)
- Automated testing (KSI-CMT-03)

### Phase 3: Operations
Priority 5-6 KSIs
- Incident response (KSI-INR-01, INR-02, INR-03)
- Backup/recovery (KSI-RPL-01 through RPL-04)
- Change tracking (KSI-CMT-01)

### Phase 4: Maturity
Priority 7-8 KSIs
- Training programs (KSI-CED)
- Supply chain management (KSI-PIY-07, TPR-04)
- Advanced IAM (KSI-IAM-02, IAM-04)

## Dependencies to Watch

**Blockers:**
- No SIEM = Can't implement 15+ other KSIs
- No IaC = Can't implement immutable infrastructure
- No CI/CD = Can't implement automated testing

**Common Mistakes:**
❌ Starting with advanced KSIs before foundation
❌ Trying to implement all 72 simultaneously
❌ Ignoring dependencies between KSIs
❌ Underestimating SIEM implementation complexity

**Success Patterns:**
✓ Start with SIEM and MFA in parallel
✓ Build automation early (IaC, CI/CD)
✓ Focus on one category at a time
✓ Collect evidence as you go

## Resource Allocation

**Minimum Team:**
- 1 Security Engineer (SIEM, vulnerability management)
- 1 DevOps/SRE (automation, IaC)
- 1 IAM Specialist (MFA, access controls)
- 1 Compliance PM (coordination, documentation)

**Expanded Team:**
Add 2-3 more engineers for parallel workstreams during peak implementation phases
