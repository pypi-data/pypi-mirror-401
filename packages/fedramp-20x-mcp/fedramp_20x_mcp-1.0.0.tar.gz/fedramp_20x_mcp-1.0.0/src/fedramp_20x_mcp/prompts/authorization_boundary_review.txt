I'll help you review your FedRAMP authorization boundary for completeness.

**Minimum Assessment Scope (MAS) Boundary Review**:

**1. Information Resources Inventory**

Must include ALL information resources that are **likely to handle federal customer data** or **likely to impact information handling**:

**Machine-Based Information Resources**:
- [ ] Application servers
- [ ] Database servers
- [ ] Web servers
- [ ] Load balancers
- [ ] Storage systems
- [ ] Network devices
- [ ] Security appliances
- [ ] Monitoring systems
- [ ] Backup systems
- [ ] Development/staging environments (if they handle customer data)

**Non-Machine-Based Information Resources**:
- [ ] Organizational policies
- [ ] Security procedures
- [ ] Employees with system access
- [ ] Training programs
- [ ] Incident response processes
- [ ] Change management procedures

**2. Third-Party Information Resources**

Document ALL third-party services:
- [ ] Cloud infrastructure providers
- [ ] SaaS tools and services
- [ ] Development tools
- [ ] Monitoring/logging services
- [ ] Identity providers
- [ ] Payment processors
- [ ] CDN providers

**3. Federal Customer Data Flow**

Trace data flow through your system:
- Where does federal customer data enter?
- What systems process or store it?
- How is it transmitted?
- Where is it backed up?
- How is it deleted/archived?

**4. Boundary Exclusions**

FedRAMP explicitly excludes certain categories (per OMB direction):
- Identify any excluded services
- Document why they're out of scope
- Verify exclusions are valid

**5. Assessment Scope Validation**

For each component, verify:
- [ ] Is it documented in the system inventory?
- [ ] Is its function clearly described?
- [ ] Are security controls identified?
- [ ] Is it included in the assessment scope?
- [ ] Are interconnections documented?

**Common Boundary Gaps**:
❌ Missing development/staging environments that process customer data
❌ Undocumented third-party services
❌ Forgotten monitoring or logging systems
❌ Backup systems not included
❌ Non-machine resources (policies, procedures, people) omitted

**Next Steps**:
1. Use search_requirements with "minimum assessment scope" or "information resource"
2. Use list_family_controls with "MAS" for detailed requirements
3. Review get_definition for "Information Resource" and "Cloud Service Offering"
4. Document any boundary additions or clarifications needed
