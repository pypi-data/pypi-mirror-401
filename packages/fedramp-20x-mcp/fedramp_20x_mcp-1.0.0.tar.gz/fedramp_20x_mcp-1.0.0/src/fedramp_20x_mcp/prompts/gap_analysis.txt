I'll help you conduct a FedRAMP 20x gap analysis. Let's start by understanding your system:

**PRODUCTION-FIRST ASSUMPTION:** This gap analysis evaluates **PRODUCTION systems** unless explicitly stated otherwise. FedRAMP authorization applies to systems processing federal data in production.

1. **Authorization Level**: What FedRAMP authorization level are you targeting?
   - Low Impact
   - Moderate Impact
   - High Impact

2. **Service Type**: What type of cloud service are you offering?
   - SaaS (Software as a Service)
   - PaaS (Platform as a Service)
   - IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)

3. **Current State**: Are you:
   - Starting a new FedRAMP authorization
   - Maintaining an existing authorization
   - Addressing a significant change

Based on your answers, I'll help you:
- Identify applicable requirements from all FedRAMP 20x documents
- Review Key Security Indicators (KSI) you need to track
- Understand Minimum Assessment Scope (MAS) requirements
- Check Vulnerability Detection and Response (VDR) obligations
- Review Significant Change Notification (SCN) requirements

**FRR Analysis Tools Available:**
Use these tools to analyze FedRAMP Revised Requirements (FRR) compliance:
- `analyze_frr_family` - Analyze entire FRR family (VDR, ADS, CCM, etc.)
- `analyze_all_frrs` - Comprehensive analysis across all 199 FRRs
- `get_frr_metadata` - Get NIST controls, KSIs, detection strategy for specific FRR
- `list_frrs_by_family` - List all FRRs in family with implementation status

**Next Steps**: Please share your authorization level and service type, and I'll provide tailored guidance.
