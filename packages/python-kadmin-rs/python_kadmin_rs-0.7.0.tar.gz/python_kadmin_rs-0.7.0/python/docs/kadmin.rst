.. py:module:: kadmin

.. py:class:: KAdm5Variant

   kadm5 library variant

   Represent a kadm5 library to use. This struct will determine which C library kadmin will link
   against. The list of currently supported options consist of the enum variants.

   Depending on how kadmin was compiled, not all variants may be supported on your system. Refer
   to the package documentation on how to compile for all possible options.

   .. py:attribute:: MitClient

      MIT krb5 client-side library

      :type: KAdm5Variant

   .. py:attribute:: MitServer

      :type: KAdm5Variant

.. py:class:: KAdminApiVersion

   kadm5 API version

   MIT krb5 supports up to version 4. Heimdal supports up to version 2.

   This changes which fields will be available in the Policy and Principal structs. If the version
   is too low, some fields may not be populated. We try our best to document those in the fields
   documentation themselves.

   If no version is provided during the KAdmin initialization, it defaults to the most conservative
   one, currently version 2.
