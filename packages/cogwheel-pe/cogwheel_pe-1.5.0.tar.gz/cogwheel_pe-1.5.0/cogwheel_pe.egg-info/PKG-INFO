# `cogwheel`

`cogwheel` is a code for parameter estimation of gravitational wave sources.
It implements a convenient system of coordinates for sampling, a "folding" algorithm to reduce the multimodality of posteriors, and the relative binning algorithm for fast likelihood evaluation (generalized to waveforms with higher modes).
It supports likelihood marginalization over distance, as well as over all extrinsic parameters describing a merger.
It interfaces with third-party routines for downloading public data (GWOSC, `GWpy`), generating waveforms (`lalsuite`) and sampling distributions (`PyMultiNest`, `dynesty`, `zeus`, `nautilus`).

## Installation
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge cogwheel-pe
```

## Crash course

Example: how to sample a gravitational wave source posterior using `Nautilus`:
```python
from cogwheel import data
from cogwheel import sampling
from cogwheel.posterior import Posterior

parentdir = 'example'  # Directory that will contain parameter estimation runs

eventname, mchirp_guess = 'GW150914', 30
approximant = 'IMRPhenomXPHM'
prior_class = 'CartesianIntrinsicIASPrior'

filenames, detector_names, tgps = data.download_timeseries(eventname)
event_data = data.EventData.from_timeseries(
    filenames, eventname, detector_names, tgps)

post = Posterior.from_event(event_data, mchirp_guess, approximant, prior_class)

sampler = sampling.Nautilus(post, run_kwargs=dict(n_live=1000))

rundir = sampler.get_rundir(parentdir)
sampler.run(rundir)  # Will take a while
```
Load and plot the samples:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
from cogwheel import gw_plotting

samples = pd.read_feather(rundir/sampling.SAMPLES_FILENAME)
gw_plotting.CornerPlot(samples,
                       params=sampler.sampled_params,
                       tail_probability=1e-4).plot()
plt.savefig(rundir/f'{eventname}.pdf', bbox_inches='tight')
```
