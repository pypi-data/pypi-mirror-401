    Converts a more convenient sweep definition list to a strict list of tuples of sweeps.
    The sweep instances themselves are the same, except single sweep instances are turned
    into a tuple containing a single sweep.

    Verify that:
    * sweeps list element is either Sweep or ParallelSweep
    * tuple_of_sweep element is a Sweep
    * tuple of sweeps contains at least one element
    * length of a data is identical in all tuples of sweeps

    Returns:
        List of tuples of sweeps.
