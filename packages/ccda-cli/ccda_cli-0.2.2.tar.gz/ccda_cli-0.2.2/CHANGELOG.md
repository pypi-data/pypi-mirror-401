## [0.1.9] - 2026-01-12

### Changed

- Version bump to publish GitHub PURL support to PyPI
- No code changes from 0.1.8 (which included the GitHub PURL feature but was not published with it)

### Changed

- GitHub packages now skip package registry discovery (not needed for pkg:github/*)

  - Automatically enriches contributor data with company information from GitHub user profiles
  - Extracts GitHub usernames from commit emails (e.g., `username@users.noreply.github.com`)
  - Fetches user profiles from GitHub API in batch to minimize API calls
  - Caches user profiles for 30 days to avoid duplicate requests
  - Normalizes company names using configurable mappings (e.g., "@google" → "Google")
  - Respects GitHub API rate limits and degrades gracefully
  - Falls back to email domain detection when API unavailable or rate limited
  - Provides more accurate elephant factor and company distribution metrics
- New `CompanyEnricher` class in `ccda_cli.enrichment.company` module
- Configuration option `github.enrich_company_affiliation` (default: true when token provided)
- Comprehensive test suite for company enrichment (16 unit tests)
- Enhanced documentation in `docs/github-token-setup.md` with company enrichment examples

### Changed

- `GitMetricsAnalyzer` now accepts optional `github_token` parameter for enrichment

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-05

### Added

- **osslili as required dependency** for professional license detection
  - Replaced brittle pattern-matching with osslili's Python API
  - Accurate SPDX license identification with confidence scores
  - Copyright statement extraction
  - Support for all osslili detection methods (metadata, file analysis, keyword matching)

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Cargo package tarball scanning now works correctly
  - Fixed `.crate` file download from crates.io (was downloading as `download` with no extension)
  - Added `.crate` extension support to archive extraction
  - Enhanced download URL detection to handle redirects properly (checks Content-Disposition header and final redirect URL)
- License file detection now works for all ecosystems
  - Removed incomplete `LICENSE_PATTERNS` that missed common patterns like `LICENSE-MIT`, `LICENSE-APACHE`
  - Now uses osslili for comprehensive license file discovery
- Relative path display in scan results (shows `serde-1.0.228/LICENSE-MIT` instead of full temp paths)

### Changed

- **Breaking**: osslili is now a required dependency (previously optional)
- **Breaking**: purl2src is now a required dependency (previously optional)
- Removed optional dependency groups `scanner` and `all`
- Tarball scanner completely refactored to use osslili Python API
  - Deleted 200+ lines of brittle pattern-matching code

  - Integrated purl2src library as optional dependency
  - Tarball scanner now auto-discovers download URLs from PURLs

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-04

### Added

- Dynamic API sampling based on GitHub token authentication status
  - Authenticated (5000 calls/hr): Fetches up to 5000 issues, 5000 PRs, 2000 closed issues
  - Unauthenticated (60 calls/hr): Conservative limits of 300 items per category
- Sampling metadata in JSON output for transparency
  - `_sampling` field in `IssueMetrics` showing sample size vs total count
  - `_sampling` field in `PullRequestMetrics` with coverage information

  - Issue sample size increased from 300 to 5000 when authenticated (16x improvement)
  - PR sample size increased from 300 to 5000 when authenticated (16x improvement)
  - Unlabeled rate now calculated from proper sample size
  - Unresponded rate now reflects larger sample for better accuracy
- Burnout score `issue_backlog` now uses adjusted full count instead of sampled count
- PR counts (open/merged/closed) now reflect comprehensive data instead of first 300 items

### Changed

- `IssueMetrics` dataclass now includes `sampled_open_count` and `sampled_closed_count` fields
- `PullRequestMetrics` dataclass now includes `sampled_count` field
- GitHub API collector now adapts page limits based on token availability

- Helper methods `_classify_frequency()` and `_classify_velocity()` for categorizing activity levels

### Fixed

- Dashboard template compatibility by exposing CHAOSS and extended metrics in health score output (#1)
