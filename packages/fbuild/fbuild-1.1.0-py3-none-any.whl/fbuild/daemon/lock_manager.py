"""
Resource Lock Manager - Unified lock management for daemon operations.

This module provides the ResourceLockManager class which centralizes all
lock management logic that was previously scattered across daemon.py.
It provides context managers for automatic lock acquisition/release and
includes cleanup for unused locks to prevent memory leaks.
