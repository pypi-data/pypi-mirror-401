ASE (Adult Sepsis Event) Production Implementation
CDC Sepsis Surveillance Calculator - Standalone Version

This script implements the CDC Adult Sepsis Event (ASE) surveillance definition
as specified in the March 2018 CDC Sepsis Surveillance Toolkit.
CDC ASE Definition:
**Sepsis = Component A (Presumed Serious Infection) + Component B (Acute Organ Dysfunction)**

- **Component A**: Blood culture + ≥4 Qualifying Antimicrobial Days (QAD)
- **Component B**: ≥1 organ dysfunction criterion within ±2 calendar days of blood culture

Component A: Presumed Serious Infection

### CDC Definition (Pages 5-8):
1. Blood culture obtained (result not required)
2. ≥4 Qualifying Antimicrobial Days (QAD) starting within ±2 calendar days of blood culture
   - New antimicrobial (not given in prior 2 days)
   - At least one IV/IM antimicrobial required
   - 1-day gaps allowed between antimicrobial days

For Identifying QAD, CDC Requirements:
- "New antimicrobial" = not given in prior 2 calendar days
- First antimicrobial must be IV/IM and within ±2 calendar days of blood culture
- Need ≥4 consecutive days (allowing 1-day gaps)
- CDC allows QAD < 4 days if patient dies, transfers to acute care, or goes to hospice (Page 8)

Component B: Acute Organ Dysfunction

### CDC Definition (Page 5 and 9):
At least ONE organ dysfunction criterion within ±2 calendar days of blood culture:
1. **Renal**: Creatinine ≥2x baseline (exclude ESRD)
2. **Hepatic**: Bilirubin ≥2.0 mg/dL AND ≥2x baseline
3. **Coagulation**: Platelets <100 cells/μL AND ≥50% decline from baseline ≥100
4. **Metabolic**: Lactate ≥2.0 mmol/L
5. **Cardiovascular**: New vasopressor initiation
6. **Respiratory**: New mechanical ventilation initiation

POST-Processing Apply RIT (Repeat Infection Timeframe) Post-Processing

CDC Page 9: For hospital-onset events, apply 14-day repeat infection timeframe to avoid duplicate counting

Memory-optimized implementation with staged data loading and immediate cleanup.
