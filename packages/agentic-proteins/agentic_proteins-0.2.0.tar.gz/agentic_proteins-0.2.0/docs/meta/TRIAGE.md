Why: This doc exists to record its single responsibility for review.  

## Overview  
This doc defines one responsibility.  
Architecture components are defined in [architecture/architecture.md](../architecture/architecture.md).  
Read [DOCS_STYLE.md](DOCS_STYLE.md) before edits.  
Read [SPINE.md](SPINE.md) for context.  

## Contracts  
Each statement is a contract.  
Contracts align with [tests/unit/test_docs_contract.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/unit/test_docs_contract.py).  
Contracts link to [DOCS_STYLE.md](DOCS_STYLE.md) and [SPINE.md](SPINE.md).  

## Invariants  
Invariants describe stable behavior.  
Checks align with [tests/unit/test_docs_contract.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/unit/test_docs_contract.py).  
Invariants align with [DOCS_STYLE.md](DOCS_STYLE.md).  

## Failure Modes  
Failures are explicit and tested.  
Failure coverage aligns with [tests/unit/test_docs_contract.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/unit/test_docs_contract.py).  
Failures align with [SPINE.md](SPINE.md).  

## Extension Points  
Extensions require tests and docs.  
Extensions are tracked in [DOCS_STYLE.md](DOCS_STYLE.md).  
Extensions align with [tests/unit/test_docs_contract.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/unit/test_docs_contract.py).  

## Exit Criteria  
This doc becomes obsolete when the surface ends.  
The replacement is linked in [SPINE.md](SPINE.md).  
Obsolete docs are removed.
