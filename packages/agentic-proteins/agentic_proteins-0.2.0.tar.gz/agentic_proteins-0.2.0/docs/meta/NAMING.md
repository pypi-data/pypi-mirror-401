# NAMING  

**Scope:** Canonical naming registry.  
**Audience:** Contributors and reviewers.  
**Guarantees:** Names and casing are enforced.  
**Non-Goals:** Domain theory.  
Why: This doc exists to record its single responsibility for review.  

## Overview  
This doc defines canonical names.  
Architecture components are defined in [architecture/architecture.md](../architecture/architecture.md).  
Read [DOCS_STYLE.md](DOCS_STYLE.md) before edits.  
Read [DOCS_VOICE.md](DOCS_VOICE.md) for voice rules.  

## Contracts  
Canonical names are listed below.  
Forbidden aliases are listed below.  
Capitalization follows the canonical list.  

## Invariants  
Each concept has one canonical name.  
Aliases are rejected in docs.  
Casing is enforced by CI.  

## Failure Modes  
Alias usage fails docs lint.  
Casing drift fails docs lint.  
Undefined names fail reviews.  

## Extension Points  
Naming changes occur in this file.  
Naming changes update [scripts/check_docs_consistency.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/scripts/check_docs_consistency.py).  
Naming changes update [TRIAGE.md](TRIAGE.md).  

## Exit Criteria  
This doc becomes obsolete when naming is generated.  
The replacement is [scripts/check_docs_consistency.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/scripts/check_docs_consistency.py).  
Obsolete docs are removed.
