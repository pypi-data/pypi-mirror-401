# DOCS_VOICE  

**Scope:** Documentation voice rules.  
**Audience:** Contributors writing docs.  
**Guarantees:** Voice rules are enforced by CI.  
**Non-Goals:** Copywriting advice.  
Why: This doc exists to record its single responsibility for review.  

## Overview  
This doc defines the documentation voice.  
Architecture components are defined in [architecture/architecture.md](../architecture/architecture.md).  
Read [DOCS_STYLE.md](DOCS_STYLE.md) before edits.  
Read [NAMING.md](NAMING.md) for naming context.  

## Contracts  
Tense is present and declarative.  
Person is impersonal and system-centric.  
Sentence length is limited to twenty words.  

## Invariants  
Marketing language is forbidden.  
Opinion and hedging language is forbidden.  
Narrative framing is forbidden.  

## Failure Modes  
Voice violations fail docs lint.  
Voice violations block CI.  
Voice violations require a rewrite.  

## Extension Points

Voice changes update [scripts/check_docs_consistency.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/scripts/check_docs_consistency.py).  
Voice changes update [DOCS_STYLE.md](DOCS_STYLE.md).
