# threat_model  

**Scope:** Threat model skeleton.  
**Audience:** Contributors.  
**Guarantees:** Captures abuse cases, resource risks, and assumptions.  
**Non-Goals:** Mitigations.  
Why: This doc exists to record its single responsibility for review.  

## Overview  
This doc defines one responsibility.  
Architecture components are defined in [../architecture/architecture.md](../architecture/architecture.md).  
Read [dependencies.md](dependencies.md) before edits.  
Read [../../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md) for context.  

## Contracts  
Each statement is a contract.  
Contracts align with [tests/unit/test_abuse_case_path_traversal.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/unit/test_abuse_case_path_traversal.py).  
Contracts link to [dependencies.md](dependencies.md) and [../../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md).  

## Invariants  
Invariants describe stable behavior.  
Checks align with [tests/unit/test_abuse_case_path_traversal.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/unit/test_abuse_case_path_traversal.py).  
Invariants align with [dependencies.md](dependencies.md).  

## Failure Modes  
Failures are explicit and tested.  
Failure coverage aligns with [tests/unit/test_abuse_case_path_traversal.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/unit/test_abuse_case_path_traversal.py).  
Failures align with [../../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md).  

## Extension Points  
Extensions require tests and docs.  
Extensions are tracked in [dependencies.md](dependencies.md).  
Extensions align with [tests/unit/test_abuse_case_path_traversal.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/unit/test_abuse_case_path_traversal.py).  

## Exit Criteria  
This doc becomes obsolete when the surface ends.  
The replacement is linked in [../../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md).  
Obsolete docs are removed.  

Code refs: [tests/unit/test_abuse_case_path_traversal.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/unit/test_abuse_case_path_traversal.py).  
Threats:  
- Conceptual drift in core definitions.  
- LLM overreach beyond regulator bounds.  
- Performance regression under load.  
- Reviewer misinterpretation of claims.  
Abuse cases:  
- Path traversal via candidate IDs.  
- Crafted sequence inputs to bypass validation.  
- Unauthorized resume requests for stale runs.  
Resource risks:  
- Large batch runs exhaust disk.  
- Oversized sequences exhaust memory.  
- High-rate API requests saturate CPU.  
Assumptions:  
- Local filesystem permissions prevent cross-tenant access.  
- Providers return deterministic results for fixed inputs.  
- CI artifacts are not tampered with between steps.
