# neutral_results  

**Scope:** Negative and neutral results.  
**Audience:** Reviewers and contributors.  
**Guarantees:** Limits are documented.  
**Non-Goals:** Full benchmark report.  
Why: This doc exists to record its single responsibility for review.  

## Overview  
This doc records neutral and negative results.  
Architecture context lives in [architecture/architecture.md](../architecture/architecture.md).  
Claim context lives in [falsifiable_claim.md](falsifiable_claim.md).  

## Contracts  
Regulator proposals can reduce recovery under strict constraints.  
Agenticity adds no benefit in low-noise pathways.  
Deterministic baselines win in short runs.  
Evidence uses [tests/regression/test_negative_results.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/regression/test_negative_results.py).  

## Invariants  
Reported negatives remain visible.  
Results align with [../governance/core.md](../governance/core.md).  
Evidence aligns with [tests/regression/test_negative_results.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/regression/test_negative_results.py).  

## Failure Modes  
Missing negatives reduces credibility.  
Result drift breaks [../governance/core.md](../governance/core.md).  
Missing evidence breaks [../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md).  

## Extension Points  
Result updates follow [../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md](../meta/DOCS_STYLE.md).  
Extensions align with [architecture/experimental.md](../architecture/experimental.md).  
Evidence updates align with [tests/unit/test_docs_contract.py](https://github.com/bijux/agentic-proteins/blob/main/tests/unit/test_docs_contract.py).  

## Exit Criteria  
This doc is obsolete when results are automated.  
The replacement is [architecture/metrics.md](../architecture/metrics.md).  
Obsolete docs are removed.
