# Development and Extension

Extension points:

- Add new agents under agentic_proteins.agents with explicit schemas.
- Add new tools under agentic_proteins.tools with deterministic contracts.
- Add new providers under agentic_proteins.providers with metadata and error mapping.

Docs constraints:

- Documentation references must map to real modules.
- Speculative language is rejected by docs consistency checks.

Module refs: agentic_proteins.agents, agentic_proteins.tools, agentic_proteins.providers.
