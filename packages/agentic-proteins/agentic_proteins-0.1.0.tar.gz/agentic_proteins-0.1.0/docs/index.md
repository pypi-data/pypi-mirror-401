## Why Agentic Proteins?

Protein design workflows need traceable decisions, stable artifacts, and reproducible execution paths. Agentic Proteins provides a deterministic loop that separates planning, execution, evaluation, and human decision points so that labs can audit and reproduce runs without digging into internal code.

## Try It in 30 Seconds

```bash
pipx install agentic-proteins  # Or: pip install agentic-proteins
agentic-proteins run --sequence "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"
agentic-proteins inspect-candidate --latest
```

<a id="quick-start"></a>

## Quick Start

```bash

# Run a deterministic loop

agentic-proteins run --sequence "ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY"

# Resume a run by ID

agentic-proteins resume --run-id <run_id>

# Compare two runs

agentic-proteins compare --left <run_id> --right <run_id>
```

<a id="what-this-does"></a>

## What This Does

* Runs a deterministic agentic loop with traceable artifacts and telemetry.
* Produces proxy structure-quality signals from sequence heuristics by default.
* Requires explicit opt-in to run real structure predictors via `--provider`.

<a id="what-this-does-not-do"></a>

## What This Does Not Do

* It does not run real structure prediction unless `--provider esmfold|rosettafold|openprotein` is specified and requirements are met.
* It does not finalize candidate selection without a signed human decision artifact.
* It does not expose internal modules as stable APIs.

## Stable Public Surface

* Supported CLI commands: `run`, `resume`, `compare`, `inspect-candidate`, `export-report`.
* Stable artifacts: `artifacts/<run_id>/` layout and JSON payloads.
* Stable CLI JSON output schema (see docs).
