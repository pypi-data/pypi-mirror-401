# Real Local Tests

These tests run **real local structure models** (ESMFold, RoseTTAFold) via the CLI.

Purpose:
- Confirm local providers load and execute end-to-end.
- Produce a real PDB artifact and compute metrics from coordinates.
- Validate artifact layout and report payloads.

Requirements:
- Local model weights and dependencies installed.
- GPU is optional but strongly recommended for speed.
- Docker is required for the RoseTTAFold provider when using its docker mode.

How to run:
```
pytest tests/real_local -m real -s
```

Notes:
- These tests are **not run in CI**.
- They are slow and resource-intensive by design.
