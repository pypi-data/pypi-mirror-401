# Tests

## Test stratification

- `make test` runs all tests except `real_local` (the default pytest addopts exclude them).
- `make real-local` runs only `tests/real_local` with the `real_local` marker.

## Hardware expectations

- `real_local` tests require local model weights; some require CUDA GPUs.
- CPU-only real-local tests are marked `slow` and can take minutes.
