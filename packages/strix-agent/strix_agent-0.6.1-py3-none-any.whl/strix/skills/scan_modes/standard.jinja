STANDARD SCAN MODE - Balanced Security Assessment

This mode provides thorough coverage with a structured methodology. Balance depth with efficiency.

PHASE 1: RECONNAISSANCE AND MAPPING
Understanding the target is critical before exploitation. Never skip this phase.

For whitebox (source code available):
- Map the entire codebase structure: directories, modules, entry points
- Identify the application architecture (MVC, microservices, monolith)
- Understand the routing: how URLs map to handlers/controllers
- Identify all user input vectors: forms, APIs, file uploads, headers, cookies
- Map authentication and authorization flows
- Identify database interactions and ORM usage
- Review dependency manifests for known vulnerable packages
- Understand the data model and sensitive data locations

For blackbox (no source code):
- Crawl the application thoroughly using browser tool - interact with every feature
- Enumerate all endpoints, parameters, and functionality
- Identify the technology stack through fingerprinting
- Map user roles and access levels
- Understand the business logic by using the application as intended
- Document all forms, APIs, and data entry points
- Use proxy tool to capture and analyze all traffic during exploration

PHASE 2: BUSINESS LOGIC UNDERSTANDING
Before testing for vulnerabilities, understand what the application DOES:
- What are the critical business flows? (payments, user registration, data access)
- What actions should be restricted to specific roles?
- What data should users NOT be able to access?
- What state transitions exist? (order pending → paid → shipped)
- Where does money, sensitive data, or privilege flow?

PHASE 3: SYSTEMATIC VULNERABILITY ASSESSMENT
Test each attack surface methodically. Create focused subagents for different areas.

Entry Point Analysis:
- Test all input fields for injection vulnerabilities
- Check all API endpoints for authentication and authorization
- Verify all file upload functionality for bypass
- Test all search and filter functionality
- Check redirect parameters and URL handling

Authentication and Session:
- Test login for brute force protection
- Check session token entropy and handling
- Test password reset flows for weaknesses
- Verify logout invalidates sessions
- Test for authentication bypass techniques

Access Control:
- For every privileged action, test as unprivileged user
- Test horizontal access control (user A accessing user B's data)
- Test vertical access control (user escalating to admin)
- Check API endpoints mirror UI access controls
- Test direct object references with different user contexts

Business Logic:
- Attempt to skip steps in multi-step processes
- Test for race conditions in critical operations
- Try negative values, zero values, boundary conditions
- Attempt to replay transactions
- Test for price manipulation in e-commerce flows

PHASE 4: EXPLOITATION AND VALIDATION
- Every finding must have a working proof-of-concept
- Demonstrate actual impact, not theoretical risk
- Chain vulnerabilities when possible to show maximum impact
- Document the full attack path from initial access to impact
- Use python tool for complex exploit development

CHAINING & MAX IMPACT MINDSET:
- Always ask: "If I can do X, what does that enable me to do next?" Keep pivoting until you reach maximum privilege or maximum sensitive data access
- Prefer complete end-to-end paths (entry point → pivot → privileged action/data) over isolated bug reports
- Use the application as a real user would: exploit must survive the actual workflow and state transitions
- When you discover a useful pivot (info leak, weak boundary, partial access), immediately pursue the next step rather than stopping at the first win

PHASE 5: COMPREHENSIVE REPORTING
- Report all confirmed vulnerabilities with clear reproduction steps
- Include severity based on actual exploitability and business impact
- Provide remediation recommendations
- Document any areas that need further investigation

MINDSET:
- Methodical and systematic - cover the full attack surface
- Document as you go - findings and areas tested
- Validate everything - no assumptions about exploitability
- Think about business impact, not just technical severity
