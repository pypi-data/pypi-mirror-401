    "# Aligned learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "_Aligned using the revised version of Blooms taxonomy (Anderson et al. 2001)_\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify practical challenges of planning sea-based research, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Availability and capabilities of research vessels and equipment, e.g. ice breaker vessel needed, infrastructure for equipment available\n",
    "- General logistics, e.g. transportation of container labs and other equipment\n",
    "- Requesting permits\n",
    "  - Travel permits for staff\n",
    "  - Diplomatic clearance (EEZ)\n",
    "  - Customs documents\n",
    "- Safety trainings (beforehand and onboard)\n",
    "- Preparing, testing and transporting equipment\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Be aware of (describe) matters during sea-based research, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Contingency due to weather conditions and other unforeseen circumstances\n",
    "- The need to be flexible and patient\n",
    "- Taking notes, recording coordinates, stations, casts\n",
    "- Measurement protocols\n",
    "- Communication with crew, e.g. captain, winch driver\n",
    "- Living at sea, e.g. sea legs, seasickness, relaxation, water/energy/waste footprint\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Give examples of uncertainty and variability of sea-based observations, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Likely errors or wrong values, and seeing the data through the noise\n",
    "- Time and date coordinates, e.g. UTC, local time, ship time\n",
    "- Variability and limitations of measurements\n",
    "- Different scales of variability, e.g. tidal, seasonal\n",
    "- ‘Synopticity’ of measurements (i.e. not possible to measure with one ship at multiple locations at the same time; therefore mixing time and space variability)\n",
    "- Instrument specific qualities, e.g. ADCP reflection\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Learn how to analyse and interpret sea-based observations. Be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Read in different data formats, e.g. nc, csv, zarr\n",
    "- Manipulate arrays and other data structures in python\n",
    "- Create and interpret density/TS profiles\n",
    "- Create spatial temperature/salinity/velocity maps, do GIS things\n",
    "- Interpret plots and deduce ocean circulation\n",
    "- Report findings\n",
    "- Contribute to a cruise report with pictures or plots\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Plan a research cruise. Be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formulate research questions\n",
    "- Select sampling sites\n",
    "- Consider the duration of deployments, e.g. time a CTD station takes\n",
    "- Decide on on-site measurement order\n",
    "- Plan rest/working shifts for scientific personnel\n",
    "- Deal with contingency, e.g. consider what sites/measurements are essential, which are ok to skip"
