    "## Welcome aboard VirtualShip!\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome aboard, oceanography students, to our scientific research vessel! We're thrilled to have you join us for this exciting 3-week journey into the depths of the ocean. As we embark on this voyage of exploration and discovery, there are a few things we'd like to share with you to ensure a smooth and enriching experience:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction to the Vessel:** Take some time to familiarize yourselves with the layout of the ship. Get to know key areas such as the laboratories, living quarters, dining area, and deck spaces. E.g. at https://viewer.foleon.com/preview/vo2PZClgA/rv-wim-wolff\n",
    "\n",
    "**Daily Routine:** Life on a research vessel follows a structured daily routine. We'll have designated times for meals, research activities, data analysis, and downtime. It's important to maintain this routine to ensure that our work is conducted efficiently and that everyone onboard has the opportunity to rest and recharge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety Orientation:** Safety is our top priority. As we set sail, we'll conduct a comprehensive safety orientation. This will cover important topics such as emergency procedures, the location of safety equipment, and proper use of personal protective gear. Please pay close attention during this orientation to ensure your safety and the safety of others on board.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Respect for the Environment:** As we explore the ocean, it's essential to maintain a deep respect for the marine environment. We'll adhere to strict environmental protocols to minimize our impact on marine ecosystems and wildlife. Remember to dispose of waste properly and avoid disturbing marine life whenever possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Teamwork and Collaboration:** Oceanographic research is a collaborative effort that requires teamwork and cooperation. You'll be working closely with your fellow students. Embrace the opportunity to learn from each other and support one another throughout the journey."

    "## Emergency procedures\n",
    "\n",
    "Before going on any research expedition you need follow a one day Safety at Sea course and get a medical check-up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course this is not needed for your virtual fieldwork, but we would like to draw for your attention to the following on-board emergency procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Safety Drills:** We conduct regular safety drills to ensure that everyone on board is well-prepared in case of an emergency. Specifically, fire and boat drills are held once a week. These drills are not just routine; they are essential survival training and should be taken seriously. To minimize disruption to the research program, science party members are usually notified in advance of the scheduled drills. In the event that you must continue working during a drill, prior arrangements can be made through the Chief Scientist.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Emergency Signal:** In the event of an emergency signal, your immediate action is crucial. Don life jackets, put on long-sleeved garments, and wear a hat or head covering if available. Then, proceed to the designated station indicated on the station card located next to your bunk.\n",
    "\n",
    "**On-Call Readiness:** Please keep in mind that while on board the ship, you may be called upon without warning to assist during your off-watch periods. Emergencies can happen at any time, and your readiness to respond promptly and efficiently is essential to the safety of all aboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Boat Drill (Abandon Ship):** The signal for abandon ship is seven or more short blasts followed by one long blast of the ship’s whistle and general alarm. When this signal is heard, report to your designated life raft station. There the Mate in charge will explain the procedures for launching and embarking into the life rafts. The rafts will not be launched during a drill.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fire and Emergency Drills:** The signal is one long blast on the ship’s whistle and general alarm bell, lasting for ten seconds or more. During this drill, members of the science party muster in the designated area. Attendance will be taken and reported to the bridge.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Man Overboard:** If someone falls overboard, throw a life-ring into the water towards the person. Keep your eye on the person at all times and point towards the person. Shout “MAN OVERBOARD, STARBOARD (or PORT),” and call the bridge on the sound powered phone or squawk box to inform them without losing sight of the person if possible. If you hear someone hail \"Man Overboard,\" pass the word to the bridge."

Documentation on how to use the website can be found [here](https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/84TFmsAAzcSD56F). Alternatively, you can watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yIpYX2xCvsM&list=PLE-LzO7kk1gLM74U4PLDh8RywYXmZcloz&ab_channel=VirtualShipClassroom), which runs through how to use the MFP tool.\n",

These underway measurements can be switched on/off under _Ship Config Editor_ > _Ship Speed & Onboard Measurements_ as well.\n",

    "\n",
    "Each waypoint has its own sub-panel for parameter inputs (click on it to expand the selection options). Here, the time for each waypoint can be inputted. There is also an option to adjust the latitude/longitude coordinates and you can add or remove waypoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> \n",

    "\n",
    "### Instrument selection\n",

    "**CAUTION**: The `virtualship plan` tool will check that the ship can reach each waypoint according to the prescribed ship speed (10 knots). However, before the ultimate simulation step (i.e. step 6 below) there will be a final, automated check that the schedule also accounts for the time taken to conduct the measurements at each site (e.g. a CTD cast in deeper waters will take longer). Therefore, we recommend to take this extra time into account at this stage of the planning by estimating how long each measurement will take and adding this time on.\n",

In the terminal, running `cp -r /data/storage-osl/tutorials/* /data/storage-osl/{your-group-name}/` would copy __all__ the tutorial notebooks to your group's directory, so if you only want to copy specific ones, make sure to adjust the command accordingly."
