# 3D Camera Control Library

This Python library provides automated control functionalities for 3D camera setups, enabling developers to programmatically manage camera positions and orientations. It is designed to integrate seamlessly with advanced 3D camera control techniques.

## Installation

To install the 3D Camera Control library, use pip:
bash
pip install 3d-camera-control

## Basic Usage Examples

Here are a few examples demonstrating how to use the library:

**1. Rotating the Camera Around a Fixed Point:**

This example demonstrates rotating the camera around a central point (e.g., the origin). This is useful for creating 360-degree views of an object.
python
from camera_control import CameraController

# Initialize the camera controller
camera = CameraController()

# Set the point of interest
point_of_interest = (0, 0, 0)

# Rotate the camera 360 degrees in 10 steps
for angle in range(0, 360, 36):
    camera.rotate_around_point(point_of_interest, angle)
    camera.capture_image(f"rotation_{angle}.png") # Assuming capture_image is implemented

**2. Creating a Zoom-In Effect:**

This example shows how to programmatically zoom the camera in towards a specific target.
python
from camera_control import CameraController

# Initialize the camera controller
camera = CameraController()

# Set the target point
target_point = (1, 2, 3)

# Zoom in towards the target in 5 steps
for i in range(5):
    camera.zoom_to_target(target_point, step_size=0.2) # Assuming zoom_to_target is implemented
    camera.capture_image(f"zoom_{i}.png")

**3. Simulating a Camera Dolly Shot:**

This example demonstrates how to move the camera along a predefined path while keeping the focus on a specific object.
python
from camera_control import CameraController

# Initialize the camera controller
camera = CameraController()

# Define the path (example: a straight line)
path = [(0, 0, 5), (2, 0, 5), (4, 0, 5)]

# Set the target object
target_object = (2, 0, 0)

# Move the camera along the path
for position in path:
    camera.move_to(position) # Assuming move_to is implemented
    camera.look_at(target_object) # Assuming look_at is implemented
    camera.capture_image(f"dolly_{position}.png")

**4. Generating Multiple Views from Different Elevations:**

This example demonstrates how to capture images from different elevations while maintaining a fixed distance to the subject.
python
from camera_control import CameraController

# Initialize the camera controller
camera = CameraController()

# Subject position
subject_position = (0, 0, 0)

# Capture images from different elevations
elevations = [30, 45, 60, 75] # in degrees

for elevation in elevations:
    camera.set_elevation(elevation) # Assuming set_elevation is implemented
    camera.look_at(subject_position)
    camera.capture_image(f"elevation_{elevation}.png")

## Feature List

*   **Precise Camera Positioning:** Programmatically control the camera's position in 3D space.
*   **Orientation Control:** Precisely adjust the camera's orientation and viewing angle.
*   **Path Following:** Define and execute camera movements along predefined paths.
*   **Target Tracking:** Maintain focus on a specific target object during camera movements.
*   **Zoom Control:** Simulate zoom effects by adjusting the camera's field of view or distance to the subject.
*   **Extensible API:** Easily integrate custom camera control logic and algorithms.
*   **Image Capture:** (Hypothetical) Integrate with image capture functionalities (to be implemented as needed).
