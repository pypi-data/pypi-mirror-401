## Usage

### Installation

Install latest from the GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/problemsolversguild/psg_recall):

``` sh
$ pip install git+https://github.com/problemsolversguild/psg_recall.git
```

or from [pypi](https://pypi.org/project/psg_recall/)

``` sh
$ pip install psg_recall
```

### Documentation

Documentation can be found hosted on this GitHub
[repository](https://github.com/problemsolversguild/psg_recall)’s
[pages](https://problemsolversguild.github.io/psg_recall/). Additionally
you can find package manager specific guidelines on
[pypi](https://pypi.org/project/psg_recall/).

## How to use

`psg_recall` provides persistent memory storage at three levels:

- **Global** - Memories shared across all projects (stored in
  `~/.solveit_memory/`)
- **Project** - Memories for the current project directory (stored in
  `.memory/`)
- **File** - Memories tied to a specific file (stored in
  `.memory/{filename}_memory.txt`)

``` python
from psg_recall.storage import remember, recall, recall_all, recall_history, forget
```

### Storing memories

Use
[`remember()`](https://problemsolversguild.github.io/psg_recall/storage.html#remember)
to store a key-value pair. By default it stores at the project level:

``` python
# Store a project-level memory
remember("user_name", "Alice")
```

``` python
# Store a global memory (available across all projects)
remember("api_preference", "openai", level="global")
```

``` python
# Store a file-specific memory (context specifies the filename)
remember("last_edit", "fixed bug on line 42", level="file", context="main.py")
```

### Recalling memories

Use
[`recall()`](https://problemsolversguild.github.io/psg_recall/storage.html#recall)
to retrieve memories from a specific level. Returns `None` if the key
doesn’t exist:

``` python
# Recall a specific key from project level
recall(key="user_name")
```

``` python
# Recall all project-level memories
recall()
```

``` python
# Recall from global level
recall(level="global")
```

### Recalling from all levels

Use
[`recall_all()`](https://problemsolversguild.github.io/psg_recall/storage.html#recall_all)
to get memories from global, project, and file levels combined:

``` python
# Get all memories across all levels
print(recall_all(context="main.py"))  # include file context to also get file-level memories
```

### Forgetting memories

Use
[`forget()`](https://problemsolversguild.github.io/psg_recall/storage.html#forget)
to remove a key from memory. This also records the removal in history:

``` python
# Forget a project-level memory
forget("user_name")
```

### Viewing history

Use
[`recall_history()`](https://problemsolversguild.github.io/psg_recall/storage.html#recall_history)
to see past changes to memories, including timestamps and whether values
were remembered or forgotten:

``` python
# View all history for project level
print(recall_history())
```

``` python
# View history for a specific key
print(recall_history(key="user_name"))
```

## Export
