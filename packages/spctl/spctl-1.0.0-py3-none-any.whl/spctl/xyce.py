    Required inputs:
    ----------------
    netlist  (str):     spice netlist or path to a spice netlist.


    Optional inputs:
    ----------------
    is_netlist (bool):  Indicator if netlist is a filepath or actual netlist.
                        Default assumes a path.

    Description
    ----------------
    The Circuit section is a high-level object of any ordinary spice netlist.
    The object allows however to filter the netlist elements by their type
    arguments and ports.

        filename:       When read from file filename, otherwise this can be
                        used a identfier and will be writen to the first line
                        of the netlist object.

        parsed_circuit: This variable holds a string with the original netlist
                        even before variable subsitution.


        circuit:        A list of all the netlist elements in a dict fashion
                        with "instance", "type",  "ports",  "args" keys.

        netlist:        A spice netlist generated from the "circuit" list/dict.
