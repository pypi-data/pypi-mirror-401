"""
    This module defines the FileSystemInterface, which provides an abstract interface for
    file system operations such as folder creation, removal of empty folders, and file listing.
    Implementations should handle logging via the provided log_files parameter and use colour keys
    for consistent output formatting (e.g., !path for paths, !file for filenames, !create for creation actions).
