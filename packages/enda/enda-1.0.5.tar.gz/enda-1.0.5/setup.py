Hence some tools in this package perform TSO (transmission network operator) and DNO (distribution network operator) data wrangling as well as weather data management. enda is mainly developed by [Enercoop](https://www.enercoop.fr/).\n\n## Main Features\n\nHere are some things **enda** does well:\n\n- Provide robust machine learning algorithms for **short-term electricity load and production forecasts**. enda provides a convenient wrapper around the popular multipurpose machine-learning backends [Scikit](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) and [H2O](https://h2o.ai/platform/ai-cloud/make/h2o/). The load forecast was originally based on Komi Nagbe's thesis (<http://www.theses.fr/s148364>).\n- Manipulate **timeseries** data, such as load curves. enda handles timeseries-specific detection of missing data, like time gaps, frequency changes, extra values, as well as various resampling methods. \n- Provide several **backtesting** and **scoring** methods to ensure the quality of the trained algorithm on almost real conditions.\n- Manipulate **contracts** data coming from your ERP and turn it into timeseries you can use for analysis, visualisation and machine learning.\n- Date-time **feature engineering** robust to timezone hazards.\n\n## Where to get it\n\nThe source code is currently hosted on GitHub at: <https://github.com/enercoop/enda>. If you wish to run the examples it contains, you can clone enda from the Github repository\n\nBinary installers for the latest released version are available at the [Python\nPackage Index (PyPI)](https://pypi.org/project/enda) (for now it is not directly on [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/)). \n\n\n```sh\npip install enda\n```\n\nor using [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/):\n\n```sh\npoetry add enda\n```\n\n## Documentation and API\n\nThe complete API is available online [here](https://enercoop.github.io/enda).\n\n\n## How to get started?\n\nFor a more comprehensive approach to enda, several [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) have been proposed in the [guides](<https://github.com/enercoop/enda/tree/main/guides>.).\nSome dependencies are needed to run these examples, that you can easily install with poetry, running ```poetry install enda[examples]```\n\n\n## Dependencies\n\n### Hard dependencies\n\n- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)\n- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)\n- [H2O](https://docs.h2o.ai/)\n- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)\n- [Statsmodels](https://pypi.org/project/statsmodels/)\n- Libraries that are recommended by the previous packages: [datatable](https://pypi.org/project/datatable/), [polars](https://pypi.org/project/polars/), [numexpr](https://pypi.org/project/numexpr/), [unidecode](https://pypi.org/project/Unidecode/)\n- Libraries meant to get calendar data: [jours-feries-france](https://pypi.org/project/jours-feries-france/), [vacances-scolaires-france](https://pypi.org/project/vacances-scolaires-france/)\n\n\n### Optional dependencies\n\nIf you want to run the examples, you may need extra dependencies. \nThese dependencies can be installed using poetry: \n\n```sh\npoetry install --with examples\n```\n\nor manually:\n\n```sh\npip install numexpr bottleneck pandas enda jupyter h2o scikit-learn statsmodels joblib matplotlib\n```\n\nAccordingly, if you wish to develop into enda, we suggest some tools and linters that can be used. \n```sh\npoetry install --with dev\n```\n\n## License\n\n[MIT](LICENSE)\n",
