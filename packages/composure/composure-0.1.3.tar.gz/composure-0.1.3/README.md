## What is Composure?

Composure is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) dashboard that helps you:

- **Monitor** all your Docker containers in real-time
- **Detect waste** by comparing actual resource usage vs allocated limits
- **Visualize networks** to see how containers connect to each other
- **Control containers** directly from the terminal (start, stop, restart, view logs)

## Features

- **Resource Monitoring**: See CPU and memory usage for all containers
- **Waste Detection**: Identify over-provisioned containers with waste scores
- **Limit Awareness**: Quickly spot containers without resource limits
- **Network Visualization**: Tree view showing container network topology
- **Container Controls**: Start, stop, restart containers with keyboard shortcuts
- **Live Logs**: View recent logs for any container
- **Parallel Loading**: Fast startup even with many containers

## Installation

### Using pip (recommended)

```bash
pip install composure
```

### Using uv

```bash
uv tool install composure
```

### Using Docker

```bash
docker run -it -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock jamesdimonaco/composure
```

curl -fsSL https://jamesdimonaco.github.io/composure/gpg.key | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/composure.gpg
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/composure.gpg] https://jamesdimonaco.github.io/composure stable main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/composure.list

# Install
sudo apt update
sudo apt install composure
```

### From source

## Usage

Simply run:

```bash
composure
```

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `q` | Quit |
| `r` | Refresh |
| `n` | Toggle network view |
| `s` | Stop selected container |
| `a` | Start selected container |

| `↑/↓` | Navigate containers |

## Understanding the Dashboard

### Main View

```
Container     Status   CPU %  CPU Limit  RAM Used  RAM Limit  Efficiency  Waste
nginx         running  0.5%   2 cores    45 MB     512 MB     LOW         90
api           running  2.1%   No limit   128 MB    256 MB     MEDIUM      40
postgres      running  1.2%   1 core     256 MB    512 MB     GOOD        20
```

### Columns Explained

- **Status**: running, exited, paused, etc.
- **CPU %**: Current CPU usage
- **CPU Limit**: Configured CPU limit (or "No limit")
- **RAM Used**: Current memory usage
- **RAM Limit**: Configured memory limit (or "No limit")
- **Efficiency**: LOW/MEDIUM/GOOD/HIGH based on resource utilization
- **Waste**: 0-100 score (higher = more over-provisioned)

### Waste Score

The waste score helps identify containers that have been allocated far more resources than they're using:

- **0-30** (green): Good utilization
- **30-60** (yellow): Could be optimized
- **60-100** (red): Significantly over-provisioned

### Network View

Press `n` to see a tree view of your Docker networks:

```
Docker Networks
├── Compose Networks
│   └── myapp_default (3 containers)
│       ├── nginx
│       ├── api
│       └── postgres
└── System Networks
    └── bridge (empty)
```
