# sebastos: a sync client for Standard Ebooks

The folks over at [Standard Ebooks](https://standardebooks.org/) provide a fabulous collection of public domain books,
beautifully produced.

I recently purchased a Kobo e-reader, and want to load it with some of those ebooks, getting updates as new books become available, and without having to download and copy a bunch of files. This client makes that easy.
