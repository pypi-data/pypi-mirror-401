    Test column type. Note that regardless of dataframe library, you should give the
    Narwhals (Polars-esque) datatype. For instance, Pandas may store dates internally as
    `np.datetime64`  but Wimsey will determine this type as `Datetime` when running tests.
    This has the benefit of meaning tests should be consistent on the same dataset, when
    ran with different dataframe engines.
