# ATLAS — Deterministic Incident Analysis & Response (CLI)

ATLAS is a **pip-installable CLI tool** for **deterministic incident analysis, root cause analysis (RCA), and response workflows**.  
It ingests real production logs and produces **explainable, auditable outputs** — **without AI / ML**.

**Audience:** SREs, DevOps, Platform engineers  
**Guarantee:** Same input → same output. No black boxes.

---

## Why ATLAS?

Most incident tools rely on opaque AI or heuristics that cannot be trusted during outages.  
ATLAS is built for **predictability, explainability, and production realism**.

* 🔒 Zero-AI (no LLMs, no ML, no embeddings)
* 🧠 Fully deterministic
* 🧾 Rule-based & explainable
* 🧪 100% testable core
* ⚙️ Real CLI workflow (files in → decisions out)

## What ATLAS Does

### ATLAS v1 — Incident Analysis
1. Parses raw logs
2. Normalizes into a canonical incident schema
3. Classifies incident type
4. Infers probable root cause
5. Suggests remediation actions
6. Persists incident history (JSONL)

### ATLAS v2 — Priority & Response Engine
ATLAS v2 converts analyzed incidents into **decisions**.

* Priority scoring (P0–P3)
* Rule-based decisions (IF–THEN)
* Workflow execution (step-by-step)
* State tracking (no infinite loops)
* Full audit trail
* Still zero-AI and deterministic

> v1 answers **“What happened?”**  
> v2 answers **“What should happen next?”**

### Install (PyPI)

```bash
pip install atlas-incident
```
Current version: 0.1.2

### Usage

```bash
python -m atlas <log_file> <service> <environment>
```

### Example:

```bash
python -m atlas prod_payments.log payments-api prod
```

**What happens on run**

1. v1 analyzes logs → Incident

2. v2 assigns priority → runs response workflow


### Example Output

```json
{
  "service": "payments-api",
  "environment": "prod",
  "severity": "LOW",
  "category": "UNKNOWN",
  "root_cause": "Unknown root cause",
  "actions": ["Escalate to on-call engineer"],
  "confidence": 0.6
}

```

```makefile
=== ATLAS v2 RESULT ===
Priority: P2
Actions: []
``` 

**Incident History**

Each run is appended to `incident_history.jsonl.`

- Append-only
- Audit-friendly
- Replayable


### Testing

```bash
pytest
pytest --cov=atlas_v2
```

- Deterministic tests
- Edge-case coverage
- CI-ready



### Design Principles

- Determinism over intelligence
- Rules over models
- Schemas over guesses
- Clarity over cleverness
- Production realism over demos
