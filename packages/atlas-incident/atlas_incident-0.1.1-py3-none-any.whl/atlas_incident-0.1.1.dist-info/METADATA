# ATLAS — Deterministic Incident Analysis & RCA (CLI)

ATLAS is a **pip-installable CLI tool** for **deterministic incident analysis and root cause analysis (RCA)**. It ingests real production logs and produces **explainable JSON reports** with classification, root cause, and concrete actions — **without AI/ML**.

**Audience:** SREs, DevOps, Platform engineers.
**Guarantee:** Same input → same output. Auditable rules. Zero black boxes.

---

## Why ATLAS?

Most incident tools rely on black‑box AI or heuristics that cannot be trusted under pressure. ATLAS takes the opposite approach:

* 🔒 **Zero‑AI** (no LLMs, no ML, no embeddings)
* 🧠 **Fully deterministic** (same input → same output)
* 🧾 **Explainable decisions** (rule‑based logic)
* 🧪 **100% testable** core pipeline
* ⚙️ **Real‑world workflow** (file‑based CLI + JSON output)

---

## What ATLAS Does

1. Parses raw production logs
2. Normalizes them into a canonical incident schema
3. Classifies the incident (DB, Network, Auth, etc.)
4. Infers probable root cause via rule chains
5. Suggests concrete remediation actions
6. Persists incident history for audit & comparison

## Install (PyPI)

```bash
pip install atlas-incident
```

Run:

```bash
atlas <log_file> <service> <environment>
```

---

## Usage (Real‑World Workflow)

### 1️⃣ Create a production‑like log file

```text
2024-10-12T09:14:01Z INFO  payments-api Starting service
2024-10-12T09:14:05Z INFO  payments-api Connected to postgres
2024-10-12T09:15:22Z WARN  payments-api Slow query detected
2024-10-12T09:16:10Z ERROR payments-api Database connection timeout
2024-10-12T09:16:15Z ERROR payments-api Retries exhausted
```

### 2️⃣ Run ATLAS

```bash
python -m atlas prod_payments.log payments-api prod
```

### 3️⃣ Example Output (JSON)

```json
{
  "service": "payments-api",
  "environment": "prod",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "category": "DATABASE",
  "root_cause": "Connection pool exhausted",
  "actions": [
    "Increase database connection pool size",
    "Restart affected service",
    "Monitor latency for 15 minutes"
  ],
  "confidence": 1.0
}
```

---

## Incident History (Persistence)

Each run is appended to `incident_history.jsonl`:

```json
{"service":"payments-api","environment":"prod","severity":"HIGH","category":"DATABASE","root_cause":"Connection pool exhausted",...}
```

* Append‑only
* Audit‑friendly
* Replayable for future analysis

---

## Testing

Run the full test suite:

```bash
pytest -v
```

All core modules are covered with deterministic tests.

---

## Design Principles

* Determinism over intelligence
* Rules over models
* Schemas over guesses
* Clarity over cleverness
* Production realism over demos

---


## Future Scope

ATLAS is intentionally minimal and deterministic. Potential future extensions include:

* Configurable rule sets (YAML-based)
* Additional log format parsers (NGINX, Kubernetes, Cloud logs)
* Enhanced similarity matching using statistical techniques (still non-AI)
* Optional output formats (Markdown / HTML reports)
* Integration hooks for alerting or ticketing systems

> Any future additions will preserve ATLAS’s core principles: determinism, explainability, and zero-AI design.
