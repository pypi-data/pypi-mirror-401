## What It Does

Automatically connects Airflow task executions to incident correlation:

- Emits OpenLineage events for task lifecycle (START/COMPLETE/FAIL)
- Links task failures to upstream data quality issues
- Provides direct navigation from incident to root cause
- Works with your existing OpenLineage infrastructure

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install correlator-airflow

# Configure endpoint
export CORRELATOR_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080/api/v1/lineage/events

# Enable in Airflow (see Configuration docs)
```

That's it. Your Airflow task executions are now being correlated.

---

## How It Works

`airflow-correlator` hooks into Airflow's task lifecycle and emits OpenLineage events:

1. **Task Starts** - Emits START event with task metadata
2. **Task Completes** - Emits COMPLETE event with execution details
3. **Task Fails** - Emits FAIL event with error information

Events are sent to Correlator (or any OpenLineage-compatible backend) for correlation with dbt tests, Great Expectations validations, and other data quality signals.

See [Architecture](docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) for technical details.

---

## Why It Matters

**The Problem:** When data pipelines fail, teams spend significant time manually hunting through Airflow logs, lineage graphs, and job histories to find the root cause.

**What You Get:** Automated correlation between Airflow task executions and data quality test results, putting you in control of incidents instead of reacting to them.

**Key Benefits:**

- **Faster incident resolution**: Automated correlation reduces investigation time
- **Eliminate tool switching**: One correlation view instead of navigating multiple dashboards
- **Instant root cause**: Direct path from task failure to problematic upstream job
- **Zero-friction setup**: Simple configuration, no code changes required

**Built on Standards:** Uses OpenLineage, the industry standard for data lineage. No vendor lock-in, no proprietary formats.

## Current Status

> **Note:** This is a skeleton release (v0.0.0) for pipeline testing and PyPI name reservation. All functionality returns placeholder messages. Full implementation coming soon.

---

## Versioning

This package follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) with the following guidelines:

- **0.x.y versions** (e.g., 0.1.0, 0.2.0) indicate **initial development phase**:
  - The API is not yet stable and may change between minor versions
  - Features may be added, modified, or removed without major version changes
  - Not recommended for production-critical systems without pinned versions

- **1.0.0 and above** will indicate a **stable API** with semantic versioning guarantees:
  - MAJOR version for incompatible API changes
  - MINOR version for backwards-compatible functionality additions
  - PATCH version for backwards-compatible bug fixes

The current version is in early development stage, so expect possible API changes until the 1.0.0 release.
