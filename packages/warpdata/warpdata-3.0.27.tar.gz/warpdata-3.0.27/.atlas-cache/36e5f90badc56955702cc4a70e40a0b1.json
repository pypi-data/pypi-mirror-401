  "summary": "This folder implements the core artifact resolution engine for the WarpData ecosystem, enabling efficient access to sharded data. It provides a sophisticated layer that maps abstract artifact references to physical bytes using Parquet-based indices, supporting local, S3, and HTTP storage backends with integrated caching and hybrid-mode auto-downloading.",
