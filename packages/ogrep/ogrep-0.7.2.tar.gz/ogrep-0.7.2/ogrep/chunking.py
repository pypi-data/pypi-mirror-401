Text chunking module for ogrep.

    """
    Split text into overlapping chunks by line count.

    Creates chunks of approximately chunk_size lines with overlap lines
    of context shared between adjacent chunks. This overlap helps preserve
    context for code that spans chunk boundaries.

    Args:
        text: Source text to chunk.
        chunk_size: Target number of lines per chunk (default: 120).
        overlap: Number of lines to overlap between chunks (default: 20).
            Should be less than chunk_size.

    Returns:
        List of Chunk objects. Empty chunks are filtered out.

    Example:
        >>> text = "line1\\nline2\\nline3\\nline4\\nline5"
        >>> chunks = chunk_lines(text, chunk_size=2, overlap=1)
        >>> len(chunks)
        3
        >>> chunks[0].text
        'line1\\nline2'
        >>> chunks[1].start_line
        2

    Note:
        Line numbers in chunks are 1-indexed to match editor conventions.
        The overlap ensures context is preserved: if you search for
        something near a chunk boundary, relevant context from the
        adjacent chunk will also be included.
