# CODEOWNERS: Controls automatic assignment of reviewers for pull requests.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# When a pull request modifies files matching a pattern, the listed code owners will be requested as reviewers.
# Each line is a file pattern followed by one or more code owners (users or teams) who must review changes to that file.
# Do not edit unless specifically mandated to do so.

# Global/fallback and technical modifications.
