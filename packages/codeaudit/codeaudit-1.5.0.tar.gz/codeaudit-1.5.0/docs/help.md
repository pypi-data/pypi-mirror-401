## Promote Your Commitment to Python Code Audit


* [Support this work](sponsors)

* If you use **Python Code Audit**, showcase your dedication to secure coding by adding the badge ![PythonCodeAudit Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20Code%20Audit-Security%20Verified-FF0000?style=flat-square) to your public repository.
Displaying the badge signals that you take Python security seriously and have proactively audited your code for potential vulnerabilities.

You can display the badge, ![PythonCodeAudit Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20Code%20Audit-Security%20Verified-FF0000?style=flat-square), by embedding the following snippet in your Markdown file:

```markdown
[![PythonCodeAudit Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20Code%20Audit-Security%20Verified-FF0000?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/nocomplexity/codeaudit)
```
Or by embedding this in your HTML page:

```html
<href="https://github.com/nocomplexity/codeaudit"><img alt="PythonCodeAudit Badge" src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Python%20Code%20Audit-Security%20Verified-FF0000?style=flat-square"></a>
```

:::{admonition} When using the Python Code Audit badge, inform your users!
:class: tip, dropdown

When you use **Python Code Audit**, you are in control.

No AI agent should decide what is necessary — only you fully understand your design and its complete context.

You should carefully evaluate all reported weaknesses. 

Not every issue requires fixing; depending on your program and the environment in which it operates, **some detected weaknesses may not be relevant**.

However, it is important to document your decisions and inform your users about the design choices you have made and the rationale behind them.
