Not a coder? Not a problem! **Python Code Audit** is multifaceted, so I always can use help. 
These are all activities we’d like to get help with :
- Writing and improving the documentation 
- Code maintenance and development
- Community coordination
- Advocating Python secure programming 
- Developing educational content 
- Fundraising 
- Marketing
- Project management
- Translating content
- Website design and development
:::

The **Codeaudit** code repository is hosted at [Github](https://github.com/nocomplexity/codeaudit).

Simple Guidelines:

* Questions, Feature Requests, Bug Reports should all be reported on the [Github Issue Tracker](https://github.com/nocomplexity/codeaudit/issues) .
* [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) is used for code style. But for a simple fix, using `Black` is not required!

This codeaudit tool is designed by applying [Zero Complexity By Design principles](https://nocomplexity.com/documents/0complexity/abstract.html). So the goal is to keep the tool simple to use and the code simple to adjust or to extend.

:::{warning}
This simple tool is designed to be simple to use and maintain.
