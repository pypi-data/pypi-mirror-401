# Installation

Python Code Audit is compatible with both Unix-based systems (Linux/macOS) and Windows.


To install or upgrade to the latest version, run the following command in your terminal or command prompt:

```bash
pip install -U codeaudit
```

Once the installation is complete, you can begin scanning Python Packages immediately. Open a new shell or Command Prompt window and execute any of the Python Code Audit commands to verify the setup.

Example:

```bash
codeaudit filescan ultrafastrss
```
This will scan the `ultrafastrss` package directly from PyPI.org and create a html report.


:::{hint} 
It is recommended to use `pip` for installation.
