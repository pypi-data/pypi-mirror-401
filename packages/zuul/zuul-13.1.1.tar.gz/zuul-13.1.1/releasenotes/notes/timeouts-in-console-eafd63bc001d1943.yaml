    Zuul will now record a notice in the job-output.json for Ansible
    playbooks that fail to do so themselves. This can happen if Ansible
    crashes or is forced to stop by Zuul due to timeouts. The information
    is minimal, but should give users an indication in the web ui console
    of why certain plays are not recorded.
