features:
  - |
    A new configuration setting, ``replication_delay`` has been added to
    the Gerrit driver. Some Gerrit installations consist of multiple
    servers with various strategies for keeping these servers in sync
    (push replication, pull replication, multi-master, shared storage,
    etc.).  Since there is currently no reliable method to determine
    when all servers are updated, this setting may be used to
    introduce a delay in event processing.  Zuul will ensure that at
    least this amount of time (in seconds) has passed before
    processing the corresponding event.
deprecations:
  - |
    The ``replication_timeout`` setting for the Gerrit driver is now
    ignored and should be removed from ``zuul.conf`` files.  See the
    new ``replication_delay`` setting for an alternative.
