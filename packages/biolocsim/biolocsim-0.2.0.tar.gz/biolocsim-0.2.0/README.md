A Python library for simulating SMLM point cloud data.

* Documentation: <https://sylvanding.github.io/biolocsim>
* GitHub: <https://github.com/sylvanding/biolocsim>
* PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/biolocsim/>
* Free software: MIT

---

## Features

* **Simulate Biological Structures**: Generate 3D point cloud data for:
  * **Microtubules**: Modeled using B-splines for smooth, realistic curves.
  * **Mitochondria**: Simulated with a persistent random walk model to create complex, branching shapes.
  * **Nuclear Pore Complexes (NPCs)**: Simulated with 8-fold symmetry, realistic error models (localization uncertainty, linker error, binding site jitter), and support for multiple NPCs on a nuclear envelope.
* **Point Cloud Rendering**: Convert 3D point clouds into 2D microscopy-style images, complete with PSF convolution and background noise simulation.
* **Mask Generation**:
  * **Microtubules**: Create 2D and 3D centerline masks for ground truth generation.
  * **Mitochondria**: Produce 3D volume grids, surface masks, and 2D projection masks.
* **Flexible Configuration**: Easily adjust simulation parameters (volume size, point density, structure-specific attributes) through configuration files.
* **Batch Processing**: Automate the generation of large datasets with a command-line interface for running simulations in parallel.

## Installation

There are two primary ways to install `biolocsim`, depending on your use case.

### For Users: Install from PyPI

If you intend to use `biolocsim` as a library in your own projects, the easiest way is to install the latest stable release from PyPI.

```bash
# Create a new conda environment with Python 3.10
conda create -n biolocsim python=3.10 -y
conda activate biolocsim

# Install biolocsim
pip install biolocsim
```

### For Developers: Install from Source

If you want to contribute to `biolocsim`, run the examples, or use the latest development version, you should install it from the source code.

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/sylvanding/biolocsim.git
    cd biolocsim
    ```

2. **Create a development environment:**
    We recommend using `conda` for environment management to ensure consistency.

    ```bash
    # Create a new conda environment with Python 3.10
    conda create -n biolocsim-dev python=3.10 -y
    conda activate biolocsim-dev
    ```

3. **Install dependencies using Poetry:**
    This project uses [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage dependencies. First, install Poetry itself:

    ```bash
    pip install poetry
    ```

    Then, install the project and its dependencies with `poetry.lock` (recommended):

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

    or without `poetry.lock`, including tools for development, testing, and documentation (not recommended):

    ```bash
    poetry install -E doc -E dev -E test
    ```

4. **Verify the installation (optional):**
    You can run the full test suite with `tox` to make sure everything is set up correctly.

    ```bash
    poetry run tox
    ```

    This will run tests and code style checks.

## Usage Examples

This library includes examples for generating single structures and running batch simulations. You can find them in the `examples/` directory.

### Generating Single Structures

To generate a single structure, you can run the corresponding script from the `examples/` directory.

```bash
# Generate microtubules
python examples/generate_microtubules.py

# Generate mitochondria
python examples/generate_mitochondria.py

# Generate a single Nuclear Pore Complex
python examples/generate_npc.py

# Generate multiple NPCs on a nuclear envelope
python examples/generate_npc_nucleus.py
```

The output, including the point cloud (CSV), rendered images (PNG/TIFF), and masks, will be saved in the `outputs/` directory.

### Batch Generation

For generating a large dataset, the `batch_generate.py` script allows running multiple simulations in parallel.

```bash
# Run 4 parallel simulations for microtubules
python examples/batch_generate.py microtubule -n 4 -w 4

# Run 8 parallel simulations for mitochondria
python examples/batch_generate.py mitochondria -n 8 -w 4

# Run 10 single NPC simulations
python examples/batch_generate.py npc -n 10 -w 4

# Run 5 nucleus (multiple NPCs) simulations
python examples/batch_generate.py nucleus -n 5 -w 4
```

You can specify the structure type (`microtubule`, `mitochondria`, `npc`, or `nucleus`), the total number of simulations (`-n`), and the number of parallel workers (`-w`). The results will be saved in subdirectories within `outputs/batch_simulation/`.
