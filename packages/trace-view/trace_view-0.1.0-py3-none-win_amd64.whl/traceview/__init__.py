        pass

Usage with OpenTelemetry auto-configuration:

    from traceview import Traceview

    with Traceview(configure_otel=True) as tv:
        # OpenTelemetry is configured to send traces to traceview
        tracer = trace.get_tracer(__name__)
        with tracer.start_as_current_span("my-span"):
            pass
