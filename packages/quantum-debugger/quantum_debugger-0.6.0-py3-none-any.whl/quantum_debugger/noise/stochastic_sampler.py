"""
Stochastic noise simulation for large quantum circuits

For circuits with >10 qubits, density matrices become impractical (>8MB memory).
Stochastic sampling simulates noise by randomly applying Kraus operators based on
their probabilities, trading exact simulation for scalability.

    """
    Stochastic noise sampler for large circuits
    
    Uses Monte Carlo sampling to approximate noisy evolution without
    requiring density matrices. Suitable for circuits with >10 qubits.
    
    Algorithm:
    1. Start with pure state |ψ⟩
    2. For each gate + noise:
       - Apply gate to |ψ⟩
       - Randomly choose Kraus operator based on probabilities
       - Apply chosen Kraus operator
       - Renormalize
    3. Repeat for multiple shots to estimate statistics
