"""
Terminal Internal Connections (Bridges) Utilities.

This module provides utilities for managing internal connections between
terminal pins. Internal connections (bridges) represent physical jumpers
or connections between pins on terminal strips.

Key Concepts:
    - Bridge Range: A tuple (start, end) representing connected pins
    - Connection Definition: Either "all" (all pins connected) or a list of ranges

Example Usage:
    # Define internal connections for a project
    connections = {
        "X001": [(1, 2), (5, 8)],  # Pins 1-2 bridged, pins 5-8 bridged
        "X103": "all",              # All pins on X103 are bridged
    }

    # Parse existing terminal data and add bridge info
    terminal_pins = parse_terminal_pins_from_csv("terminals.csv")
    update_csv_with_internal_connections("terminals.csv", connections)

def expand_range_to_pins(start: int, end: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Expand a (start, end) range to list of all pins in between.

    Since bridges physically connect all pins between start and end,
    this function returns all pins that would be connected.

    Args:
        start: First pin in bridge
        end: Last pin in bridge

    Returns:
        List of all pins from start to end inclusive
