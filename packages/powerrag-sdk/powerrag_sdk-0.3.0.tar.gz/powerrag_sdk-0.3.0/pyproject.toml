# Package configuration
# IMPORTANT: Build must be run from repository root (not from powerrag/sdk/)
# This ensures the package path 'powerrag.sdk' is correctly resolved
# Build workflow: GitHub Action copies this file to root and runs poetry build
# Import path: from powerrag.sdk import PowerRAGClient
