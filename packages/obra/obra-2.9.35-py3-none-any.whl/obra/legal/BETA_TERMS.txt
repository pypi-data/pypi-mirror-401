--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
23. ARBITRATION AGREEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PLEASE READ THIS SECTION CAREFULLY. IT REQUIRES YOU TO RESOLVE DISPUTES
WITH US THROUGH INDIVIDUAL BINDING ARBITRATION AND LIMITS THE MANNER IN
WHICH YOU CAN SEEK RELIEF.

23.1 Agreement to Arbitrate
Any dispute, claim, or controversy arising out of or relating to this
Agreement or your use of the Software (collectively, "Disputes") shall be
resolved exclusively through binding arbitration administered by the
American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its Commercial Arbitration
Rules.

23.2 Arbitrability
The arbitrator shall have exclusive authority to resolve any dispute
relating to the interpretation, applicability, enforceability, or
formation of this arbitration agreement, including any claim that all
or part of this arbitration agreement is void or voidable.

23.3 Federal Arbitration Act
The Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) governs the interpretation and enforcement
of this arbitration agreement. Delaware law governs all other aspects of
the dispute, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.

23.4 Location
Arbitration will take place in Wilmington, Delaware, unless otherwise
mutually agreed by the parties.

23.5 Individual Proceedings Only
Disputes will be arbitrated only on an individual basis and will not be
consolidated with any other arbitration or proceeding.

23.6 No Class Actions
You and we agree that the Class Action Waiver in Section 25 (Class Action
Waiver, Jury Waiver, and Representative Proceedings) applies to all
arbitration proceedings.

23.7 Exceptions
Either party may bring an individual claim in small claims court (if the
claim qualifies) or seek injunctive relief in a court of competent
jurisdiction regarding infringement or misappropriation of intellectual property.

23.8 Costs
Each party shall bear its own costs and attorneys' fees. The arbitrator
shall have no authority to award costs or attorneys' fees to either party
regardless of the outcome, except as required by non-waivable law. To the
extent any fee-shifting is required by non-waivable law, such award shall
be limited to the minimum amount required by such law. Initial filing fees
shall be allocated in accordance with AAA Commercial Arbitration Rules.
For claims under $10,000, we will pay all AAA filing and administration
fees if the arbitrator finds you cannot afford them.

Nothing in this Section limits your indemnification obligations under
Section 18 (Indemnification), which operates independently of arbitration
fee allocation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
24. GOVERNING LAW
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Except as provided in Section 23 (Arbitration Agreement), this Agreement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State
of Delaware, United States, without regard to conflict of law principles.

For matters not subject to arbitration, you consent to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the state or federal courts located in Delaware.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
25. CLASS ACTION WAIVER, JURY WAIVER, AND REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDINGS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CLASS ACTION WAIVER:
YOU AGREE THAT ANY DISPUTE RESOLUTION PROCEEDINGS, WHETHER IN ARBITRATION
OR COURT, WILL BE CONDUCTED ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT IN A CLASS,
CONSOLIDATED, OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION.

You waive any right to participate in a class action lawsuit or class-wide
arbitration against us. You waive any right to bring claims on behalf of
others or as part of a group.

If any court or arbitrator determines that this class action waiver is
void or unenforceable for any reason, or that any claim may proceed on
a class basis, then the arbitration provisions of Section 23 shall be
deemed null and void in their entirety, and the parties shall be deemed
to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

JURY WAIVER:
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, EACH PARTY WAIVES ANY RIGHT TO
A JURY TRIAL IN ANY ACTION OR PROCEEDING ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO
THIS AGREEMENT.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
26. MODIFICATIONS TO TERMS
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  * These terms MAY BE MODIFIED at any time
  * Material modifications affecting your rights or obligations will be
    communicated via email or prominent notice at least fourteen (14) days
    before taking effect
  * Non-material modifications are effective immediately upon posting

    acceptance if prompted, constitutes acceptance of the modified terms
  * For material modifications, we may require you to re-accept the updated
    terms before further use of the Software
  * It is your responsibility to review these terms periodically
  * If you do not agree to modified terms, you must stop using the Software

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
27. SEVERABILITY
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If any provision of these terms is found to be invalid, illegal, or
unenforceable by a court of competent jurisdiction or arbitrator, such
finding shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions, which
shall continue in full force and effect. If any provision is found overbroad
or unenforceable, the court or arbitrator is authorized to reform such
provision to the minimum extent necessary to render it enforceable while
preserving the parties' intent.

This Agreement shall be interpreted fairly in accordance with its terms,
without any presumption for or against either party as drafter.

Section headings are for convenience only and shall not affect the
interpretation or construction of this Agreement.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
28. PRECEDENCE
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and any other
documentation, marketing materials, or communications regarding the
Software, the terms of this Agreement shall control and take precedence.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
29. ENTIRE AGREEMENT
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This Agreement, together with our Privacy Policy, constitutes the entire
agreement between you and the Authors regarding your use of this Software
and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous agreements, understandings,
representations, and warranties, whether written or oral.

Modifications to the Privacy Policy shall follow the notice procedures
set forth in Section 26 (Modifications to Terms) of this Agreement to the
extent such modifications materially affect your rights or obligations.

No waiver of any provision shall be deemed a waiver of any other provision,
and no waiver shall constitute a continuing waiver.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

    or obligations under this Agreement without our prior written consent

  * You are responsible for maintaining a current email address and monitoring
    for notices
  * Notices are effective upon sending or posting
  * You are solely responsible for ensuring we have a current, valid email
    address for your account; failure to receive a notice due to an incorrect

  * We are not required to provide individual notice for modifications to
    this Agreement; posting updated terms constitutes sufficient notice
  * For modifications to this Agreement, the notice effectiveness provision
    of this Section 31 governs when notice is deemed delivered; Section 26
    governs when such modifications take effect

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
32. INDEPENDENT PARTIES
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The parties are independent contractors. Nothing in this Agreement creates
any agency, partnership, joint venture, employer-employee, or franchisor-
franchisee relationship between you and the Authors. Neither party has
