    "\n",
    "Pick a model that you can run locally based on your hardware and download it from your terminal. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "16-24GB RAM -> qwen2.5:14b (Recommended for Agents), granite3.3:8b, or gemma3:12b with ~10–20k context length\n",

    "24+GB RAM -> `mistral-small3.2:24b` or `devstral:24b` with ~20k+ context length\n",
    "\n",
    "**_NOTE:_** Smaller models have shown to be more inconsistent and less capable, especially as task complexity increases. If you have the hardware, we highly recommend using the larger models like `mistral-small3.2:24b` for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Serving the model with the appropriate context length\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, Ollama forces a context length of 8192 tokens to all models, which is not enough for our agent to work properly.\n",
    "We can simply pass to the AgentConfig of `any-agent` as a model argument (`num_ctx` is ollama-specific) our desired value of context length like so:\n",
    "```\n",

    "        tools=[mcp_filesystem, show_plan],\n",
    "        model_args={\"num_ctx\": 32000},\n",
    "    )\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "References: [AgentConfig](https://mozilla-ai.github.io/any-agent/api/config/), [num_ctx](https://github.com/ollama/ollama/blob/main/docs/modelfile.md#valid-parameters-and-values)\n",
    "\n",
    "All four of the models above have a max context length of 128k tokens, but if you have limited RAM if you\n",
    "set it to 128k it might cause you memory issues. For this example, we will set it to 32,000 tokens and provide a relatively small codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Load the model\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, download the Ollama model locally:\n",
