# TorchMorph

*TorchMorph* is a PyTorch utility library developed for handling coordinate
mappings between images (2D or 3D).

Developed originally for medical imaging, this library provides a set of classes
and functions for handling spatial coordinate transformations.

The most powerful feature of this library is the ability to easily compose
transformations lazily and resample them to different coordinate systems as well
as sampler classes for sampling volumes defined on regular grids such that the
optimal method (either slicing operation, convolution, or torch.grid_sample) is
used based on the sampling locations.

The main idea was to develop a library that allows handling of the coordinate
mappings as if they were mathematical functions, without losing much performance
compared to more manual implementation.
