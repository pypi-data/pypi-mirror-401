"""Library for handling spatial coordinate transformations in PyTorch.

Developed originally for medical imaging, this library provides a set of classes
and functions for handling spatial coordinate transformations.

The most powerful feature of this library is the ability to easily compose
transformations lazily and resample them to different coordinate systems as well
as sampler classes for sampling volumes defined on regular grids such that the
optimal method (either slicing operation, convolution, or torch.grid_sample) is
used based on the sampling locations.

The main idea was to develop a library that allows handling of the coordinate
mappings as if they were mathematical functions, without losing much performance
compared to more manual implementation.

In this codebase tensor shapes are seen as consisting of three parts (in the
following order): batch dimension, channel dimensions and spatial dimensions.
The split is defined by providing the number of channel dimensions with the
assumption that there is at most one batch dimension. If the number of
dimensions equals the number of channel dimensions, the batch dimension is
assumed to be empty. Codebase implements custom broadcasting operations which
applies normal broadcasting separately to each split. This makes many operations
easier as one does not have to for example worry about unsqueezing correct
number of dimensions to apply the same operation over all spatial and batch
dimensions.
