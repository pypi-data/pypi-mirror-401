/**
 * Low-level JNI wrapper for ihist native library.
 *
 * <p>This class provides direct access to the ihist C API functions.
 * For most use cases, prefer the high-level {@link HistogramRequest} API.
 *
 * <p><b>Important:</b> The histogram is <b>accumulated</b> into the output
 * buffer. Existing values are added to, not replaced. To obtain a fresh
 * histogram, zero-initialize the buffer before calling these methods.
 *
 * <p><b>Note on signed types:</b> Java's {@code byte} type is signed (-128 to
 * 127), but image pixels are typically unsigned (0 to 255). The native code
 * correctly interprets the bit patterns as unsigned values. Similarly for
 * {@code short} with 16-bit images.
 *
 * <p><b>Buffer requirements:</b> These methods accept both direct buffers and
 * array-backed buffers (such as those created by {@code ByteBuffer.wrap()}).
 * Array-backed buffers only work if their {@code hasArray()} method returns
 * {@code true}; this means read-only heap buffers do not work, nor do short
 * buffers obtained from a heap byte buffer via {@code asShortBuffer()}.
 * Use {@link HistogramRequest} if you need to work with such buffers.
