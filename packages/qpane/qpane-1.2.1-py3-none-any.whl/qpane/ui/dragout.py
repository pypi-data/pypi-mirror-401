    Args:
        qpane: QPane initiating the drag; must expose ``currentImagePath`` and ``original_image``.
        event: Mouse event forwarded from Qt; accepted only to match the slot signature.

    Side effects:
        Emits a ``QDrag`` with the current image file so external apps can receive the payload.
        Generates a preview pixmap sized to roughly 15% of the active screen for continuity with the live view.
    Notes:
        The camelCase name aligns with Qt signal wiring (``drag_start_maybe_requested``), so callers do not need shims.
