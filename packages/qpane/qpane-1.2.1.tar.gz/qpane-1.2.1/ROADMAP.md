# QPane Roadmap

This roadmap captures ideas on deck after the 1.0 release. It's not me making promises, but it's where I see Pane going the next time I dump a lot of time into it.

## Guiding Principles

- Dependencies stay light. The core viewer remains PySide6-only, with `psutil` used
  solely for reactive cache logic when enabled.
- OpenCV remains the primary dependency for editing workflows (already required
  for masking), so new editing features should build on it rather than adding
  heavy alternatives.
- Torch is always optional, reserved for SAM or other AI-backed tools, and never
  required by the core viewer.

## Performance Hunting (Rendering Path)

Goal: keep tightening the hot paths anywhere they show up. This is a standing
invite to optimize the rendering pipeline and adjacent systems when you find
a real win.

Possible integration points
- `qpane/rendering/`: tile composition, buffer reuse, dirty-region math.
- `qpane/swap/`: scheduling, cache hit rate improvements, prefetch heuristics.
- `qpane/cache/`: memory accounting or eviction logic improvements.

Key behaviors to define
- Improvements must be measurable and not regress image fidelity.

Testing focus (when implemented)
- Before/after benchmarks that capture visible wins (latency, memory, FPS).

## Prefetch 2.0 (Never Interrupt the User)

Goal: prefetch the catalog over time without stealing cycles from navigation or
inspection. User-path work should always win, with dedicated lanes for
background prefetch that never interrupt the viewer.

Possible integration points
- `qpane/concurrency/`: introduce dedicated worker lanes for user vs background work.
- `qpane/swap/`: expand scheduling to support idle prefetch waves and priority rules.
- `qpane/core/config.py`: host-configurable depth and caps for prefetch behavior.

Key behaviors to define
- User actions always preempt background work.
- Hosts can choose how aggressive prefetching should be.

Testing focus (when implemented)
- No regressions in navigation responsiveness under heavy background work.

## Enhance Input: Touch & Gesture, Add Mapping API

Goal: make QPane feel native on touch screens, trackpads, and pen input (pinch-to-zoom,
two-finger pan, etc) while refactoring input into a
first-class domain so hosts can define keybindings and interaction rules without
reaching into tool internals.

Possible integration points
- `qpane/qpane.py`: accept gesture/touch events at the widget boundary and forward them into the
  interaction layer (consider `event()` override or explicit `gestureEvent`/`touchEvent` hooks).
- `qpane/ui/widget_props.py`: enable Qt touch attributes (`Qt.WA_AcceptTouchEvents`) and
  `grabGesture(Qt.PinchGesture)`/`Qt.PanGesture` where appropriate.
- `qpane/tools/delegate.py` and `qpane/tools/base.py`: add a gesture/keybinding dispatch path
  alongside wheel/mouse events so tools can opt in without polluting QPane.
- `qpane/rendering/viewport.py`: support anchor-aware zoom from pinch scale deltas and smooth
  pan updates from gesture deltas.
- `qpane/input/`: move input orchestration into a dedicated domain module so the widget stays
  thin while input policies, mappings, and gesture normalization live in one place.
- `qpane/core/` + `qpane/qpane.pyi`: introduce a public-facing input mapping surface that lets
  hosts register shortcuts or replace default bindings without touching tool classes.
- `qpane/core/config.py`: optional config flags to enable/disable touch gestures and tune
  sensitivities without breaking existing mouse-centric defaults.
- Trinity updates: evolve `qpane.pyi`, `qpane.py`, `docs/`, and `examples/` together for any new
  input mapping API surface, with tutorialized demos that stick to the public API.

Key behaviors to define
- Pinch-to-zoom anchored to the gesture center, with clamped zoom limits and DPI-correct scaling.
- Two-finger pan that respects drag-out rules and placeholder modes.
- Gesture priority rules
- Host-configurable shortcuts for mode switching and "hold to pan" without custom event filters.
- Clear fallbacks when the host platform does not emit pinch/pan gestures.

Testing focus (when implemented)
- Touch-enabled devices and trackpads across Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- Pen tablets and stylus input (pressure-agnostic baseline, smooth pan/zoom handoffs).
- Mixed input: pen + touch + mouse in the same session.
- No regressions in existing wheel zoom or drag-out behavior.

## Expand SAM Model Support (CPU-First)

Goal: support more SAM variants so hosts can choose the tradeoffs they want.
MobileSAM stays the default because it is the fastest on CPU, but other models
should be easy to swap in.

Possible integration points
- `qpane/sam/`: abstract model selection and model-specific metadata.
- `qpane/core/config.py`: allow hosts to select a model and configure weights.

Key behaviors to define
- CPU-first defaults remain unchanged.
- Model selection is explicit and documented.

Testing focus (when implemented)
- Existing MobileSAM workflows remain stable.

## Split QPane Into a Core Viewer + Feature Packages

Goal: keep the core viewer lean and make masks/SAM their own packages so advanced
features can evolve independently without bloating the base install.

Possible integration points
- `qpane/`: keep the viewer-only facade with minimal dependencies.
- `qpane/masks/` + `qpane/sam/`: move into feature packages with explicit extras.
- Packaging: introduce optional installs that pull in masks/SAM separately.

Key behaviors to define
- Core viewer remains fully functional without masks/SAM.
- Feature packages plug in cleanly through the public API without private hooks.

Testing focus (when implemented)
- Core viewer installs cleanly with only PySide6.
- Feature packages integrate without changing existing host code.

## Introduce Layer Abstraction (Rendering + Data Model Refactor)

Goal: unify QPane's rendering pipeline around a first-class Layer concept so images,
masks, and future adjustment layers share one compositing model. The north star is
supporting multiple image layers per catalog entry (e.g., A/B comparisons, blended
exposures). This refactor must not change the public API; the only goals are
improved performance and a unified rendering path across domains, while keeping
viewer-only mode intact.

Possible integration points
- `qpane/catalog/`: evolve `CatalogEntry` and `ImageCatalog` to allow a stack of
  layer descriptors per entry rather than a single image/path pairing.
- `qpane/rendering/`: replace the "base image + overlays" split with a compositing
  pipeline that renders ordered layers (image, mask, adjustment) in one pass.
- `qpane/masks/`: adapt mask layers to conform to a shared Layer interface so
  they can participate in ordering, blending, and visibility rules.
- `qpane/swap/`: teach swap/prefetch logic to schedule layer assets (pyramids,
  masks, previews) instead of only base images.
- `qpane/core/` + `qpane/qpane.pyi`: expose public layer APIs (query, reorder,
  visibility, blend settings) while keeping QPane as a thin facade.
- Trinity updates: evolve `qpane.pyi`, `qpane.py`, `docs/`, and `examples/`
  together for any new layer API surface with tutorialized demos.

Key behaviors to define
- Layer ordering, visibility toggles, and blend/opacity rules across types.
- Multi-image entries: how shared pan/zoom, hit testing, and caching behave.
- Backward compatibility path: map the single-image model to a default base layer.
- Layer metadata should be extensible enough to support future adjustment and
  editing tool layers without reworking the core model.

Testing focus (when implemented)
- Correct visual ordering for stacked image + mask + adjustment layers.
- Catalog navigation and swap stability with multi-layer entries.
- Performance of tiling/pyramids when multiple image layers are active.
- Viewer-only mode remains identical in behavior, performance, and API surface.

## Modularize Core Infrastructure (Concurrency + Cache)

Goal: split QPane’s concurrency executor and cache coordination into standalone
packages so host apps can reuse the same architecture without pulling the full viewer.

Possible integration points
- `qpane/concurrency/`: extract TaskExecutor, policies, and retry hooks into a dedicated package.
- `qpane/cache/`: lift cache coordinator + registry into its own package with minimal dependencies.
- `qpane/core/`: keep QPane as a thin integration layer and treat the extracted packages as optional runtime deps.

Key behaviors to define
- Stable public APIs for the new packages.
- QPane remains a consumer, not the owner.

Testing focus (when implemented)
- Backward compatibility for QPane.
- Standalone adoption in non-QPane apps.

## Adjustment Layers (Non-Destructive Editing)

Goal: introduce parameterized adjustment layers (levels, curves, color balance,
exposure, LUT) that sit in the layer stack and render without altering base pixels.
These should be composited alongside image/mask layers to power non-destructive
workflows and future editing tools.

Possible integration points
- `qpane/rendering/`: extend the render pipeline to evaluate adjustment layers in
  the ordered stack (CPU-first, tiling-aware, and cacheable).
- `qpane/catalog/`: allow entries to store adjustment layers alongside image layers
  so adjustments travel with catalog navigation.
- `qpane/layers/` (or `qpane/masks/` until layers land): define a Layer interface
  that supports parameterized transforms and visibility/opacity.
- `qpane/concurrency/`: offload adjustment evaluation and caching to the executor
  to keep the UI thread responsive.
- Trinity updates: evolve `qpane.pyi`, `qpane.py`, `docs/`, and `examples/`
  together for any new adjustment APIs and tutorialized demos.

Key behaviors to define
- Adjustment evaluation order, stacking semantics, and blend rules.
- Cache invalidation strategy when adjustment parameters change.
- Viewer-only mode remains unaffected when no adjustments are present.

Testing focus (when implemented)
- Visual correctness across zoom levels and pyramid resolutions.
- Performance under repeated parameter tweaks (debounced updates).
- Consistent output across platforms and DPI configurations.

## Advanced Editing Tools (Layer-Backed)

Goal: deliver pro-style editing workflows (cut/paste/move, transform, clone/stamp)
powered by the Layer abstraction while keeping the core viewer experience unchanged.

Possible integration points
- `qpane/tools/` + `qpane/input/`: add opt-in tools with clear activation modes and
  host-configurable shortcuts that do not override viewer defaults.
- `qpane/layers/` (or `qpane/masks/` until layers land): represent editable regions
  as layer content so edits remain non-destructive and reversible.
- `qpane/rendering/` + `qpane/swap/`: ensure edited layers are composited and
  cached without changing baseline image viewing performance.
- Trinity updates: evolve `qpane.pyi`, `qpane.py`, `docs/`, and `examples/`
  together for any new editing APIs and tutorialized demos.

Key behaviors to define
- Editing tools are feature-gated and safe to leave disabled.
- Clone/stamp respects zoom, pan, and pixel alignment across DPI changes.
- Cut/paste and move operate on layer content without mutating base image pixels.

Testing focus (when implemented)
- Editing tools do not regress pan/zoom/navigation in viewer-only mode.
- Layer edits are undoable and stable across catalog navigation.
