# Interaction Modes

Modes define the relationship between the pointer and the image. Whether you are building a read-only viewer, a mask editor, or an inpainting workflow, the Control Mode determines what happens when a user clicks, drags, or scrolls.

## Switching Modes
Use `QPane.setControlMode` to switch tools. You can check which mode is active with `QPane.getControlMode` or see the full list of registered tools via `QPane.availableControlModes`.

```python
from qpane import QPane

# Switch to Pan/Zoom (default navigation)
viewer.setControlMode(QPane.CONTROL_MODE_PANZOOM)

# Switch to a static cursor (good for read-only states)
viewer.setControlMode(QPane.CONTROL_MODE_CURSOR)
```

> **Heads-up:** `QPane.setControlMode` will ignore requests for mask or selection modes if the catalog is empty (check `QPane.placeholderActive()` to see if the placeholder is currently shown).

### Building a Toggle
QPane doesn't cycle modes automatically, but you can easily build a toggle button.

```python
# Cycle through available modes
modes = viewer.availableControlModes()
current = viewer.getControlMode()

if modes:
    # Find current index and step forward
    next_index = (modes.index(current) + 1) % len(modes)
    viewer.setControlMode(modes[next_index])
```

## Built-in Modes
QPane comes with core navigation modes ready to use. You can refer to them via the `ControlMode` enum or the string constants on `QPane`.

*   **Pan/Zoom (`ControlMode.PANZOOM`):** The default. Users drag to pan and scroll to zoom. Double-clicking toggles between "fit" and "1:1" views. Wheel steps snap to 100% when crossing it, so you never skip the native scale. Use this for standard navigation.
*   **Cursor (`ControlMode.CURSOR`):** "Look but don't touch." The viewport stays locked, and drag/scroll events are ignored. This is perfect for kiosks or when you want to handle mouse events yourself without the image moving.

If you have installed the `mask` or `sam` extras, you will also see `ControlMode.DRAW_BRUSH` and `ControlMode.SMART_SELECT`. These modes are unavailable when the catalog is empty. See [Masks and SAM](masks-and-sam.md) for details.

## View State
You can control how the image fits into the viewport using `ZoomMode`.
*   `ZoomMode.FIT`: Always keep the whole image visible.
*   `ZoomMode.LOCKED_ZOOM`: Keep pixels 1:1 (great for inspection).
*   `ZoomMode.LOCKED_SIZE`: Keep the viewport size constant.

Want to know how deep you are? `QPane.currentZoom` tells you the current multiplier.

## Interaction Rules
*   **Persistence:** Modes stick around. If you switch to "Brush" mode and navigate to the next image, you remain in "Brush" mode.
*   **Overlays:** Switching modes often changes the cursor and may show or hide overlays (like the brush circle).
*   **Validation:** `setControlMode` safely handles missing features (like trying to use Smart Select without SAM installed) by logging a warning and ignoring the request. However, it raises a `ValueError` if passed an unknown mode ID.
*   **Event Delivery:** Tools always expose the full Qt event surface via concrete no-op handlers, so dispatch is direct and predictable—override only what you need.

> **Pro Tip:** Want the best of both worlds? QPane includes a built-in "hold Space to pan" feature that temporarily switches to `CONTROL_MODE_PANZOOM` while the widget has focus. For a global implementation that works even when focus is elsewhere (like in the demo), see `examples/demonstration/demo_window.py`.
