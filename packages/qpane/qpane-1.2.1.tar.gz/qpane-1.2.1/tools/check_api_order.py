# Code Organization Guide

This repository follows a consistent layout to keep modules readable and predictable. Use the ordering below when adding or refactoring classes, modules, or scripts.

- **Module preamble**: Start with a concise module docstring, then imports grouped as stdlib -> third-party -> local. Keep TYPE_CHECKING imports isolated and initialize the module logger (e.g., `logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)`).
- **Public surface first**: Place public constants, enums, signals/events, and simple static helpers near the top so callers see the API before the internals.
- **Facade/proxy accessors**: Group thin accessors that expose key collaborators (view/presenter/catalog equivalents, managers, registries) together so ownership boundaries stay clear and pre-init guards live in one place.
- **Construction and wiring**: Cluster the constructor and core setup helpers next. Build foundational collaborators first, then optional/feature-specific wiring. Keep normalization/default-selection helpers adjacent to where they are used.
- **Configuration and diagnostics**: Follow setup with configuration applicators, diagnostics collectors, and status/overlay creation helpers. These functions should reapply config and refresh dependent services.
- **Registration/attachment utilities**: Keep registration and attach/detach helpers together (tools, overlays, cursors, services, autosave, etc.). These should be slim pass-throughs that preserve single ownership of state.
- **Domain-focused operations**: Organize feature logic in cohesive blocks (e.g., catalog-like operations, mask-like workflows, viewport/navigation helpers). Within each block, prefer the sequence: read/query helpers -> mutating operations -> async/prefetch helpers.
- **State persistence and view adjustments**: Place pan/zoom or analogous state persistence helpers near the operations that rely on them to keep flow obvious.
- **Rendering/processing entry points**: Keep core "apply/set" entry points (like setting content, allocating buffers, or marking dirty regions) grouped and close to related helpers.
- **Geometry/utility helpers**: Follow with geometry/coordinate conversions or other utility helpers that support rendering or interaction.
- **Event handlers last**: Finish with UI/event plumbing (paint, resize, wheel/mouse/key/enter/leave/show handlers). Handlers should delegate to the interaction layer/delegates rather than owning logic directly.

General style notes:

- Favor expressive names and focused functions so the code explains itself; inline comments should only clarify non-obvious behaviour.
- Keep docstrings concise and in present tense; add Args/Returns/Raises only when signatures are not self-evident.
- Route interactive state through the appropriate delegate/interaction layer; obtain rendering/caching/catalog collaborators via their exposed facades rather than directly reaching into private attributes.
- Group related helpers tightly and avoid scattering lifecycle hooks across the file. If you add a new domain block, keep its accessors, mutators, and lifecycle utilities together.
