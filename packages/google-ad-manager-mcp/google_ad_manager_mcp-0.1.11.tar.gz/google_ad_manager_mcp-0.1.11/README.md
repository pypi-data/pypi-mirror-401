## Why This Exists

Managing Google Ad Manager is tedious. Creating campaigns, uploading creatives, and configuring line items involves countless clicks through a complex UI.

**This MCP server changes that.** Connect it to Claude and manage your entire ad operations through conversation:

- *"Create a new campaign for Nike ending December 31st"*
- *"Upload all creatives from this folder and associate them with the Display line item"*
- *"Check which orders are currently delivering"*

No more clicking. Just tell Claude what you need.

## Features

- **Order Management**: List, create, and manage orders
- **Line Item Management**: Create, duplicate, and configure line items
- **Creative Management**: Upload images, associate with line items, bulk upload
- **Advertiser Management**: Find, create, and list advertisers
- **Verification Tools**: Verify line item setup, check delivery status
- **Campaign Workflow**: Complete campaign creation in one operation

## Installation

### From PyPI (Recommended)

```bash
pip install google-ad-manager-mcp
```

Or with uv:

```bash
uv pip install google-ad-manager-mcp
```

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MatiousCorp/google-ad-manager-mcp.git
cd google-ad-manager-mcp
pip install -e .
```

### Dependencies

- **[FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp)**: MCP server framework with native middleware support
- **[googleads](https://github.com/googleads/googleads-python-lib)**: Google Ad Manager SOAP API client

## Configuration

The server uses environment variables for configuration:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GAM_CREDENTIALS_PATH` | Path to service account JSON | **Yes** |
| `GAM_NETWORK_CODE` | Ad Manager network code | **Yes** |
| `GAM_MCP_TRANSPORT` | Transport mode: `stdio` or `http` | No (default: `stdio`) |
| `GAM_MCP_HOST` | Server host (HTTP mode only) | No (default: `0.0.0.0`) |
| `GAM_MCP_PORT` | Server port (HTTP mode only) | No (default: `8000`) |
| `GAM_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Authentication token (HTTP mode only) | No (auto-generated if not set) |

## Authentication

The server implements Bearer token authentication using [FastMCP native middleware](https://gofastmcp.com/python-sdk/fastmcp-server-auth-auth), following [MCP security best practices](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/draft/basic/security_best_practices).

### Security Features

- **FastMCP Native Middleware**: Uses FastMCP 2.x middleware for proper MCP lifecycle management
- **Cryptographically secure tokens**: Generated using `secrets.token_hex(32)`
- **Timing attack prevention**: Uses constant-time comparison (`hmac.compare_digest`)
- **Tool-level authentication**: Auth validated on every tool call
- **Audit logging**: All authentication failures logged

### How It Works

Authentication is enforced at the tool level using FastMCP's middleware system:
- When a tool is called, the middleware validates the `Authorization` header
- If no token is configured (`GAM_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` not set), requests are allowed
- Invalid or missing tokens return a `ToolError` with a helpful message

### Setup

For remote deployments, set a fixed authentication token:

```bash
# Generate a secure token
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"

# Set it as environment variable
export GAM_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN="your-generated-token"
```

If not set, a random token is generated at startup and displayed in the logs.

Clients must include the token in the Authorization header:
```
Authorization: Bearer your-generated-token
```

### Endpoints

| Endpoint | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `/mcp` | MCP protocol endpoint (auth validated on tool calls) |

## Running the Server

### Local Development

```bash
# Using the installed command
gam-mcp

# Or directly with Python
python -m gam_mcp.server

# With custom configuration
GAM_NETWORK_CODE=12345678 GAM_MCP_PORT=9000 gam-mcp
```

### Docker Deployment

The Docker image runs as a non-root user (`appuser`) for security.

#### Build the Image

```bash
docker build -t google-ad-manager-mcp .
```

#### Run the Container

```bash
# Basic usage with credentials mounted
docker run -d \
  --name gam-mcp \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /path/to/your/credentials.json:/app/credentials.json:ro \
  -e GAM_NETWORK_CODE=YOUR_NETWORK_CODE \
  google-ad-manager-mcp

# With authentication token (recommended for production)
docker run -d \
  --name gam-mcp \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /path/to/your/credentials.json:/app/credentials.json:ro \
  -e GAM_NETWORK_CODE=YOUR_NETWORK_CODE \
  -e GAM_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=$(python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))") \
  google-ad-manager-mcp

# With custom port
docker run -d \
  --name gam-mcp \
  -p 9000:8000 \
  -v /path/to/your/credentials.json:/app/credentials.json:ro \
  -e GAM_NETWORK_CODE=YOUR_NETWORK_CODE \
  -e GAM_MCP_PORT=8000 \
  google-ad-manager-mcp
```

#### View Logs

```bash
# View startup logs (includes generated auth token if not set)
docker logs gam-mcp

# Follow logs
docker logs -f gam-mcp
```

#### Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  gam-mcp:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8000:8000"
    volumes:
      - ./credentials.json:/app/credentials.json:ro
    environment:
      - GAM_NETWORK_CODE=YOUR_NETWORK_CODE
      - GAM_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN=your-secure-token
    restart: unless-stopped
```

Run with:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

#### Verify the Container

```bash
# Check container is running
docker ps

# Test the endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/mcp \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Accept: application/json, text/event-stream" \
  -d '{"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize", "params": {"protocolVersion": "2024-11-05", "capabilities": {}, "clientInfo": {"name": "test", "version": "1.0"}}, "id": 1}'
```

### Cloud Deployment (Railway, Fly.io, etc.)

1. Set environment variables in your cloud provider:
   - `GAM_CREDENTIALS_PATH`: Path to credentials (or use secrets)
   - `GAM_NETWORK_CODE`: Your Ad Manager network code
   - `GAM_MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`: A secure authentication token

2. Deploy using the included Dockerfile
