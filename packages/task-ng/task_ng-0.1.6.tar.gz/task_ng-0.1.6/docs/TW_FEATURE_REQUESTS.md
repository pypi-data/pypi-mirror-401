# Most requested Taskwarrior features from the community

**Taskwarrior users most frequently request subtasks/task hierarchy support, improved recurring task functionality, and better mobile access**—demands that reflect the tension between the tool's command-line power and modern multi-device workflows. These feature requests appear primarily on GitHub Issues (the official channel) and GitHub Discussions, with active parallel conversations on Reddit, Hacker News, and Discord. The v3.0 release in March 2024 intensified requests around sync functionality after the removal of self-hosted taskserver support created significant community pushback.

The pattern is clear: users love Taskwarrior's CLI efficiency and data control but struggle with accessibility gaps that prevent full adoption. Mobile apps remain immature despite multiple community attempts, recurring tasks are powerful but confusing, and the lack of native notifications means the tool can't proactively alert users. These limitations force users into workarounds or prevent them from fully committing to Taskwarrior despite appreciating its core strengths.

## Subtasks emerge as the dominant feature request

**Nested task support represents the most requested feature across all platforms**, with Issue #3765 opened in January 2025 gaining immediate traction and multiple community members expressing support. Users want true hierarchical task structures beyond the current project system—the ability to break down tasks into sub-tasks that can themselves contain further sub-tasks. The existence of at least three separate third-party implementations (subtaskwarrior, taskwarrior-subtask-capsule, tw-subtask-sh) demonstrates both the demand intensity and the community's willingness to build workarounds when official features don't exist.

Currently, users attempt to simulate subtasks using dependencies, but this approach proves cumbersome and conceptually incorrect. One Stack Overflow user highlighted the friction: "Is there a way to add a task and specify that other tasks depend on this one in one line? I add these subtasks over time, so it ends up being two lines every time." **The dependency system creates task-to-task relationships rather than parent-child hierarchies**, missing the semantic meaning users need for breaking down complex work. A related request (#246 from 2010, still open) asks for partial completion indicators, further highlighting the desire to track progress on composite tasks.

The subtasks discussion connects to broader requests for better dependency visualization. Users want to see dependency trees and understand which tasks are blocking others, features that would make project management workflows more intuitive. Discussion #3882 from May 2025 specifically requested a "blocks" attribute (the reverse of depends) to make these relationships more transparent from both directions.

## Recurring tasks generate the most numerous and varied complaints

**Recurrence functionality receives the highest volume of distinct feature requests**, with at least five separate GitHub issues addressing different aspects of the recurring task system. This proliferation of related issues indicates a core feature that works but causes significant user friction through complexity and missing capabilities. One Hacker News commenter captured the frustration: "The recurrence system is listed as an 'advanced topic'... I gave up on trying to make heads or tails of recurrence... having way too many times where I had meant to make a change to just a particular single task, and then having unexpected changes."

Issue #1346, opened in May 2014 and still unresolved, requests "recurring tasks - repeat 'after completion'" functionality. Users need tasks that reschedule based on completion date rather than fixed calendar intervals—mowing the lawn every 14 days from when it was last mowed, not every other Tuesday regardless of when the work happened. This feature exists in competing tools like RememberTheMilk but remains absent from Taskwarrior despite consistent community demand spanning more than a decade. Professional users like lawyers tracking recurring court deadlines and maintenance workers scheduling equipment servicing particularly need this capability.

Issue #1983 requests recurrence end conditions, allowing users to specify "after X occurrences" or "on specific date" similar to Google Calendar's implementation. Academic users cite MOOC courses and semester-based tasks as use cases where recurring tasks should automatically terminate. Issue #1741 asks for advanced recurrence patterns supporting "third Thursday of month" or "last Saturday" with proposed syntax like `recur:thirdthursday` or `recur:2ndfri-7d`. **The volume and specificity of recurrence requests suggest the current implementation handles basic cases but fails for the nuanced scheduling patterns real users encounter**.

Technical issues compound the conceptual limitations. Issue #97 reports that recurring tasks don't honor due times and reset to midnight. Issue #1649 documents problems with multiple duplicate instances appearing. The mask system that controls recurring task visibility confuses users and generates errors. Perhaps most tellingly, the "recurring overhaul" promised for v3.0 was never delivered, leaving these pain points unaddressed in the major 2024 release.

## Mobile access represents the accessibility gap

**Mobile apps remain the most frequently cited missing feature when users compare Taskwarrior to mainstream alternatives like Todoist**, appearing in every research channel from GitHub to blog posts to review sites. One user summarized it bluntly: "The lack of a friendly mobile app would be a dealbreaker for using this for personal tasks." Google Summer of Code projects from 2022-2025 have focused on developing a Flutter-based mobile app for all platforms and an iOS home widget, indicating the community and developers recognize this gap, but as of early 2025 no mature, widely-adopted solution exists.

The mobile challenge extends beyond just lacking apps—existing mobile solutions struggle with sync setup complexity and feature limitations. Multiple third-party mobile projects (Foreground, TaskwarriorC2, taskwarrior-flutter) exist but none achieved mainstream adoption. Foreground was discontinued when v3.0's breaking changes to sync architecture made it incompatible. A Google Play review captured the setup frustration: "Main reason for the 4 stars is the unclear description for the need of a server running."

**Users explicitly contrast Taskwarrior's command-line focus with their real-world need for on-the-go task capture**—adding shopping list items while at the store, recording tasks during commutes, checking off items without opening a laptop. One tech lead noted he reserves Taskwarrior for work tasks specifically because "The extremely minimal nature of Taskwarrior means that it's also not cloud-integrated... This may be a downside to those who want access to their list of tasks from their many different devices." The tool's strength as a power-user CLI becomes a limitation when users can't access their tasks on the devices they actually carry throughout the day.

Beyond mobile apps, users request native GUI interfaces and modern web UIs. Multiple third-party web interfaces exist (taskwarrior-web, taskwarrior-webui, VIT) but remain fragmented with no official solution. Users with ADHD or visual learning preferences particularly need graphical task representation. One Hacker News user explained: "Task warrior is the my core of task management, as I've ADHD, I lost track of my task if it's not easily visible, this ui helps me with that. It shows timer for active task on the top." Kanban board views and visual dependency trees appear frequently in feature discussions.

## Sync functionality became a crisis point with v3.0

**The March 2024 release of Taskwarrior 3.0 transformed sync from a general pain point to an acute crisis** that generated the highest-engagement GitHub Discussion (#3291 with 12 comments and 38 replies). The removal of taskserver/taskd support and migration to TaskChampion's cloud-storage backends eliminated users' existing self-hosted sync workflows. One user captured the community sentiment: "It's a sad day for me when the recommended solution requires storing my task data on google cloud (and it has to be google cloud as it's the only one supported)."

The architectural change from plain text files to SQLite databases exacerbated sync concerns by eliminating Git-based synchronization workflows that many power users relied upon. A community member emphasized this loss: "I really would like that TW3 can use plain text files instead of binary data... plain text files was, by far, the most important point for using taskwarrior." Users valued the transparency of plain text—the ability to manually edit task files, version control with Git, and simple backup strategies. **The SQLite migration prioritized performance and data integrity but sacrificed the accessibility and simplicity that attracted users to Taskwarrior initially**.

Self-hosting advocates felt particularly alienated by the cloud-first approach. While taskchampion-sync-server theoretically provides a self-hosted option, users report it's "even more bare-bones than taskserver" with minimal documentation. A developer acknowledged in Discussion #3299: "I suspect you're not alone in wanting to deploy a self-hosted sync backend. We don't have a great answer for that right now." The combination of breaking changes, forced migration paths, and unclear documentation created significant adoption barriers for v3.0, with some Arch Linux users reporting empty task databases after surprise upgrades.

LWN.net comments revealed broader concerns about development direction: "This (sudden?) turn in direction actually sort of astonished me. I always assumed that the developers of Taskwarrior were aware of its power-user-first audience." The sync controversy highlights a fundamental tension between modernizing the technical architecture and maintaining the values that attracted the existing community—data ownership, self-hosting capabilities, and transparent data formats.

## Notifications and reminders expose architectural limitations

**Time-based notifications represent a frequently requested feature that conflicts with Taskwarrior's design philosophy as an on-demand command-line tool**. The official FAQ explicitly addresses this: "Taskwarrior currently doesn't support the pomodoro technique, not because it doesn't have all the necessary features, but because it has no way to notify the user if a given point in time has arrived. Remember: most of the time, Taskwarrior isn't running." Users accustomed to mobile apps and desktop tools expect proactive reminders when tasks become due, but Taskwarrior's architecture requires users to actively query their tasks rather than having the system push information.

This architectural constraint forces users into creative workarounds. Some implement cron jobs with custom email scripts (taskmailer), others use tmux status bars to display upcoming tasks, and some integrate with external notification tools through hook scripts. **The existence of these workarounds demonstrates both the demand for notifications and the friction users accept to stay within the Taskwarrior ecosystem**. Professional users like the lawyer who documented his Todoist migration specifically cited notification absence as a limitation for deadline-driven work.

The notification gap connects to broader requests for Pomodoro timer integration and time tracking. Multiple third-party Pomodoro tools (taskwarrior-pomodoro, pomodoroTasks2, pomodoro-warriors) exist because core integration isn't feasible. Taskwarrior's companion tool Timewarrior handles time tracking separately, but users want tighter integration between task management and time measurement. These requests reveal user expectations shaped by integrated productivity apps where tasks, timers, and notifications exist within a unified experience.

## Collaboration features remain aspirational despite growing demand

**Multi-user functionality generated multiple feature requests and discussions despite developers acknowledging it as a long-term aspiration without current support**. Issue #2195 from July 2019 requested collaboration features, though it was later closed as "eval:incomplete." Discussion #2591 explored multi-user taskwarrior usage, with a developer responding: "This is indeed one of our aspirational long-term goals, however, the current state of the tool does not support any specific multi-user features."

Users want task assignment, ownership tracking, shared project boards, and task locking to prevent editing conflicts. Teams attempting to use Taskwarrior resort to git-based workflows with custom attributes to simulate ownership, but these approaches lack proper conflict resolution and task handoff mechanisms. **The absence of collaboration features limits Taskwarrior to individual productivity rather than team coordination**, despite many users working in environments where task management must be collaborative. The project TaskArena attempted to provide team features but was mentioned as broken in community discussions.

Professional users particularly feel this limitation. Project managers need to delegate tasks, track team progress, and visualize shared priorities. The kanban board visualization requests often connect to team contexts where multiple users need shared views of work status. While Taskwarrior excels for individual GTD workflows, its architecture wasn't designed for the shared databases, access controls, and notification systems that multi-user environments require.

## Where feature discussions concentrate across platforms

**GitHub Issues serves as the primary channel for formal feature requests**, with the GothenburgBitFactory/taskwarrior repository (5.3k stars) hosting issues labeled as "type:enhancement." Users vote on features through GitHub reactions (thumbs up), with issues receiving 4+ reactions considered high engagement. The "topic:recurrence" label contains numerous related enhancement requests, reflecting that problem domain's complexity. GitHub's issue tracker provides the most direct path to developer attention and potential implementation.

**GitHub Discussions (#ideas category) emerged as the preferred venue for pre-proposal feature exploration**, where users discuss concepts before filing formal issues. The official taskwarrior.org/docs/features/ page explicitly guides users to discuss features first rather than submitting patches, emphasizing the importance of community deliberation before implementation. Recent high-engagement discussions include #3977 (subtasks proposal, October 2025), #3291 (v3.0 release feedback, 38 replies), and #2591 (multi-user usage). This two-tier system separates brainstorming from formal feature tracking.

**Discord replaced IRC as the real-time community chat platform**, with the #help-wanted channel serving as the main support and discussion venue. The server link (discord.gg/eRXEHk8w62) is prominently featured on taskwarrior.org/support. **Bi-weekly community meetings occur every other Saturday at 1600 UTC via Google Meet**, with archives posted to a YouTube playlist. Recent meetings from January through March 2025 indicate active community coordination and likely serve as venues for discussing feature priorities though meeting notes weren't publicly accessible through web search.

Reddit discussions occur primarily on r/taskwarrior along with r/productivity and r/commandline, though engagement levels appear lower than GitHub. Reddit serves more for user workflow discussions and troubleshooting than formal feature proposals. Hacker News discussions (like item 41372482 from August 2024) generate bursts of engagement when Taskwarrior surfaces in broader tech community conversations, often highlighting gaps when users compare their experiences with alternative tools. Stack Overflow contains numerous questions about workarounds for missing features, revealing practical user needs that formal channels might miss.

Google Groups mailing lists (taskwarrior-user and taskwarrior-dev) remain available but show lower activity levels compared to GitHub-based communication. The historical IRC channel (#taskwarrior on freenode) is rarely mentioned in recent discussions. **The consolidation around GitHub Discussions and Discord represents a modern shift in open source community organization**, making feature requests more discoverable and discussion more accessible than the distributed mailing list era.

## Patterns revealing user needs and development constraints

**Every major feature request cluster reflects the same underlying tension: users want Taskwarrior's command-line power extended to mobile/GUI contexts without sacrificing the attributes that make the CLI valuable**. The subtasks, recurrence improvements, mobile apps, and visual interfaces all attempt to bridge this gap. Users don't want Taskwarrior to become Todoist—they want Taskwarrior's flexibility and data control accessible through interfaces beyond the terminal. One user articulated this precisely: "We don't want a lot of bloat... we want the original taskwarrior to have a GUI that works on all devices."

**Development resource constraints shape which requests receive attention**. Discussion #3208 from the lead developer revealed: "I've run out of steam on this project after a few years' work." The v3.0 release consumed enormous effort for TaskChampion integration and database migration, leaving promised features like the recurring task overhaul undelivered. Limited maintainer bandwidth means features must be prioritized ruthlessly, and highly requested features like subtasks remain unimplemented years after initial requests. **The vibrant third-party ecosystem (mobile apps, web UIs, subtask tools) exists partly because core development can't address all user needs**.

**The plain text versus binary database controversy epitomizes philosophical conflicts within the community**. Power users valued transparency, Git workflows, and manual editability that plain text enabled. The SQLite migration in v3.0 improved performance, data integrity, and enabled features like better locking, but alienated users for whom data accessibility was paramount. Similar tensions appear in sync discussions (self-hosting versus cloud) and interface debates (CLI purity versus GUI accessibility). These aren't technical disagreements but fundamental differences in how users conceptualize task management tools.

**Feature requests concentrate in three categories: reducing friction for existing workflows, enabling multi-device access, and extending capabilities toward project management**. Recurrence improvements and better error messages reduce friction. Mobile apps and sync improvements enable multi-device access. Subtasks, dependencies, and collaboration features extend toward project management. This pattern suggests Taskwarrior occupies an awkward middle ground—more powerful than simple to-do apps but less comprehensive than project management platforms—with users pulling it in both directions based on their individual needs.

## Recent requests with the highest community momentum

**Issue #3765 requesting subtasks (January 26, 2025) represents the most recent high-priority feature request** with immediate community reactions and acknowledgment as "type:enhancement." The issue author provided clear use cases and implementation suggestions, and commenters quickly referenced existing third-party solutions, indicating both demand intensity and the community's familiarity with this long-standing gap. The subtasks discussion also connects to October 2025's Discussion #3977 proposing a formal subtasks specification.

**Discussion #3291 about the v3.0 release (March 2024) generated the highest engagement levels** with 12 top-level comments and 38 replies—exceptional for Taskwarrior community discussions. The thread captured real-time reactions to breaking changes, sync architecture concerns, and data migration issues. **The conversation revealed not just technical problems but community trust issues around communication and development direction**. Users felt blindsided by the forced migration from taskserver to cloud-based sync, raising questions about whether developers understood their user base's priorities.

Issue #2398 requesting tag specification improvements to allow dashes (January 2021) and Issue #2145 requesting better error messages (April 2019) show long-standing enhancement requests that remain open, indicating either low developer priority or technical complexity blocking implementation. Both issues carry "type:enhancement" labels and represent quality-of-life improvements rather than major features. **The accumulation of small enhancement requests over years suggests difficulty gaining mindshare for incremental improvements when major architectural changes like v3.0 consume development capacity**.

Performance concerns with Taskwarrior 3.x appeared in Discussion #3993 (November 2024+), indicating that the SQLite migration created new problems even as it solved others. Users reported slower operations compared to v2.x's plain text implementation, adding another dimension to the controversial v3.0 transition. Context and filtering improvements appeared in recent issues #3764 and #3737 from 2024-2025, and autocomplete enhancements in Issue #3756 (January 2025), demonstrating ongoing community engagement with user experience refinements.

## Conclusion: power meets practicality

The Taskwarrior feature request landscape reveals a tool at a crossroads between its command-line heritage and users' multi-device reality. Subtasks, improved recurrence, mobile access, and better sync represent not peripheral desires but fundamental gaps preventing broader adoption. The vibrant third-party ecosystem—with multiple mobile apps, web interfaces, and workflow tools—demonstrates both the community's commitment and the core project's inability to serve all user needs directly.

Version 3.0's controversial reception highlights how architectural modernization can alienate existing users when it conflicts with core values like data transparency and self-hosting. The most engaged discussions focused not on new capabilities but on preserving existing workflows after breaking changes. This pattern suggests the community prioritizes stability and predictability over rapid feature development, even while requesting numerous enhancements.

**Feature requests cluster around three themes: making powerful features more accessible, enabling modern workflows across devices, and reducing friction in daily use**. Users don't want Taskwarrior to abandon its CLI efficiency—they want that efficiency extended to contexts where opening a terminal isn't practical. The fact that recurring task improvements generate the most distinct issues while subtasks generate the most recent momentum indicates both long-standing pain points and evolving priorities as users' work environments change. Development resource constraints mean many requested features will likely remain community-provided rather than officially integrated, making the third-party ecosystem essential to Taskwarrior's continued relevance.
