# Test GEO Dataset for Validation

## Content

This is a test GEO dataset for validating the GEOSource implementation. The dataset contains gene expression profiles from human samples. Airway epithelial cells were collected from asthma patients and healthy controls. Differential expression analysis identified genes involved in inflammatory response pathways. The study provides insights into molecular mechanisms of airway inflammation in asthma.
