Gene Z expression patterns vary significantly across different tissue types and developmental stages. Our comprehensive transcriptomic analysis revealed that gene Z is highly expressed in neural tissues during embryonic development, with peak expression occurring during neural tube formation. In adult tissues, gene Z shows moderate expression in the brain, particularly in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex. We also identified several tissue-specific splice variants of gene Z, suggesting complex post-transcriptional regulation. Functional studies demonstrated that gene Z is required for neuronal differentiation and synaptic plasticity. Loss of gene Z function results in severe neurological defects, highlighting its critical role in nervous system development and function.
