Protein Y inhibits apoptosis through direct interaction with caspase-3. This study reveals the molecular mechanism by which Protein Y prevents programmed cell death in cancer cells. We performed extensive biochemical analyses showing that Protein Y binds to the active site of caspase-3 with high affinity, thereby blocking the proteolytic cascade that leads to apoptosis. Additionally, we observed that overexpression of Protein Y correlates with poor prognosis in several cancer types. These findings suggest that targeting the Protein Y-caspase-3 interaction could be a promising therapeutic strategy for treating resistant cancers.
