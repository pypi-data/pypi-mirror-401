## Content

TP53 is the most frequently mutated gene in human cancers, with mutations found in over 50% of all tumors. The TP53 gene encodes the p53 protein, often called the "guardian of the genome" due to its critical role in preventing cancer development.

p53 functions as a transcription factor that regulates the expression of genes involved in cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair, and senescence. In response to cellular stress, p53 is stabilized and activated, leading to the transcription of target genes.

Missense mutations in TP53 are the most common type observed in cancers. These mutations typically occur in the DNA-binding domain and result in loss of p53 tumor suppressor function. Some TP53 mutations confer gain-of-function properties that actively promote oncogenesis.

The Li-Fraumeni syndrome is a hereditary cancer predisposition disorder caused by germline TP53 mutations. Individuals with Li-Fraumeni syndrome have significantly increased risk of developing multiple cancer types at early ages.

Therapeutic strategies targeting mutant p53 include restoration of wild-type p53 function, depletion of mutant p53 protein, and exploitation of metabolic vulnerabilities in p53-deficient cells. Several compounds are in clinical development for treating TP53-mutant cancers.

In conclusion, TP53 mutations play a central role in cancer pathogenesis. Understanding the molecular consequences of different TP53 mutations is essential for developing effective targeted therapies.
