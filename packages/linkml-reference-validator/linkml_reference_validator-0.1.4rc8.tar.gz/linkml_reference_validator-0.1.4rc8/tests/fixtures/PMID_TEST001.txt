Protein X functions in cell cycle regulation and plays a critical role in DNA repair mechanisms. Our studies demonstrate that this protein is essential for maintaining genomic stability during mitosis. The protein localizes to the nucleus during S phase and interacts with key checkpoint proteins to ensure proper chromosome segregation.
