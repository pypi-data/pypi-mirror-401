# Jupyter Notebooks for linkml-reference-validator

This directory contains interactive Jupyter notebook tutorials demonstrating the functionality of linkml-reference-validator.

## Available Notebooks

- **01_getting_started.ipynb** - Introduction to basic reference validation, including PMC and PMID fetching
- **02_advanced_usage.ipynb** - Advanced features including batch processing and custom configurations

## Running Notebooks Locally

### Interactive Development
To start Jupyter Lab and work with notebooks interactively:

```bash
just jupyter
```

This will open Jupyter Lab in your browser with the notebooks directory.

### Testing Notebooks
To verify all notebooks execute without errors:

```bash
just run-notebooks
```

To test a specific notebook:

```bash
just run-notebook 01_getting_started.ipynb
```

### Rendering for Documentation
To execute notebooks and render them as HTML for the documentation site:

```bash
just render-notebooks
```

This will:
1. Execute each notebook with papermill
2. Convert executed notebooks to HTML with nbconvert
3. Place HTML files in `docs/notebooks/` for mkdocs to serve

## Workflow

**Source notebooks** (tracked in git):
- Location: `notebooks/*.ipynb`
- These are the editable source files

**Executed notebooks** (git-ignored):
- Location: `notebooks/output/*.ipynb`
- Generated by papermill during testing/rendering

**Rendered HTML** (git-ignored):
- Location: `docs/notebooks/*.html`
- Generated by nbconvert for documentation
- Served by mkdocs at `/notebooks/` URLs

## Development Guidelines

- Keep notebooks self-contained and executable from top to bottom
- Use `tempfile` for any temporary files needed during execution
- Suppress warnings during execution using environment variables when appropriate
- Include clear markdown explanations between code cells
- Test notebooks regularly with `just run-notebooks`
