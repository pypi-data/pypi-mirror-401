# AIS to TAK Gateway - Maritime Domain Awareness for Public Safety & Defense

AISCOT provides critical maritime domain awareness by streaming real-time vessel tracking data directly into Team Awareness Kit (TAK) platforms. This solution enables public safety professionals to monitor maritime activities with comprehensive situational awareness through native TAK integration.

## Key Capabilities

- **Real-time Maritime Tracking**: Continuous AIS data capture and reporting for immediate threat assessment
- **Native TAK Integration**: Seamless compatibility with ATAK, WinTAK, iTAK, TAK Server & TAKX using Cursor on Target (CoT) protocols
- **Multi-source Data Fusion**: Support for RF AIS transmissions, local NMEA feeds, and Internet-based AIS aggregators
- **Comprehensive Vessel Intelligence**: Display vessel icons, attitude, type, track history, bearing, speed, callsign, and maritime identifiers
- **Government Data Access**: Integration with [US Department of Transportation SeaVision](https://seavision.volpe.dot.gov/) for enhanced coverage

## Use Cases

- **Port Security**: Monitor vessel approaches and harbor activities
- **Border Protection**: Track maritime border crossings and suspicious activities  
- **Search & Rescue**: Coordinate response efforts with real-time vessel positions
- **Intelligence Operations**: Analyze maritime patterns and vessel behaviors
