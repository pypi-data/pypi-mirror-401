# Tutorial

Four-part walkthrough from writing device drivers to coordinating multiple tools. Assumes basic familiarity with Python classes. 15–20 minutes to work through all four parts.

Structure:

- [Part 1: Basic Device Control](part1_devices.md): Write a device driver and control an instrument
- [Part 2: Background Tasks](part2_tasks.md): Run long experiments without blocking, handle cancellation
- [Part 3: Real-Time Streaming](part3_streaming.md): Stream live data from instruments
- [Part 4: Adding a Server](part4_add_a_server.md): Let multiple tools (scripts, GUIs, dashboards) work with the same devices simultaneously

- [Cheat Sheet](../cheat_sheet.md) — Quick code reference
- [Core API](../core_api.md) — Complete Python API documentation
