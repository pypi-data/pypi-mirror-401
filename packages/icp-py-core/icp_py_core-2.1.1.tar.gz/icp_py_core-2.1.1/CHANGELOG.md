### Technical Details

- Rust extension implementation with `serde` for JSON serialization
- Custom `JsonType` enum matching Python expected format

- Net change: +1212 lines (41 files changed, +5951 added, -4739 deleted)

## [2.0.0] - 2025-12-01

### Breaking Changes

- **Certificate verification is now enabled by default for all query calls.**  
  - This improves security by ensuring responses are properly certified.  
  - If you need the previous behavior (verification disabled), you can do:
  
    ```python
    client = IcpClient(..., verify_certification=False)
    ```

### Bug Fixes

- Fixed: Missing flag byte in Principal decoding.
- Fixed: Authenticated query calls failing under certain conditions.

## [1.0.1] - 2025-12-01

### Fixed
- **secp256k1 identity documentation and tests**  
  - Corrected documentation to clarify that secp256k1 uses 64-byte raw signatures (r||s format) with canonical low-S, not DER format.  
  - Fixed test expectation for secp256k1 public key length (128 hex characters for x||y coordinates, no 0x04 prefix).

## [1.0.0] - 2025-10-20

### Security
- **Certificate verification now enabled by default**  
  - `Agent.update_raw()` and `Agent.update_raw_async()` now default to `verify_certificate=True` for maximum security.  
  - Users can still disable verification with `verify_certificate=False` for compatibility or testing purposes.  
  - This change ensures the most secure option is used by default, protecting against unverified responses from boundary nodes.

### Added
- **Certificate verification**  
  - Introduced BLS12-381 certificate verification using the official [`blst`](https://github.com/supranational/blst) Python binding.  
  - New parameter `verify_certificate` in `Agent.update_raw` and `Agent.update_raw_async`.  
  - When `verify_certificate=True`, update calls are verified against the IC's certified responses.  
  - Includes full unit test coverage for verification scenarios.  
  - **Note:** In later versions, certificate verification is enabled by default for security.  

### Changed
- **Endpoint upgrade**  
  - Migrated `update_raw` calls from legacy `/api/v2/.../call` endpoint to new **BN v3 call endpoint** (`/api/v3/canister/.../call`).  
  - Implemented response adaptation and improved retry logic for more stable request handling.  
  - Enhanced the `poll` and `poll_and_wait` methods for correctness and resilience.  

- **Timeouts & error classification**  
  - Added configurable timeout handling in client calls.  
  - Improved error classification for common canister rejection codes, with more structured runtime exceptions.

### Security
- Addresses longstanding gaps in certificate validation:  
  - `update_raw` and `poll` now support certificate verification when enabled.  
  - Protects against unverified responses from boundary nodes.
