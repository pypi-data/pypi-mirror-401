# ic-py Maintenance & Development Roadmap

**Guiding Principles:**
- Fix all known security vulnerabilities in ic-py
- Modernize and complete the Candid type system
- Maintain feature-and-schedule alignment with agent-rs long-term

---

## Milestone 1 ✅ *Completed*

- **Endpoint upgrade**
    - **Issue:** ic-py was pointing at legacy endpoints and needed to switch to v3
    - **References:**
        - [Reducing end-to-end latencies on the Internet Computer](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/reducing-end-to-end-latencies-on-the-internet-computer/34383)
        - [Boundary Node Roadmap (latest v3 endpoints)](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/boundary-node-roadmap/15562/104?u=c-b-elite)
    - **Solution:** Updated ic-py's default endpoints to the latest BN v3 addresses and established maintenance tracking for future roadmap changes

- **Timeouts & error classification**
    - **Issues:** Missing timeouts on agent calls; lack of fine-grained error categories for canister responses (e.g. exhausted cycles, missing WASM)
    - **References:** [#117](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py/issues/117) • [#115](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py/issues/115)
    - **Solution:**
        1. Implemented configurable timeouts on all agent calls
        2. Introduced structured error types for common canister-level failures

---

## Milestone 2 ✅ *Completed*

- **IC certificate verification**
    - **Issue:** `request_status_raw` and `request_status_raw_async` did not verify certificates, allowing a malicious node to tamper with update responses
    - **References:**
        - DFINITY forum: [Unmaintained IC agents containing vulnerabilities](https://forum.dfinity.org/t/unmaintained-ic-agents-containing-vulnerabilities/41589?u=marc0olo)
        - GitHub issue [#109](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py/issues/109)
        - PR [#56](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py/pull/56/files) • issue [#76](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py/issues/76)
    - **Solution:**
        1. Mirrored agent-rs's certificate-checking logic ([agent-rs implementation](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-rs/blob/b53d770cfd07df07b1024cfd9cc25f7ff80d1b76/ic-agent/src/agent/mod.rs#L903))
        2. Resolved Python–BLS compatibility by bridging Rust BLS crate via FFI
        3. ✅ Certificate verification enabled by default in `update_raw` and `update_raw_async` methods
        4. ✅ Certificate verification implemented in `poll` and `poll_async` methods

---

## Milestone 3 ✅ *Completed*

- **Candid type-system enhancements**
    - **Issue:** Missing support for the latest Candid features (e.g. composite queries, new primitives)
    - **References:**
        - [#111](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py/issues/111) • [PR #112](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py/pull/112/files) • [#63](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py/issues/63)
        - [Latest Candid spec](https://github.com/dfinity/candid)
    - **Solution:**
        1. ✅ Migrated from Python ANTLR4 implementation to Rust-based `candid-parser` crate for significant performance improvements (multiple times faster parsing speed)
        2. ✅ Implemented comprehensive DIDLoader interface with support for recursive type definitions and service interface parsing
        3. ✅ Added comprehensive test suite (`test_candid_comprehensive.py`, `test_did_loader_comprehensive.py`, `test_parser.py`)
        4. ✅ Full support for all Candid primitives, composite types (Record, Variant, Vec, Opt), and recursive types
        5. ✅ Automatic retrieval of Candid file directly from canister (via DIDLoader)

## Milestone 4 (Partially Completed)

- **Expanded API surface** ✅ *Partially Completed*
    - ✅ High-level wrappers for ICP Ledger (`ledger.py`)
    - ✅ Complete NNS Governance interface implementation (`governance.py` - 1510 lines)
    - ✅ Cycles Wallet operations (`cycles_wallet.py`)
    - ✅ Canister Management interface (`management.py`)
    - ✅ Comprehensive example code library (ledger, governance, cycles_wallet, management, simple_counter examples)
    - ⏳ High-level wrappers for ICRC-compliant ledgers (ckBTC, ckETH, ckUSDc, etc.)
    - ⏳ Out-of-the-box helpers for interacting with Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other canisters

- **Code optimization** ✅ *Completed*
    - ✅ Simplified `canister.py` from 1322 lines to ~112 lines (90%+ reduction)
    - ✅ Improved code structure and maintainability
    - ✅ Better error handling and dynamic method binding support

- **Dynamic HTTP provider & routing** ⏳ *Pending*
    - Implement latency-based, adaptive routing between boundary nodes
    - Support more flexible selection of endpoints at runtime

- **Ongoing alignment & optimization**
    - Keep pace with agent-rs's feature roadmap
    - Targeted performance tuning, stricter type checks
    - Define additional milestones once Milestones 1–3 are complete

## Milestone 5 (Next Release)

- **Replica-signed queries**
    - **Issue:** Query calls currently do not support replica-signed responses for enhanced security

- **Certificate Verification Security Enhancement in Low-level Functions**
    - **Issue:** The `request_status_raw` and `request_status_raw_async` methods currently return certificates but do not verify them, posing a security risk

- **HTTP Endpoint Update to Latest API**
    - **Issue:** Query and read_state operations are still using v2 endpoints and need to be updated to the latest API version

### Other long-standing bugs

- **Precision of returned data**
    - Issue [#107](https://github.com/rocklabs-io/ic-py/issues/107) – floating-point vs. integer handling
