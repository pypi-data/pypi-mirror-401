- parametrize claude (--dangerously-skip-permissions) etc. when doing `spawn`
- move `.scope` to be global across cwd ? (Debate)
- make it CC agnostic, (aider/codex)
- add notifications (this subagent needs human assistance)
- spawning logic needs a task decomposition step
  - failure mode: the same task keeps getting spawned infinitely. each spawn should decompose the problem into simpler subproblems. divide and conquer.
