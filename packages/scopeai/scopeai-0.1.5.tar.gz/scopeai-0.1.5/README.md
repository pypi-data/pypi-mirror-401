> Scope is a **substrate for building orchestration patterns**, not an orchestrator itself. It provides primitives (`spawn`, `wait`, `poll`) and visibility—you build the intelligence layer.

---

## The Problem

**Your context is rotting.**

Every task you give Claude Code accumulates baggage: file contents, failed attempts, exploratory tangents. When compaction kicks in, critical details vanish. Your main session becomes a diluted mess.

```
Main Session Context Over Time:

Start:    [████████████████████████████████████████] 100% relevant
After 3   [████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 20% relevant
  tasks:  ↑ file reads, dead ends, tangents, old completions

After     [██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] 5% relevant
compaction: ↑ critical details lost in summarization
```

This is **context rot**. Single-session workflows are fundamentally broken.

---

## The Solution

**Spawn purpose-specific subagents with fresh context.**

```
With Scope:

Main:     [████████████████████████████████████████] orchestration + results only
          ↓ spawn
Subagent: [████████████████░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░] does one job, returns summary
          ↑ fresh context, focused task, clean result
```

Each subagent:
- Starts with **fresh context** (no accumulated baggage)
- Has a **single purpose** (no scope creep)
- Returns **only what matters** (you get the result, not the journey)

Your main session coordinates. Subagents execute.

---

## Quick Start (< 5 minutes)

### 1. Install (30 seconds)

```bash
# Install
uv tool install scopeai

# Or run directly without installing
uvx scopeai
```

### 2. Setup (1 minute)

```bash
# Run setup (installs hooks, checks dependencies)
scope setup
```

**What this does:**
- Installs Claude Code hooks to `~/.claude/settings.json`
- Verifies `tmux` is installed
- Adds Scope documentation so Claude Code knows how to use it
- No API keys needed (uses your existing Claude Code auth)

**Verify:** Run `scope` - you should see an empty dashboard.

### 3. First Session (2 minutes)

```bash
# Open the Scope dashboard
scope
```

**In the dashboard:**
1. Press `n` to start a new Claude Code session
2. Give Claude a multi-step task naturally:
   - "Research authentication patterns in this codebase and implement JWT"
   - "Refactor the API to use async/await"
   - "Add comprehensive tests for the user module"

**What happens:**
- Claude analyzes the task and decides if it needs subagents
- For complex tasks, Claude automatically spawns focused subagents (research, implement, test)
- Watch the dashboard update in real-time as subagents start, run, and complete
- Your main session stays lean—just coordination and results

**You don't need to know about `scope spawn` commands.** Just talk to Claude naturally. The dashboard shows what's happening behind the scenes.

> **Advanced:** Want manual control? See the [Orchestration Patterns](#example-orchestration-patterns) section for CLI usage.

### 4. Update (anytime)

```bash
# Update to latest version
scope update

# Or install a specific version
scope update 0.1.3
```

**That's it.** You're now orchestrating subagents with transparent visibility.

---

## Example Orchestration Patterns

Scope is a protocol. Here's how to build common patterns on top:

### Sequential (Chain of Custody)

```bash
# Each task depends on the previous
id1=$(scope spawn "research auth patterns")
scope wait $id1

id2=$(scope spawn "implement auth based on research from session $id1")
scope wait $id2

id3=$(scope spawn "write tests for auth implementation")
scope wait $id3
```

**Pattern:** Linear pipeline. Each step waits for the previous.

---

### Parallel (Fork-Join)

```bash
# Spawn multiple independent tasks
id1=$(scope spawn "audit codebase for security issues")
id2=$(scope spawn "research modern auth patterns")
id3=$(scope spawn "analyze test coverage")

# Wait for all to complete
scope wait $id1 $id2 $id3

# Now synthesize results
echo "All research complete. Aggregating findings..."
```

**Pattern:** Fork multiple subagents, join when all complete.

---

### DAG (Dependency Graph)

```bash
# Declare the full DAG upfront using --id and --after
scope spawn "research auth patterns" --id research
scope spawn "audit current codebase" --id audit
scope spawn "implement auth" --id impl --after research,audit
scope spawn "write tests" --id tests --after impl
scope spawn "update docs" --id docs --after impl

# Wait only on leaf nodes—dependencies auto-resolve
scope wait tests docs
```

**Pattern:** Directed acyclic graph. `--after` encodes dependencies. Scope validates the DAG but doesn't schedule—your shell does.

**How it works:**
- `--after research,audit` means `impl` session receives metadata about what to wait for
- **Your orchestration code** (bash, or the parent Claude session) enforces the wait
- Scope just tracks state—it doesn't run a scheduler

---

### Map-Reduce

```bash
# Map: Spawn N workers
files=$(find src/ -name "*.py")
for file in $files; do
  scope spawn "analyze $file for type errors" --id "worker-$file" &
done

# Reduce: Wait for all, aggregate results
scope wait worker-*
echo "Aggregating type errors from all files..."
cat .scope/sessions/worker-*/result | jq -s 'add'
```

**Pattern:** Spawn many workers, aggregate results.

---

### Recursive Decomposition

Subagents can spawn children. Each child gets a namespaced ID.

```bash
# Inside session 0, this creates 0.0
scope spawn "Extract JWT helpers"

# Inside session 0.0, this creates 0.0.0
scope spawn "Parse token format"
```

**Tree structure:**
```
0           ← top-level
├ 0.0       ← child of 0
│ └ 0.0.0   ← grandchild
└ 0.1       ← child of 0
```

**Rules:**
- A session completes only when all children complete
- Aborting a parent aborts all descendants
- Each session is independently attachable

**Pattern:** Fractal decomposition. Let Claude recursively break down complex tasks.

---

## Scope is a Substrate

**Scope is NOT an orchestrator.** It doesn't schedule tasks, manage dependencies, or auto-parallelize work.

**Scope IS a substrate** that provides:
- `spawn` — Launch a subagent, get an ID
- `wait` — Block until complete
- `poll` — Check status (non-blocking)
- Visibility — Real-time dashboard of all sessions
- Control — Attach, steer, abort anytime

**You build the orchestration layer** using these primitives. Scope is the medium. Your code (or Claude's reasoning) is the intelligence.

### Why This Matters

Other tools (Task, Explore) are opaque orchestrators—they decide how to parallelize, when to spawn, what to pass between steps. You get a black box.

Scope gives you **transparent building blocks**. Want DAG scheduling? Encode it yourself with `--after`. Want map-reduce? Spawn N subagents and aggregate results. Want actor model? Each session is an actor.

**The orchestration pattern is YOUR code, not Scope's.**

## Human Interface: The Dashboard

While Claude uses `spawn`/`wait`/`poll`, you observe and control via the dashboard:

```bash
scope
```

```
┌─ scope ────────────────────────────────────────────────── 3 running ─┐
│                                                                      │
│  ▼ 0   Refactor auth to JWT        ● running   waiting on children   │
│    ├ 0.0  Extract JWT helpers      ● running   editing token.ts      │
│    └ 0.1  Update middleware        ✓ done      ─                     │
│  ▶ 1   Write tests for user module ● running   jest --watch          │
│                                                                      │
├──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  n new   ↵ attach   x abort   d hide done                            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `n` | New session (opens Claude Code in split pane) |
| `enter` | Attach to selected session |
| `x` | Abort selected (and descendants) |
| `j/k` | Navigate |
| `h/l` | Collapse/expand |
| `d` | Toggle completed sessions |

**Key insight:** The dashboard is **read-only observation** of state that lives in `.scope/sessions/`. Scope doesn't orchestrate—it renders.

---

## Scope vs Task Tool

For Claude Code users wondering why not use the built-in Task/Explore agents:

| | Task Tool | Scope |
|---|---|---|
| **Visibility** | Opaque black box | Real-time dashboard |
| **Intervention** | None—wait and hope | Attach, steer, abort anytime |
| **Context** | Shares parent context | Fresh context per agent |
| **Parallelism** | Sequential only | Spawn many in parallel |
| **Nesting** | Limited | Unlimited hierarchy |
| **Debugging** | Results only | Full session inspection |
| **Philosophy** | Orchestrator (opinionated) | Substrate (bring your own logic) |

Task is an opinionated orchestrator. Scope is a **transparent protocol** for building orchestration.

## Before/After Example

**Without Scope (single session):**

```
Task 1: "Refactor auth module to use JWT"

Context after completion:
├─ Your original request:           2K tokens
├─ File reads (15 files):          45K tokens  ← bloat
├─ Failed approach 1:              12K tokens  ← bloat
├─ Successful implementation:      18K tokens
├─ Test code:                       8K tokens
└─ Total:                          85K tokens

Result: Implementation works ✓

─────────────────────────────────────────────

Task 2: "Now add rate limiting"

Context before this task:
├─ Compacted summary:              25K tokens  ← auth details lost!
├─ Your new request:                2K tokens
└─ Total available:                27K tokens

Problem: Critical JWT implementation details were summarized away.
Claude has to re-read files and re-explore the auth system.
```

**With Scope (orchestrated subagents):**

```
Task 1: "Refactor auth module to use JWT"

Main session context:
├─ Your original request:           2K tokens
├─ Orchestration commands:          1K tokens
├─ Subagent results (concise):      5K tokens  ← only the essentials
└─ Total:                           8K tokens

Each subagent runs independently with fresh 200K context.
Main session never sees the 15 file reads, failed attempts, or exploration.

Result: Implementation works ✓ + main session stays lean ✓

─────────────────────────────────────────────

Task 2: "Now add rate limiting"

Main session context:
├─ Full task 1 context:             8K tokens  ← nothing lost!
├─ Your new request:                2K tokens
└─ Total:                          10K tokens

Claude has complete context of JWT implementation via clean results.
No re-reading. No re-exploration. Just forward progress.
```

**The difference:** WITHOUT Scope, your second task starts with 27K of fragmented context. WITH Scope, it starts with 10K of complete, relevant context.

## How It Works

- **Each session** is a real Claude Code process in tmux
- **State lives** in `.scope/sessions/` (inspectable with `cat`, `tail`, `watch`)
- **Hooks track activity** automatically via Claude Code's hook system (PostToolUse, Stop)
- **The dashboard** watches `.scope/sessions/` for changes and updates instantly
- **Nesting** is automatic via `SCOPE_SESSION_ID` environment variable

**You can inspect state directly:**
```bash
cat .scope/sessions/0/task           # What's it doing?
cat .scope/sessions/0/state          # running | done | aborted
tail -f .scope/sessions/0/activity   # Live activity feed
cat .scope/sessions/0/result         # Final output
```

The entire Unix toolkit works. **The filesystem is the IPC layer.**

See [docs/02-architecture.md](docs/02-architecture.md) for technical details.

## Philosophy

### 1. Transparency over magic
No black boxes. The subagent's state is your state. `.scope/sessions/` is world-readable.

### 2. Control over autonomy
Intervention is a first-class feature, not an escape hatch. Attach and steer anytime.

### 3. Substrate over orchestrator
Scope provides primitives. You encode the intelligence.

### 4. Minimalism over ceremony
One command to spawn (`scope spawn`). One interface to observe (`scope`). Zero configuration to start.

See [docs/00-philosophy.md](docs/00-philosophy.md) for the full design philosophy.

## Integration Timeline

**5 minutes:** Install → setup → first spawn → see result
**15 minutes:** Parallel spawns → DAG dependencies → dashboard mastery
**30 minutes:** Hook integration → recursive decomposition → custom workflows

---

## When NOT to Use Scope

- **Single atomic tasks** — Don't spawn for a quick file read or one-line fix. Just do it inline.
- **Tight back-and-forth dialogue** — If the task requires iterative refinement, keep it in your main session.
- **Tasks requiring your running state** — If the subagent needs access to variables or state in your current context, don't spawn.

**Rule of thumb:** If the task would consume >30% of your context window, spawn. Otherwise, do it yourself.

---

## Troubleshooting

### `tmux: command not found`

Scope requires tmux to manage background sessions.

**Install tmux:**
- **macOS:** `brew install tmux`
- **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt install tmux`
- **Arch:** `sudo pacman -S tmux`

Then re-run `scope setup`.

### Hooks not working / Claude doesn't know about Scope

**Check hooks are installed:**
```bash
cat ~/.claude/settings.json | grep scope
```

You should see `PostToolUse` and `Stop` hooks pointing to `scope hook`.

**Fix:**
```bash
scope setup  # Re-run setup to reinstall hooks
```

### Session stuck in "running" state

If a session shows as running but Claude has crashed:

```bash
scope  # Open dashboard
# Navigate to stuck session and press 'x' to abort
```

Or manually:
```bash
cat .scope/sessions/0/tmux_session  # Get tmux session name
tmux kill-session -t scope-0        # Kill it manually
```

### Dashboard not updating

The dashboard watches `.scope/sessions/` for changes. If it's frozen:

1. Press `Ctrl+C` to quit and re-run `scope`
2. Check file permissions: `ls -la .scope/sessions/`
3. Verify hooks are running: `tail -f .scope/sessions/*/activity`

### Subagent can't find parent session context

When using `--after`, ensure parent sessions have written their results:

```bash
# Wait for dependencies before spawning
scope wait research audit
scope spawn "implement based on research + audit" --id impl
```
