GNS3 Project Path Tool.

This module provides a LangChain tool for retrieving GNS3 project paths.
These paths are needed for features like Notes to store markdown files
in the project directory.

Usage:
    from gns3_copilot.gns3_client.gns3_project_path import GNS3ProjectPath
    tool = GNS3ProjectPath()
    result = tool._run({"project_name": "mylab", "project_id": "uuid"})

    Tool to retrieve the local filesystem path of a GNS3 project.

    This tool connects to GNS3 server and retrieves the local path where
    project files are stored on the server. Useful for features that need to
    access project-specific files such as Notes.

    Input parameters:
    - project_name: Name of the GNS3 project (required)
    - project_id: The unique UUID identifier of project (required)

    Returns: Project path information including:
    - success: Whether the operation succeeded
    - project_path: Full path to the project directory on the server
    - project_name: Name of the project
    - project_id: UUID of the project
    - message: Status message

    Example output (success):
        {
            "success": true,
            "project_path": "/home/user/GNS3/projects/mylab",
