## Further Setup

In order for pygab and pyrab to correctly format batch files they need to know your account number. They read this account number from an environment variable `ACTNUM`. Ensure that you have set this environment variable.

There are other optional environment variables you can set below are their names, defaults, and what they change

- `DEFAULT_DFT_TIME`, 00:59:00,The default dft job time in a batch file.
- `DEFAULT_DFT_PROCESSORS`, 36, The default number of processors a DFT job will use

## Available Commands
All commands with a * next to their name have a help flag that can be accessed by passing the `-h` flag. This is not placed here to keep documentation succinct.
