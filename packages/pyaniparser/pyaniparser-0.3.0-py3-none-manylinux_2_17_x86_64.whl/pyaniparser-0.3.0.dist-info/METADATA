# PyAniParser

[**中文文档**](https://github.com/banned2054/PyAniParser/blob/master/Docs/README.md) | [**English Doc**](https://github.com/banned2054/PyAniParser/blob/master/README.md)

**PyAniParser** is a high-performance Python wrapper for [Banned.AniParser](https://github.com/banned2054/Banned.AniParser), designed to parse anime file names. Powered by **.NET 10 Native AOT**, it provides fast and accurate extraction of metadata (titles, episodes, resolutions, etc.) from complex file naming conventions.

> **Note**: This parser is currently optimized for **Chinese fansub naming conventions** (e.g., VCB-Studio, Nekomoe, Sakurato).

## Features

- **High Performance**: Built with .NET Native AOT for speed and efficiency.
- **Robust Parsing**: specialized in handling complex naming schemes from various release groups.
- **Batch Processing**: Optimized for processing large lists of files.
- **Globalization Support**: Built-in Traditional to Simplified Chinese conversion.
- **Type Hinting**: Fully typed for better IDE support and development experience.

## Installation

```bash
pip install pyaniparser
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from pyaniparser import AniParser

# Initialize the parser
parser = AniParser()

# Parse a single file
result = parser.parse("[Nekomoe] Anime Title - 01 [1080p].mp4")
if result:
    print(f"Title: {result.title}")
    print(f"Episode: {result.episode}")

# Parse a batch of files (Recommended for lists)
files = ["File1.mp4", "File2.mp4"]
results = parser.parse_batch(files)

for item in results:
    print(item.title)
```

### Advanced Configuration (Globalization)

You can configure the parser to automatically convert Traditional Chinese titles to Simplified Chinese (or vice versa) upon initialization:

```python
# Options: "Simplified", "Traditional", or "NotChange" (Default)
parser = AniParser(globalization="Simplified")

result = parser.parse("[Group] 繁體標題 - 01.mp4")
print(result.title) # Output will be converted to Simplified Chinese
```

### Get Supported Groups

You can retrieve the list of currently supported subtitle and release groups programmatically:

```python
parser = AniParser()
groups = parser.get_parser_list()
print(groups)
```

## Supported Groups

PyAniParser includes built-in support for many major groups, including but not limited to:

- ANi
- 北宇治字幕组
- 喵萌奶茶屋
- 桜都字幕组
- Vcb-Studio
