def fricative(x,fs,t):
    """
    Measure fricative acoustic values, from a 20 ms window, centered on time `t`.

    In addition to reporting the spectral moments (COG, SD, skew, and kurtosis) of the multitaper spectrum (from `nitime.algorithms.multi_taper_psd()`), `fricative()` finds the "main peak" in the fricative spectrum.  For fricatives with a resonant cavity, this is the lowest resonance of the cavity.  
    For those with no resonance the main peak frequency may be more a property of the source function.
     
    The main peak heuristic is to start by looking the in the spectrum above 300 Hz, for the lowest frequency peak that is at least 50% of the amplitude range, separated from the nearest peak by at least 500Hz, and prominent by 8bB above the next nearest peak (see the **scipy.signal.find_peaks()** documentation).  If no peak is found, relax the prominence constraint, then the amplitude constraint, and then both. 

Parameters
==========

    x : ndarray
        a one-dimensional array of audio samples
    fs : int
        the sampling frequency of `x` (ideally should be at least 16000)
    t : float
        the time (in seconds) at which to take measurements (this is usually in a fricative, but doesn't have to be).


Returns
=======
     
namedtuple :
    A `FricMeas` namedtuple of fricative measures is returned, with the following fields:

        Fm : float
            Frequency (in Hz) of the first main spectral peak.  A measure correlated with the length of the front tube.
        Am : float
            Amplitude (in dB) at Fm
        AmpD : float
            The difference in amplitude (dB) between the higher of Am or Asec and the minimum amplitude between 500Hz and Fm.  A measure of sibilance.
        Fsec : float 
            Frequency of the second major peak in the spectrum.  If the front tube is long there can be a second resonance. If there is no second major peak, this field's value is `None`
        Asec: float
            Amplitude (in dB) at Fsec. If there is no second major peak, this field's value is `None`
        mode : string
            a report on the peak finding parameters used
        COG : float
            center of gravity, the first moment of the spectrum.
        SD : float
            standard deviation, the second moment of the spectrum.
        Skew : float
            scaled third moment, skew
        Kurtosis : float
            scaled fourth moment, kurtosis
        spec : ndarray
            the multi-taper power spectrum at the midpoint (e.g. for use in plotting spectra)
        freq : ndarray
            the frequency scale of the spectrum (e.g. for use in plotting spectra)

Note
====

    The major peaks analysis implemented here draws on ideas from Shadle (2023) and Shadle et al. (2023).   Moments analysis was introduced for analysis of stop release burst spectra by Forrest et al. (1988).

Example
=======

    This example returns fricative measurements from time 2.25 seconds in the 
    audio samples returned by `loadsig()`. The major peak and COG frequencies 
    are indicated in a plot of the spectrum.

    .. code-block:: Python
    
         x, fs = phon.loadsig("sf3_cln.wav")
         y, fs = phon.prep_audio(x, fs, target_fs=16000)
         fricm = phon.fricative(y, fs, 2.25)

         print(f"first major peak at {fricm.Fm:.1f}, Center of Gravity is {fricm.COG:.1f}")
         plt.plot(fricm.freq, fricm.spec)
         plt.axvline(fricm.Fm, color="red")
         plt.axvline(fricm.COG, color="green")

The figure here shows major peaks and COG in several different fricatives.
