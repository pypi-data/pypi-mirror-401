        The first Timebox is for the control signal delay, and the second has a ConditionalInstruction.
        The delay TimeBox operates only on a virtual channel and is used to block the pulse TimeBox
        until there has been enough time for the control signal to arrive.
        The delay is specified by the ``control_delays`` gate parameter.

        In normal operation, the boxes can be placed sequentially without causing unnecessary delays.
        To care of the timing yourself, simply ignore the first TimeBox.

            feedback_key: Identifies the feedback signal if ``feedback_qubit`` was measured multiple times.
                The feedback label is then ``f"{feedback_qubit}__{feedback_key}"``.
                TODO: currently the HW does not support multiple feedback keys per drive channel, so this argument has
