# Getting Started with RAG Memory

## Goal

Guide the user through understanding and setting up RAG Memory, one step at a time.

## Expected Outcomes

By the end, the user should:
1. Understand what RAG Memory is and its capabilities
2. Have it installed and running
3. Have collections set up for their use cases
4. Have tested search and graph queries

## How to Execute

1. Read the root README.md to understand the project structure and components
2. Read .reference/README.md to see what documentation is available
3. Present the user with a menu of learning paths
4. For their chosen path, read the relevant .reference/ file and walk them through it
5. Present ONE step at a time, wait for user response before continuing
6. After completing a path, offer to continue to another or end

## Menu Options

1. **Understand the Concepts** - What is RAG? Semantic search? Knowledge graphs?
2. **Learn the Capabilities** - What can RAG Memory do for me?
3. **Install and Configure** - Get it running
4. **Show Me the Commands** - CLI and MCP tool reference

## Rules

- All content comes from reading the actual documentation
- Present one step at a time, wait for user response
- Search examples must be full questions (semantic search), not keywords
- For installation: give instructions, don't run setup commands for the user
