# AP2 Protocol Tools

This module provides a collection of orthogonal tools for building and verifying AP2 protocol data structures, such as `CartMandate`, `PaymentMandate`, and receipt credentials.

## Core Principles

The library is designed with the following principles in mind:

- **Solid Foundation**: Prioritizes reliability and correctness over cleverness. It's built on `pydantic` for robust data validation.
- **Extensible Architecture**: The data models and functions are designed to be composed, allowing developers to easily build complex workflows.
- **API Orthogonality**: Each component has a clear and distinct responsibility. `cart_mandate` tools handle cart logic, `payment_mandate` handles payment authorization, and `credential_mandate` handles issuing receipts.
- **Clear Documentation**: All major functions and models are clearly documented.

## Usage

The primary workflow involves two parties: a "shopper" and a "merchant". The process generally follows these steps:
1. The shopper requests a `CartMandate` from the merchant.
2. The merchant creates and signs a `CartMandate` and sends it back.
3. The shopper verifies the `CartMandate`, then creates and signs a `PaymentMandate` that includes a hash of the original cart.
4. The merchant receives and verifies the `PaymentMandate`, confirming the payment authorization.
5. The merchant issues a signed `PaymentReceipt` credential to the shopper.
6. The shopper verifies the `PaymentReceipt` to ensure its authenticity.

### Core Components

The module provides three main types of components:
- **Data Models**: `pydantic` models representing the core data structures (e.g., `CartMandate`, `PaymentMandateContents`, `PaymentReceipt`).
- **Builders**: Functions to construct and sign mandates and credentials (e.g., `build_cart_mandate`, `build_payment_receipt`).
- **Validators**: Functions to verify the integrity and signature of mandates and credentials (e.g., `validate_payment_mandate`, `validate_credential`).

### Example: Creating and Verifying a Full Flow

This example demonstrates a complete interaction from cart creation to receipt issuance.

```python
import json
from datetime import datetime, timezone

# Helper for loading keys (in a real app, manage these securely)
from anp.utils.crypto_tool import load_private_key_from_string
# Import models, builders, and validators
from anp.ap2.models import (
    CartContents,
    CartMandate,
    MoneyAmount,
    PaymentDetails,
    PaymentDetailsTotal,
    PaymentMandateContents,
    PaymentReceiptContents,
    PaymentRequest,
    PaymentResponse,
    PaymentResponseDetails,
    PaymentStatus,
)
from anp.ap2.cart_mandate import build_cart_mandate, validate_cart_mandate
