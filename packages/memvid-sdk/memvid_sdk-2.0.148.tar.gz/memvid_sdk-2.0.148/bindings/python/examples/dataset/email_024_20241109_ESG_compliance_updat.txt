**Subject:** ESG Compliance Update for Acme Corporation  

Dear Marcus,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the ESG compliance initiatives we are implementing at Acme Corporation following our recent review on September 15, 2023. As you know, the impact of these initiatives is crucial not only for regulatory compliance but also for positioning Acme as a leader in sustainable practices within the manufacturing sector.

As of today, Acme has successfully completed the first phase of the ESG framework implementation, which included a comprehensive evaluation of their current practices against the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) standards. Notably, Acme has achieved a 25% reduction in carbon emissions since the start of Q3 2023, surpassing our initial target of 20% by year-end.

In addition, Acme has committed to increasing transparency in their supply chain operations. They are currently in discussions with five key suppliers to establish more stringent sustainability criteria, with the goal of onboarding at least three by the end of Q4 2023. This aligns with our long-term strategy of enhancing supply chain sustainability and reducing overall risk exposure.

However, there are a few challenges we must address. During our latest meeting with the Acme leadership team, they expressed concerns about the potential costs associated with implementing the new waste management protocols mandated by the upcoming local regulations. The estimated investment is around $1.2 million, which will need to be justified through projected long-term savings and compliance risk mitigation. I recommend we discuss this in our upcoming investment committee meeting on October 25, 2023.

Lastly, I suggest we prepare an ESG performance report to present to the board at our quarterly review on November 15, 2023. This will help demonstrate our commitment to sustainable investment practices and reinforce Acme's position as a socially responsible enterprise.

Please let me know if you would like to discuss this further or if there are any specific areas you'd like me to focus on for the upcoming meeting.

Best regards,

Jessica Tan
