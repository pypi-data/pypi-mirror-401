Subject: New deal pipeline review - Acme Corporation

**From:** Jane Thompson, Managing Director  
**To:** John Richards, Senior Associate  
**Cc:** Michelle Wu, Analyst; David Patel, Principal  
**Date:** October 3, 2023  
**Subject:** New Deal Pipeline Review

Dear John,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach our quarterly strategy meeting scheduled for October 15, I would like to review the current status of our deal pipeline, particularly in relation to Acme Corporation.

As you know, Acme Corporation has shown promising growth in the past year, with a 15% increase in EBITDA year-over-year, now reporting an EBITDA of $12 million for Q3 2023. This continued performance strengthens our position as we consider potential add-on acquisitions to further enhance their market share and operational efficiencies.

I would like to highlight the following key opportunities in our pipeline:

1. **XYZ Technologies**: A software firm specializing in automation solutions, currently priced at $45 million. Initial due diligence indicates a robust revenue stream of $10 million, with a projected 20% annual growth. The management team has expressed interest in a strategic partnership and is keen on leveraging Acme's distribution channel.

2. **ABC Manufacturing**: Valued at approximately $30 million, this company operates in a niche that aligns with Acme’s offerings. Their EBITDA stands at $4 million with substantial room for operational improvements. I believe this could be an excellent opportunity to implement cost-saving measures that we’ve identified in previous analyses.

3. **DEF Services**: This potential target has a valuation of $25 million and delivers services in the same sector as Acme. Their current financial health is stable, but they lack the technological infrastructure that Acme can provide, which could lead to significant synergies.

I would appreciate your insights on these opportunities, particularly regarding the level of interest and any preliminary feedback from the respective management teams. Additionally, please prepare an update on the financial and operational performance of Acme Corporation to review in our meeting.

Let’s aim to finalize our assessments by October 10, so we can present a cohesive strategy to the investment committee next week. 

Best regards,

Jane Thompson
