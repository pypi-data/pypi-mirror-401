Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. Following our recent review of TechStart Inc.'s performance metrics and growth trajectory, I wanted to discuss potential debt refinancing options that could enhance their capital structure and overall strategic positioning.

As you are aware, TechStart currently has an outstanding debt balance of $30 million, with a weighted average interest rate of 7.5%. Given the current market environment and recent interest rate trends, there may be opportunities to refinance this debt at a more favorable rate. The recent reports indicate that comparable companies are securing debt at rates as low as 5.0%, which could significantly reduce TechStart's annual interest burden.

I propose we engage with a few investment banks, such as JP Morgan and Goldman Sachs, to explore refinancing options. Additionally, we should consider involving our existing lender, Crescent Capital, to assess their willingness to adjust the terms or provide a new facility. The goal would be to lower the interest rate and possibly extend the maturity date, providing TechStart with enhanced cash flow flexibility as they pursue their growth strategy.

I recommend we set up a meeting with our financial advisors next week to review various scenarios and potential impacts on TechStart's capital structure. Given their projected EBITDA growth of 25% year-over-year through 2025, it is crucial that we act swiftly to capitalize on this opportunity.

Please let me know your availability for a discussion, as well as any preliminary thoughts on the potential implications for our investment thesis.

Best regards,
