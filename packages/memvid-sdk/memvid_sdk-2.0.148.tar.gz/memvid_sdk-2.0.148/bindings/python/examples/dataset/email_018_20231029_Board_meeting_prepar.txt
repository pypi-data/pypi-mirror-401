Dear David,

As we gear up for the upcoming board meeting for Meridian Holdings scheduled for October 30, 2023, I wanted to outline a few key points that we ought to cover to ensure a productive discussion.

First, we should review the financial performance metrics for Q3 2023. As you know, Meridian has achieved a revenue growth of 15% year-over-year, with total revenues reaching $22 million, up from $19.1 million in Q3 2022. It would be beneficial to compare these figures against our initial projections for this fiscal year and highlight the factors contributing to this growth, particularly the successful rollout of the new product line in July.

Additionally, we need to address the operational challenges that Meridian has faced recently, specifically regarding supply chain disruptions. The increased costs have resulted in a slight dip in EBITDA margins, down to 24% from 27% last year. We should prepare a few strategies for the board to consider, including potential partnerships with alternative suppliers and the implementation of more robust inventory management systems.

Moreover, we should gather feedback from the recent employee engagement survey, which indicated a 75% satisfaction rate but highlighted areas for improvement in inter-departmental communication. Addressing this during the board meeting will be crucial as we work towards our goal of enhancing the company culture.

Lastly, I propose we allocate some time to discuss the potential acquisition of TechWave Solutions, as it aligns with our strategic goals of expanding Meridian's digital capabilities. If we could finalize our analysis and valuation before the board meeting, it would provide a solid foundation for our recommendation.

Please let me know your thoughts on these agenda items, and if there are any additional points you believe we should include. I look forward to collaborating on this.

Best regards,
