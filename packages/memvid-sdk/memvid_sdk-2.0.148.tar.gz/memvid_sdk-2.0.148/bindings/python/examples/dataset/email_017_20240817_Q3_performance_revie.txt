**Subject:** Q3 Performance Review for Acme Corporation  

Dear Sarah and Robert,

I hope this message finds you well. As we approach the upcoming quarterly board meeting scheduled for October 20, I wanted to share an initial overview of Acme Corporation’s performance for Q3 2023, along with some strategic considerations moving forward.

Acme reported a revenue of $45 million for Q3, which represents a 10% increase compared to Q3 2022. This growth can largely be attributed to the successful launch of their new product line in July, which has exceeded sales projections by approximately 15%. Additionally, gross margins improved to 42%, up from 39% in the previous quarter, reflecting better cost management and pricing strategies.

However, it's important to note that the EBITDA margin has contracted slightly to 22% from 24% in Q2 2023, primarily due to increased logistics costs and supply chain disruptions that have affected their operations. The management team is actively addressing these issues, and I recommend we discuss potential strategies to mitigate these costs at the board meeting.

In terms of cash flow, Acme reported a net cash inflow of $5 million, bringing their cash reserves to $20 million as of September 30, 2023. This liquidity gives us room to support their initiatives, but we should remain vigilant about their capital allocation strategies.

Looking ahead, we should consider the implications of their upcoming marketing campaign set for late Q4, which aims to capture additional market share. I believe it will be crucial for us to provide support in optimizing the marketing budget to maximize ROI.

Please review the attached financial statements and let me know your thoughts before our internal prep call on October 12. I also recommend that we outline specific KPIs to assess Acme’s performance more effectively moving into 2024.

Thank you, and I look forward to your insights.
