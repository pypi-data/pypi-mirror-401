**Subject:** ESG Compliance Update for Pinnacle Financial  

Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide you with an update regarding the ESG compliance initiatives we are implementing for our portfolio company, Pinnacle Financial, as we approach the end of Q3 2023.

As of October 15, 2023, Pinnacle has successfully completed its first ESG impact assessment, which evaluated key performance indicators across environmental, social, and governance dimensions. The assessment revealed that Pinnacle has made significant strides in reducing its carbon footprint, achieving a 15% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions year-over-year. This progress aligns with our target of a 25% reduction by 2025, and I believe it positions us well to attract further investment in the sustainability space.

On the social front, Pinnacle has launched a community outreach program dedicated to financial literacy in underserved areas, reaching over 2,000 individuals in the last quarter alone. The feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with a reported 85% of participants feeling more confident in managing their personal finances. This initiative not only enhances Pinnacle’s brand reputation but also demonstrates our commitment to social responsibility.

Governance has remained a focus as well, with Pinnacle recently appointing two independent board members who bring a wealth of experience in ESG strategy. This change is expected to enhance decision-making processes and reinforce our commitment to transparency and ethical governance practices.

Looking ahead, I recommend we schedule a strategy session with Pinnacle's executive team in early November to discuss our 2024 ESG goals and how we can further leverage these initiatives to improve both value creation and investor confidence.

Please let me know your availability for a preliminary discussion before I reach out to Pinnacle.

Best regards,
