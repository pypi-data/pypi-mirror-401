Dear Mark,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to follow up on our recent discussions regarding the sector rotation strategy for our portfolio, specifically concerning GreenField Energy.

As we know, the energy sector has been experiencing considerable volatility, with recent shifts in market sentiment due to fluctuating oil prices and the increasing demand for renewable solutions. As of October 10, 2023, Brent Crude oil traded at $92.50 per barrel, a 10% increase from the previous month, which has implications for our valuation of GreenField, currently estimated at $450 million.

Given the anticipated regulatory changes in Q1 2024, particularly the new carbon emissions tax legislation, I recommend we reassess our investment thesis for GreenField. The management team has indicated readiness to pivot towards a more diversified energy mix, focusing on solar and wind initiatives. Their Q3 performance report highlighted a 15% growth in their renewable segment, which now represents 30% of their total revenue.

To capitalize on this momentum, I propose that we explore increasing our equity stake from 30% to 45% by Q2 2024. This would enhance our influence over strategic decision-making while positioning us favorably as GreenField seeks to expand its renewable portfolio. Additionally, we should consider engaging with potential co-investors to mitigate our risk exposure while still benefitting from a larger stake.

I suggest we schedule a meeting next week to delve deeper into this strategy. Please let me know your availability, as I believe a thorough discussion will help us align our objectives and set the groundwork for a successful transition.

Looking forward to your feedback.

Best,
