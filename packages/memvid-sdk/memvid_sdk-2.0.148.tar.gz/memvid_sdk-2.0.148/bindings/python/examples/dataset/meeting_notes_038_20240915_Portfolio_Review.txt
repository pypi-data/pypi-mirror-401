Date: September 15, 2024  
Attendees: Jennifer Liu, David Kim, Marcus Webb, Amanda Foster, James Morrison, Sarah Chen

**Discussion Points:**

1. **Co-investment Opportunity with Tech Innovations Inc.**  
   Marcus Webb presented an investment proposal for a co-investment opportunity in Tech Innovations Inc., a leading software development company specializing in AI-driven solutions for healthcare. Tech Innovations is seeking $5 million in additional funding to expand its product line and enter new markets, particularly in Europe and Asia. The firm currently holds a 25% stake in Tech Innovations, and the proposed co-investment would increase this to 30%.

2. **Current Portfolio Performance**  
   Amanda Foster provided a quarterly performance update on our existing portfolio companies. Notably, GreenEnergy Corp. has exceeded projections with a year-over-year revenue increase of 15%, driven by new contracts in the renewable energy sector. In contrast, Retail Solutions LLC has underperformed due to supply chain disruptions, with an 8% decline in sales compared to Q2 2023.

3. **Market Trends and Economic Outlook**  
   Sarah Chen shared insights from recent market analyses, highlighting a shift towards tech investments following the post-pandemic recovery. The U.S. tech sector is projected to grow by 8% annually over the next five years, while healthcare technology is expected to see a surge of 12% in growth driven by increased demand for telehealth services.

4. **Risk Assessment**  
   David Kim led a discussion on the risk assessment of the proposed co-investment. Potential risks include market saturation and regulatory challenges in the healthcare sector. However, the overall reward potential, estimated at a 20% IRR over five years, was viewed positively.

**Key Decisions Made:**
- Approved the pursuit of the co-investment opportunity in Tech Innovations Inc. with a commitment of up to $3 million, contingent on further due diligence.
- Agreed to monitor Retail Solutions LLC closely and develop a turnaround strategy, including potential restructuring discussions by the end of Q4 2024.
