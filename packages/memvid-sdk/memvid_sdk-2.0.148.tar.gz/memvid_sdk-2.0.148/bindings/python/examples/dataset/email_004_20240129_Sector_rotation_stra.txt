**Subject:** Discussion on Sector Rotation Strategy – GreenField Energy  

Dear Team,

I hope this message finds you well. After our recent performance review of GreenField Energy, I wanted to share my thoughts on implementing a sector rotation strategy that could optimize our investment returns in the upcoming quarters.

As you are aware, GreenField has been a strong performer in the renewable energy sector, with revenue growth of 35% year-over-year as of Q3 2023. However, market indicators suggest that we may soon see a shift in investor sentiment toward traditional energy sources, particularly as geopolitical tensions in Eastern Europe are likely to influence oil prices. With Brent crude trading at $83.50 per barrel currently, there is potential for short-term gains in fossil fuels, especially as OPEC+ is expected to maintain current production cuts through Q1 2024.

I propose that we consider reallocating a portion of our capital—approximately $10 million—from GreenField’s expansion initiatives to establish a position in select traditional energy stocks. This would not only enhance our portfolio diversification but also allow us to capitalize on the anticipated short-term price spikes.

I suggest we convene a meeting next week, perhaps on November 22, to discuss this strategy in detail. In the meantime, I would appreciate it if you could gather some data on potential targets in the traditional energy sector, along with a risk assessment to present during our discussion. Andrew, please initiate a preliminary analysis of the implications for GreenField’s growth trajectory should we proceed with this strategy.

Looking forward to your insights.

Best,  
James H. Thompson
