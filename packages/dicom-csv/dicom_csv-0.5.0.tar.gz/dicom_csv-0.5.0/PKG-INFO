# Example load 3D image
from a series of dicom files (each containing 2D image)

```python
from dicom_csv import join_tree, order_series, stack_images
from pydicom import dcmread
from pathlib import Path

# 1. Collect metadata from all dicom files
folder = Path('/path/to/folder/')
meta = join_tree(folder, verbose=2)

# 2. Select series to load
uid = '...' # unique identifier of a series you want to load,
            # you could list them by `meta.SeriesInstanceUID.unique()`
series = meta.query("SeriesInstanceUID==@uid")

# 3. Read files & combine them into a single volume
images2d = [dcmread(folder / row[1].PathToFolder / row[1].FileName) for row in series.iterrows()] 
image3d = stack_images(order_series(images2d))
```
