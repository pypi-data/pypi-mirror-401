Generate a PR title and body for the changes on this branch.

Review the diff against main and summarize what changed and why.

## Output format

Return a structured response with:
- **title**: lowercase, with optional area prefix (e.g. `llm_http: add structured output`)
- **body**: markdown with headers, code blocks for commands, and bullet lists

## Title style

Titles are lowercase and concise. Use an area prefix when changes are focused on a specific module or feature area. The area can be new or existing.

Examples:
- `llm_http: add structured output for pr messages`
- `pr workflow: add -a flag to commit and push`
- `fix worktree cleanup on branch delete`

## Body style

Use markdown headers to organize the body. Open with a "Usage" or "Try it" section showing commands in code blocks. Then explain what changed.

Structure:
1. **Usage section** (header + code block) - how to try it, run it, or see it in action
2. **Summary** - one paragraph explaining what this PR does and why
3. **Changes** (optional) - bullet list of notable changes if helpful

Keep it medium length. Stay high-level; don't enumerate every file.
