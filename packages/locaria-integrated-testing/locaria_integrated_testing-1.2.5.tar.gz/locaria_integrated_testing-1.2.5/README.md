# Locaria Integrated Testing Framework

A lightweight, automated testing system for data pipelines and tools. Focuses on business-logic validation, data quality checks, and operational sanity tests rather than UI or cosmetic testing.

## Features

- **Business Logic Validation** - Test time splits sum to 100%, financial ratios are within bounds, etc.
- **Data Quality Checks** - Schema validation, null checks, row count sanity, data freshness
- **Configurable Thresholds** - Firestore-based configuration for easy threshold updates
- **Integrated Logging** - BigQuery batch logging with consolidated test results (one row per test, grouping multiple issues)
- **Email Alerts** - Real-time failure notifications via existing email manager API
- **Pipeline-Specific Tests** - Custom business logic validation for different data domains

## Quick Start

### Basic Usage

> **⚠️ Deprecation Notice**: The `issue_owner` and `issue_ack_access` parameters are deprecated and maintained only for backwards compatibility. Access and email control should now be managed through the [Acknowledgment Manager Access Control](https://locaria-dev-finance-reports.ew.r.appspot.com/admin/ack-manager-access-control) interface. See the [Access Control documentation](../FIN_profitability_gcp/documentation/tools/acknowledgment_manager/access_control_how_to_use.md) for details.

All generic test methods support two optional permission fields (deprecated, for backwards compatibility only):

- `issue_owner` – who should receive the alert email (string or list, defaults to `"analytics_hub.data_team_ack"`).
- `issue_ack_access` – who should be able to view/acknowledge the issue in the FIN Profitability acknowledgment manager (defaults to `issue_owner`, but can differ).

**Use Access Control instead**: Manage access grants through the [Acknowledgment Manager Access Control](https://locaria-dev-finance-reports.ew.r.appspot.com/admin/ack-manager-access-control) web interface. This allows you to control who can view and acknowledge issues, as well as configure email routing, without modifying pipeline code.

```python
from locaria_integrated_testing import DataQualityTests, FreshnessTests, RowCountTests, DuplicateTests, create_testkit

# Initialize TestKit directly (works with any configstore or no configstore)
testkit = create_testkit(
    repository_name="your_repository",
    pipeline_name="your_pipeline",
    bigquery_client=None,  # Required: BigQuery client instance for test result logging
    firestore_project_id=None,  # Optional: defaults to "locaria-dev-config-store"
    fail_on_error=False  # Optional: if True, pipeline stops on test failures
)

# Initialize test classes
data_quality_tests = DataQualityTests(testkit, caller_script="your_pipeline.py")
freshness_tests = FreshnessTests(testkit, caller_script="your_pipeline.py")
row_count_tests = RowCountTests(testkit, caller_script="your_pipeline.py")
duplicate_tests = DuplicateTests(testkit, caller_script="your_pipeline.py")

try:
    # Your data pipeline code
    df = extract_data()
    
    # Stage 1: Data quality tests with explicit permissions
    data_quality_tests.check_data_completeness(
        df, 
        completeness_threshold=0.95,
        issue_owner="analytics_hub.data_team_ack",
        issue_ack_access="analytics_hub.ops_ack"
    )
    duplicate_tests.check_duplicate_records(
        df, 
        ["employee_id", "date"],
        issue_owner="analytics_hub.data_team_ack",
        issue_ack_access="analytics_hub.ops_ack"
    )
    
    # Stage 2: Transform and load
    df_transformed = transform_data(df)
    row_count_tests.check_row_count_change(
        df_transformed, 
        "table_name", 
        "append",
        issue_owner="analytics_hub.data_team_ack",
        issue_ack_access="analytics_hub.ops_ack"
    )
    
    # Stage 3: Freshness checks
    load_to_bq(df_transformed, table="finance.time_splits")
    freshness_tests.check_data_freshness(
        df_transformed, 
        "timestamp",
        issue_owner="analytics_hub.data_team_ack",
        issue_ack_access="analytics_hub.ops_ack"
    )
    
finally:
    # Always finalize the test run
    testkit.finalize_run()
```

## Environment Setup

The framework is configstore-agnostic and accepts arguments directly. You can use it with any configstore implementation or without one entirely. TestKit requires a BigQuery client for logging test results to BigQuery.

### Required Parameters

- **bigquery_client**: A Google Cloud BigQuery client instance. This is required for logging test results to the `locaria-dev-config-store.cross_project_logging.integrated_test_logs` table.

### Optional Environment Variables

For configuration when not using a configstore:

```bash
# Email API configuration (fallback)
export EMAIL_API_URL="https://your-app.appspot.com/api/tools/send_email_direct"
```

### Default Configuration

The framework uses sensible defaults when parameters are not provided:
- **Firestore Project**: `locaria-dev-config-store` (default, can be overridden via `firestore_project_id`)
- **BigQuery Logging**: Test results are written to `locaria-dev-config-store.cross_project_logging.integrated_test_logs` during `finalize_run()`. Results are consolidated by test name: when a test generates multiple issues (e.g., 40 duplicate warnings), they are grouped into a single summary row with a succinct message showing the count and first few identifiers, with full details stored in the metrics JSON field.
- **Email API**: Can be configured via environment variable `EMAIL_API_URL`

If you're using a configstore (like the one in locate_2_pulls), you can extract values from it and pass them to TestKit. The framework doesn't depend on any specific configstore implementation.

## Test Classes

### SchemaTests

Schema validation tests for data quality assurance:

- `check_required_columns()` - Validate required columns exist
- `check_data_types()` - Validate column data types
- `check_null_constraints()` - Check for nulls in critical fields
- `check_unique_constraints()` - Validate unique key constraints
- `check_column_values()` - Check values within expected ranges or sets
- `check_schema_completeness()` - Comprehensive schema validation

### DataQualityTests

Data quality tests for common validation scenarios. All methods support optional `issue_owner` (email recipients) and `issue_ack_access` (acknowledgment UI access) parameters for permission management:

- `check_numeric_ranges()` - Values within expected ranges
- `check_data_completeness()` - Data completeness above threshold
- `check_column_completeness()` - Column-level completeness validation
- `check_date_ranges()` - Date values within reasonable bounds

### FreshnessTests

Data freshness tests for ensuring data is up-to-date. All methods support optional `issue_owner` / `issue_ack_access` parameters:

- `check_data_freshness()` - Verify data is up-to-date
- `check_timestamp_progression()` - Timestamps moving forward
- `check_data_consistency()` - Data frequency and gap validation
- `check_partition_freshness()` - BigQuery partition freshness validation
- `check_data_age_distribution()` - Data age distribution analysis

## Configuration

Configuration is stored in Firestore in the `locaria-dev-config-store` project (default, can be overridden via `firestore_project_id` parameter) under the `integrated_testing_config` collection.

### Default Configuration

```json
{
  "thresholds": {
    "row_count_change": {
      "warn_percentage": 20,
      "fail_percentage": 50
    },
    "out_of_office_percentage": {
      "warn_threshold": 25,
      "fail_threshold": 35
    },
    "time_split_tolerance": {
      "precision": 0.01
    },
    "data_freshness": {
      "max_age_hours": 24,
      "warn_age_hours": 12
    }
  },
  "test_switches": {
    "enable_schema_validation": true,
    "enable_business_logic_checks": true,
    "enable_freshness_checks": true,
    "enable_row_count_validation": true
  },
  "email_alerts": {
    "failure_recipients": ["data_team@locaria.com"],
    "warning_recipients": ["data_team@locaria.com"],
    "digest_frequency": "daily"
  }
}
```

### Managing Configuration

```python
from modules.integrated_tests import ConfigManager

# Initialize config manager
config_manager = ConfigManager()

# Create default configuration for a repository
config_manager.create_default_config_for_repository("your_repository")

# Update thresholds
config_manager.update_thresholds(
    "your_repository",
    "row_count_change",
    {"warn_percentage": 15, "fail_percentage": 40}
)

# Update test switches
config_manager.update_test_switches(
    "your_repository",
    {"enable_schema_validation": False}
)
```

## Test Severity Levels

- **FAIL** - Stops pipeline execution, logs error, sends immediate email alert
- **WARN** - Continues pipeline execution, logs warning, sends digest email
- **PASS** - Test passed, logs success

## Email Templates

The framework uses pre-configured email templates in the email manager:

- **Test Failure Alert** - Immediate notification for FAIL results
- **Test Warning Digest** - Grouped notification for WARN results

### Permission-Aware Recipients

When you include an `issue_owner` permission (string or list) in the `metrics` of
`log_warn`/`log_fail`, TestKit now looks up the Access Controller Firestore
(`locaria-prod-authenticator`) to determine which users have that permission.
Their email addresses are automatically appended to the `send_email_direct`
request (using `append_recipients`) so the correct acknowledge owners are
copied without manual configuration.

Override the lookup project with `TESTKIT_ACCESS_CONTROL_PROJECT=<project_id>`
if you maintain a different Access Controller instance. If the resolver cannot
connect (e.g., missing credentials), the framework gracefully falls back to the
static recipients configured in Firestore.

#### Email Routing Grants

In addition to `issue_owner` permissions set in pipeline code, TestKit also queries
email routing grants from the Acknowledgment Manager Access Control system. Grants
with `email_routing: true` can add additional email recipients based on repository,
pipeline, and test matching. This allows admins to configure email routing through
a web interface without modifying pipeline code.

When `finalize_run()` is called, TestKit:
1. Collects permissions from `issue_owner` and `issue_ack_access` fields (as before)
2. Queries Firestore for grants with `email_routing: true`
3. Matches grants against each issue's repository, pipeline, and test_name
4. Adds permissions from matching grants to the email recipient list
5. Resolves all permissions to email addresses via PermissionResolver

Email routing grants use **OR logic** - they add recipients but don't replace `issue_owner`
recipients. This ensures backward compatibility while enabling flexible email routing
configuration.

## Acknowledgment System

The acknowledgment system prevents email spam by allowing users to acknowledge known issues, which mutes them for a configurable period. Both warnings and failures can be acknowledged and stored in Firestore.

> **⚠️ Deprecation Notice**: The `issue_owner` and `issue_ack_access` fields are deprecated and maintained only for backwards compatibility. Access and email control should now be managed through the [Acknowledgment Manager Access Control](https://locaria-dev-finance-reports.ew.r.appspot.com/admin/ack-manager-access-control) interface. See the [Access Control documentation](../FIN_profitability_gcp/documentation/tools/acknowledgment_manager/access_control_how_to_use.md) for details.

**Legacy fields (deprecated, for backwards compatibility only):**
- `issue_owner`: determines which permission group(s) receive the alert email. This field also serves as the default acknowledgment permission when `issue_ack_access` is not provided.
- `issue_ack_access`: (optional) determines who can see and acknowledge the issue in the Analytics Hub web interface. Provide this when you need a broader (or narrower) acknowledgment audience than the email recipients.

When you log an issue with `log_warn` or `log_fail`, you may still include one or both fields in the metrics dictionary for backwards compatibility. If you provide a list for either field, users with any of those permissions can acknowledge the issue. Users with admin permissions can see and acknowledge all issues regardless of the settings.

**Recommended approach**: Use the [Acknowledgment Manager Access Control](https://locaria-dev-finance-reports.ew.r.appspot.com/admin/ack-manager-access-control) web interface to manage access grants. This allows you to control who can view and acknowledge issues, as well as configure email routing, without modifying pipeline code. Grants can be configured at the repository, pipeline, or test level, providing flexible access control.

The system works by detecting issues during test execution and storing them in Firestore during `finalize_run()`. The email system checks acknowledgment status before sending notifications, preventing spam for known issues. Users can acknowledge issues through the web interface, which mutes them for a configurable period (default 7 days). When mute periods expire, the framework automatically archives the old issue and creates a new unacknowledged issue, ensuring issues reappear for review after their mute period ends. Archived issues are preserved in the `archives` subcollection for historical tracking.

### Firestore Structure

```text
Collection: pipeline_acknowledgments
└── Document: {repo}%{pipeline}%{test_name}
    └── Subcollection: issues
        └── Document: {issue_key_simple}
            - acknowledged: bool
            - muted_until: timestamp (UTC)
            - status: "WARN" or "FAIL"
            - identifier: str
            - details: str
            - issue_first_occurrence: timestamp (UTC)
            - issue_last_occurrence: timestamp (UTC)
            - issue_owner: str or List[str]
            - issue_ack_access: Optional[str or List[str]]
            - acknowledged_by / acknowledged_at / acknowledgment_reason
    └── Subcollection: archives
        └── Document: {issue_key_simple}
            - Archived issues (expired mutes or manually deleted)
```

### Web Interface

The acknowledgment system includes a modern web interface accessible at `/tools/acknowledgment-manager` in the [Analytics Hub](https://locaria-dev-finance-reports.ew.r.appspot.com/tools/acknowledgment-manager). The interface automatically filters issues based on your user permissions, showing only issues where you have the required `issue_ack_access` permission (or `issue_owner` when no explicit access list is provided).

The web interface provides real-time filtering by repository, pipeline, test type, and issue status. You can acknowledge or unacknowledge individual issues with configurable mute periods, view comprehensive issue information including first and last occurrence timestamps and ownership details, and perform bulk operations to handle multiple issues at once. When mute periods expire, the framework automatically archives the old issue and creates a new unacknowledged issue, ensuring issues reappear for review. Manual deletions are also archived for historical tracking.

## Best Practices

### Test Design

Focus on business logic and data quality rather than just schema validation. Use descriptive test names that clearly explain the business rule being validated. Test at multiple stages of your pipeline: during data intake, after transformation, after loading to BigQuery, and in post-load validation. Include both positive and negative test cases to ensure comprehensive coverage.

### Permission Management

> **⚠️ Deprecation Notice**: The `issue_owner` and `issue_ack_access` parameters are deprecated and maintained only for backwards compatibility. Access and email control should now be managed through the [Acknowledgment Manager Access Control](https://locaria-dev-finance-reports.ew.r.appspot.com/admin/ack-manager-access-control) interface. See the [Access Control documentation](../FIN_profitability_gcp/documentation/tools/acknowledgment_manager/access_control_how_to_use.md) for details.

**Use Access Control instead**: Manage access and email routing through the [Acknowledgment Manager Access Control](https://locaria-dev-finance-reports.ew.r.appspot.com/admin/ack-manager-access-control) web interface. This allows you to:
- Grant access to repositories, pipelines, or specific tests without modifying code
- Control email routing through grants with the "Also control email routing" option
- Update access control dynamically without code deployments
- Configure access at any level (repository-wide, pipeline-specific, or test-specific)

**Legacy approach (deprecated)**: If you must use the legacy `issue_owner` parameter for backwards compatibility, explicitly specify it when calling test methods. Use a single permission string for issues that should be handled by one team, or a list of permissions when multiple teams need access. When the people who should acknowledge an issue differ from the people who should be emailed, add an `issue_ack_access` list so the right teams can mute issues without spamming the wider distribution. The default `"analytics_hub.data_team_ack"` (defined in `config_manager.DEFAULT_ISSUE_OWNER_PERMISSION`) remains appropriate for most data quality issues unless you need to route alerts elsewhere.

### Error Handling

Always use try/finally blocks to ensure `testkit.finalize_run()` executes even when exceptions occur. This guarantees that test results are logged and emails are sent. Handle missing data gracefully by checking for None or empty DataFrames before running tests. Provide meaningful error messages that include context about what data was being tested and why the test failed. Log sufficient context in the metrics dictionary to enable effective debugging later.

### Performance

Batch test operations when possible to reduce overhead. Use efficient pandas operations like vectorized comparisons rather than iterating over rows. Avoid unnecessary data copies by working with views or using in-place operations when appropriate. Cache configuration values when they're accessed frequently during a pipeline run.

### Configuration

Use Firestore for dynamic configuration that can be updated without code changes. Provide sensible defaults for all thresholds and settings. Document all thresholds and switches clearly so other team members understand what each setting controls. Version control configuration changes by tracking them in your repository's changelog or configuration management system.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **BigQuery Logging Not Working**
   - Verify BigQuery client is properly initialized
   - Check BigQuery permissions for the service account
   - Ensure `cross_project_logging` dataset exists in `locaria-dev-config-store`
   - Verify `integrated_test_logs` table exists or can be created

2. **Email Alerts Not Sending**
   - Check `EMAIL_API_URL` environment variable
   - Verify email templates are configured in email manager
   - Check network connectivity

3. **Firestore Configuration Issues**
   - Verify `locaria-dev-config-store` project access
   - Check collection and document permissions
   - Ensure configuration document exists

4. **Test Failures**
   - Check test thresholds in Firestore
   - Verify data quality and schema
   - Review test logic and business rules

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting the log level in configuration:

```python
config_manager.update_repository_config(
    "your_repository",
    {"logging": {"log_level": "DEBUG"}}
)
```

## Contributing

When adding new tests:

1. Follow the existing naming conventions
2. Include comprehensive error handling
3. Add configuration options for thresholds
4. Update documentation
5. Add examples for new functionality
