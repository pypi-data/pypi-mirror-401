He has over 20 years of experience in financial technology journalism, including editorial roles at Bank Systems & Technology and Wall Street & Technology, and content creation for enterprise clients like Tata Consultancy Services. Ivan holds an MBA in Finance and Accounting from Vanderbilt University, along with degrees from Carnegie Mellon and Harvard Extension School.\n\n**Personal context**\n\nIvan lives in Seattle with his partner Naomi, who works at Sound Transit. He's actively engaged in cooking and baking classes (Monday baking, Tuesday cooking), follows Mediterranean diet principles, and maintains a sophisticated weekly meal planning system centered around the New York Times recipe column. Ivan has a strong preference for systematic approaches and building custom solutions over vendor dependencies, demonstrated in his choice of tools like GnuCash for accounting and his \"out-of-order test\" philosophy for maintaining systems without AI assistance.\n\n**Top of mind**\n\nIvan is executing a \"#SeptemberShowcase\" LinkedIn campaign to demonstrate his Convention City Seattle platform's rapid tourism content creation capabilities to destination marketing organizations. He's preparing for multiple speaking engagements, including a PuPPy (Python) meetup talk titled \"Test-Driven Development in the AI Era: When Goats Meet Robots\" and a CFO Leadership Council panel on AI ethics in finance. His QR Cards platform now serves multiple live Seattle neighborhood trails (Melrose Loop, Pike-Pine Waterfront, Seattle Center to Queen Anne, South Lake Union) with sophisticated backend infrastructure including CLI tools and custom analytics. Ivan recently created his professional landing page at taelyen.com positioning himself as providing \"Financial Technology Intelligence for Executive Decision-Makers\" to qualify for CFO Leadership Council membership.\n\n**Brief history**\n\n*Recent months*\n\nIvan has been systematically building Convention City Seattle as a tourism platform connecting convention visitors with local businesses through QR-coded trail guides. He developed what he calls the \"Mullet Method\" for AI-assisted development - using AI to build systems but running them on deterministic business logic. His platform demonstrates impressive technical capabilities with 171K+ lines of production code, comprehensive testing infrastructure, and multi-domain deployment capabilities costing just $3/month per subdomain. Ivan has been exploring business model pivots from targeting convention organizers to focusing on destination marketing organizations and venue partnerships, recognizing the potential for $25K-50K annual contracts. He's also been developing his \"spawn-solutions\" consulting methodology and systematic decision-making frameworks, positioning himself as someone who shows \"what AI can actually do\" rather than promoting AI hype.\n\n*Earlier context*\n\nIvan completed extensive sourdough bread science learning in his baking class, successfully improving his technique through systematic understanding of fermentation biology and extending bulk fermentation times. He worked through complex housing decisions involving potentially converting his Seattle condo to rental property while moving to Queen Anne, ultimately deciding against it after thorough financial analysis. Ivan has been developing sophisticated AI development methodologies, including his enhanced TDD approach with \"Red-Green-Black-Refactor\" cycles where \"Black\" represents mutation testing to verify test effectiveness. He's been building relationships in Seattle's business community, particularly through the CFO Leadership Council, and developing his thought leadership around ethical AI deployment in finance organizations.\n\n*Long-term background*\n\nIvan has deep expertise in financial technology from his journalism career, having covered fintech innovation for major consulting firms and enterprise clients. He holds advanced degrees from prestigious institutions and has experience in both technical writing and hands-on development. His background includes work at Seattle Convention Center, which informs his current tourism platform development. Ivan has consistently demonstrated preference for systematic, methodical approaches to complex problems, whether in software development, business strategy, or personal decision-making. He maintains strong academic connections, particularly with Harvard Extension School, and has experience in literary criticism and cross-cultural analysis that informs his systematic thinking approach.", "project_memories": {"01989bae-caa8-7197-a064-49d02d02c8da": "**Purpose & context**\n\nIvan is building QR Cards, a database-driven routing platform that creates QR code experiences across multiple verticals, with a primary focus on solving the \"yo-yo problem\" in tourism - where convention visitors stay trapped between hotels and convention centers instead of discovering local businesses. His vision centers on creating human-curated recommendation networks that help visitors circulate through neighborhoods while supporting pedestrian infrastructure improvements. The platform operates under Convention City Seattle, positioning it as an active Seattle project rather than just a solo developer concept.\n\nIvan's approach emphasizes authentic, battle-tested recommendations from people who've actually experienced places, moving away from crowd-sourced directories toward business-to-business recommendation networks with self-reinforcing quality control. The broader vision positions QR Cards as free DIY infrastructure for communities to create their own discovery maps, with revenue generated through anonymized analytics sold to cities, tourism boards, and researchers needing urban planning data.\n\nThe project connects to Ivan's Model Citizen Developer initiative, aimed at teaching others to build civic technology using AI agents without traditional programming backgrounds, democratizing software creation for civic purposes through workshops, open source curriculum, and partnerships with libraries and community organizations.\n\n**Current state**\n\nIvan has achieved enterprise-ready platform status with significant technical milestones including migration from Power Platform to Flask, development of a comprehensive CMS, and validation across multiple vertical markets. He has working physical materials including Melrose Loop printed cards and Convention City Seattle business cards, strengthening his positioning from concept to active project.\n\nHe's actively pursuing strategic opportunities including a mayoral candidate event with Katie Wilson focused on small business topics, and has an upcoming call with a Seattle Office of Economic Development consultant connected to infrastructure and planning relationships. Ivan is also preparing an AI Tinkerers presentation to demonstrate his spawn-experiments approach and AI agent orchestration methodology.\n\n**Key learnings & principles**\n\nIvan has developed innovative methodologies including Retest Driven Development (RDD) and specialist AI agent architecture that enabled rapid platform development. He's identified that the superior business model uses tent cards for business check-ins where every destination curates its own recommendation lists, creating authentic networks rather than relying on directory-based approaches.\n\nA critical insight emerged around the Craigslist ethos - radically simple, user-generated, anti-corporate approach - as potentially category-winning for experience sharing. Ivan recognizes that as a solo practitioner in pre-revenue stage, his biggest risk isn't technical failure but running out of time and money before reaching revenue, requiring survival-oriented rather than capital-intensive strategies.\n\n**Approach & patterns**\n\nIvan operates as a solo practitioner using AI agent orchestration to achieve rapid development cycles. His \"spawn-experiments\" approach allows for quick prototyping and iteration. He emphasizes building working products and physical materials to strengthen credibility and positioning in strategic conversations.\n\nHis business development approach focuses on low-risk strategic bets that provide value regardless of specific outcomes - like building custom campaign tools that create reusable content for Convention City Seattle whether electoral campaigns succeed or not.\n\n**Tools & resources**\n\nIvan has developed the QR Cards platform using Flask architecture with database-driven routing for semantic flexibility. He leverages AI agents extensively for development and has created specialist AI agent architecture for different aspects of the platform. Physical materials include printed cards and business cards for Convention City Seattle, providing tangible demonstration tools for strategic conversations.", "01982b4c-a4fe-75ae-a2bc-801d56e5d1c9": "**Purpose & context**\n\nIvan is a \"Model Citizen Developer\" building Convention City Seattle, a QR Cards platform that connects convention visitors with local Seattle businesses through tokenized, frictionless digital experiences. His mission centers on democratizing technology creation - empowering everyday people to build enterprise-grade systems using accessible AI-assisted development methodologies. With an MBA from Vanderbilt, degrees from Carnegie Mellon and Harvard Extension, and two decades in financial technology writing (including work for major firms like TCS, SWIFT, and EY), Ivan bridges business strategy with technical implementation.\n\nThe work serves dual purposes: Convention City Seattle addresses the economic disconnect between thriving convention attendance and struggling local businesses, while demonstrating systematic AI development approaches that non-traditional developers can use to build production systems. Ivan's background includes hands-on experience as Seattle Convention Center Guest Services Lead, providing authentic local expertise for tourism content creation. His target customers include Destination Marketing Organizations, convention centers like Seattle Convention Center (with CEO Jennifer LeMaster as a key contact), and the broader developer community seeking proven AI methodologies.\n\n**Current state**\n\nIvan is executing a systematic September Showcase campaign, creating daily Seattle tourism content to demonstrate rapid deployment capabilities to DMO decision-makers. He's successfully deployed multiple trail experiences including the Melrose Loop and Pike-Pine Waterfront, generating strong engagement metrics with return visitor rates above industry averages. His platform now serves multiple domains from a single Flask-based architecture, including Convention City Seattle, his personal portfolio (ivantohelpyou.com), and Model Citizen Developer newsletter archive.\n\nThe technical foundation is substantial: over 400,000 lines of production Python code with comprehensive test coverage, built using his systematic \"Mullet Method\" (business rules up front, AI assistance in the back). Ivan is preparing for speaking engagements including presentations at Puget Sound Python meetups and AI Tinkerers, where he'll share methodology research showing dramatic improvements in code quality through systematic approaches versus unconstrained AI development.\n\n**On the horizon**\n\nOctober represents a key transition point toward revenue generation, with Ivan planning sales conversations with DMOs and convention centers after completing his September showcase.
