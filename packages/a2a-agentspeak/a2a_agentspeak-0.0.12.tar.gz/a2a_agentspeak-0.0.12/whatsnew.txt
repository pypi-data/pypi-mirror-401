v 0.0.12
* Based on a2a-acl v0.0.12.
* Streaming task updates for sender when receiving an achieve message.
  Thus the client is aware of failures in agent behavior.
  See the new action .send_str_cb .
* New illocution 'upload' to allow transfer of data without parsing by the firewall.
  See the llm_refactoring example.


v 0.0.11
* Tested with a2a-acl v0.0.11.

v 0.0.10
* Interfaces (in *.asi files) use illocutions (tell, ask, achieve, propose) to declare skills instead of old keywords (input, belief, action).
* New internal action .is_alive to check is an A2A agent is online. See test in directory tests/is_alive.
* Two internal actions to send strings : .send_str (without callback) and .send_str_cb (with a callback).
