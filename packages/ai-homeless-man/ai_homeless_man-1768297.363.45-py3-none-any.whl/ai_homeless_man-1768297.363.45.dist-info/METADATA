# ai-homeless-man

A Python library for quickly generating and manipulating AI-driven homeless person simulations, designed for educational and demonstrative purposes. This package provides a simplified interface for exploring and understanding the capabilities of AI in generating realistic-looking but ultimately artificial content.

## Installation

You can install `ai-homeless-man` using pip:
bash
pip install ai-homeless-man

## Basic Usage

Here are a few examples of how to use the `ai-homeless-man` library:

**1. Generating a Basic Simulation:**
python
from ai_homeless_man import HomelessManSimulator

simulator = HomelessManSimulator()
simulation_result = simulator.generate_simulation()

print(simulation_result) # Outputs a basic simulation of a homeless individual's interaction.

This example demonstrates the most basic use case: generating a default simulation. The `generate_simulation()` function provides a textual representation of a simulated homeless person scenario.

**2. Customizing the Simulation with Parameters:**
python
from ai_homeless_man import HomelessManSimulator

simulator = HomelessManSimulator()
simulation_result = simulator.generate_simulation(emotion="sad", location="urban park", request="spare change")

print(simulation_result) # Outputs a simulation with specified emotion, location, and request.

This example shows how to customize the simulation by providing specific parameters like emotion, location, and the request made by the simulated individual. This allows for more targeted and nuanced simulations.

**3. Analyzing Simulation Data:**
python
from ai_homeless_man import HomelessManSimulator

simulator = HomelessManSimulator()
simulation_data = simulator.analyze_simulation(simulation_result)

print(simulation_data) # Outputs an analysis of the simulation result, providing insights into the AI's decision-making.

This example demonstrates how to analyze the generated simulation data. The `analyze_simulation()` function returns a structured representation of the simulation, allowing you to understand the underlying factors contributing to the simulation's outcome.

**4. Creating a Series of Simulations:**
python
from ai_homeless_man import HomelessManSimulator

simulator = HomelessManSimulator()
for i in range(3):
    simulation_result = simulator.generate_simulation(location=f"location {i+1}")
    print(f"Simulation {i+1}: {simulation_result}")

This code snippet illustrates how to generate a series of simulations with varying locations. This can be useful for comparative analysis or for creating a more comprehensive understanding of the AI's capabilities across different environments.

**5. Saving Simulation Results to a File:**
python
from ai_homeless_man import HomelessManSimulator

simulator = HomelessManSimulator()
simulation_result = simulator.generate_simulation()

with open("simulation_output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(simulation_result)

print("Simulation saved to simulation_output.txt")

This demonstrates how to save the generated simulation result to a text file for later review or further processing. This is particularly useful for long or complex simulations.

## Feature List

*   **Simulation Generation:** Generates textual simulations of interactions involving a simulated homeless person.
*   **Customizable Parameters:** Allows users to specify parameters such as emotion, location, and request to influence the simulation's outcome.
