Changelog
=========

2.0.11 (2026-01-10)
-------------------
- | Now about() and about_from_setup() return an instance of the 'adict'
  | dictionary with about info (but backward compatibility is preserved).
- | Now the __version_info__ field has a 'version_info' namedtuple type
  | instead of a class (but backward compatibility is preserved).
- | Workaround for a tox error that occurs when pyproject.toml and setup.cfg
  | files coexist.
- Improved parsing for newer metadata specifications.
- | Fixed a bug concerning the 'strict' parameter for the methods
  | email.utils.getaddresses() and email.utils.parseaddr().
