def GDM_SOScorr_dens(rho, tau, c_cal, c_gas, K=2.1e4):
    '''
    Speed of sound density correction. The correction is performed to take into account the difference in properties between the calibration gas and the actual process gas.
    The correction factor is given by equation E7 in the Installation and Maintenance Manual for Micro Motion 7812 (P/N MMI-20018377, Rev. AC April 2012) [1_]. 
    The equation originates from "Velocity of Sound Effect on Gas Density Transducers - The theory, measurement results and methods of correction", by Stansfeld, J W (NSFMW 1986) [2_].
    The same equation is also available in ISO 15970:2014 [3_], at a slighly different format. 

    Parameters
    ----------
    rho : float
        Measured density from GDM, corrected for temperature [kg/m3].
    tau : float
        Measured instrument time period [μs].
    c_cal : float
        Speed of sound of calibration gas [m/s]
        The conditions of this values are not specified in the manual, however, after checking with both Micro Motion and Kiwa, and they both say that they believe the following:
        The speed of sound of the calibration gas should be given at the same density condition (or time period) as during calibration, according to ISO 15970 [3_].
    c_gas : float
        Speed of sound of measured gas [m/s] at measured conditions (also confirmed by vendor).
    K : float, optional
        Speed of sound constant for density sensor. The default is 2.1e4 for both the Micro Motion 7812 and the GDM (also confirmed by vendor)

    Returns
    -------
    rho_vos : float
        Measured density from GDM, corrected for speed of sound [kg/m3]

    Notes
    -----
    There are sometimes confusion about the conditions to be used for the speed of sound of the calibration gas, as this is not explicitly stated in the manual, the ISO, nor the original paper by Stansfeld.
    But from the derivation of the equation, it can be inferred that the speed of sound should be given at the same conditions as the corresponding density (or time period) during calibration.
    For example, if a meter (calibrated on nitrogen at 20 °C) measures a gas density (when installed in the process) of 75 kg/m3 (657 μs), the speed of sound of the calibration gas (c_cal) used in the calculation
    should be the speed of sound of nitrogen at 20 °C and 75 kg/m3, independent of the pressure and temperature of the process gas.
