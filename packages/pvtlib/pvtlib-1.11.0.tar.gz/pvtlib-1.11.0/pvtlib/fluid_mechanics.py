def critical_velocity_for_uniform_wio_dispersion_horizontal(ST_oil_aq, rho_o, rho_aq, Visc_o, D, K1=2.02, G=10):
    '''
    Calculate critical (minimum) velocity for maintaining a dispersion degree G, based on NFOGM HANDBOOK of Water Fraction Metering [1_].
    
    The value G = 10 gives a concentration ratio 0.9, and is recommended by ISO 3171. This corresponds to ±5 % deviation from the mean concentration and it is in
    practise considered as a homogeneous mixture.
    
    The numerical constant K1 depends on the unit system being used, and the default K1 corresponds to SI units, which is being used in this function.
    The function will also work for field SI units (K1 = 0.5), but the units will no longer be valid. 
    
    The method described here should be used with care since it is based on a simplified
    concentration model, as well as other simplified and semi-theoretical models. The
    water concentration model is only valid for small water volume fractions, i.e. less
    than approximately 10–15 % water in oil.

'''
Equations for convering between volume percent and mass percent in a two-phase system and for correcting a mixed density for the presence of a contaminant
The following calculations assumes a mixture of two immiscible liquids with a known density for each phase. If used for a fluid flow scenario, it also assumes no slip between the phases. 
i.e.    rho_mix = rho_A * alpha_A + rho_B * alpha_B
These equations are typically useful in "oil-in-water" and "water-in-oil" systems. 

Nomenclature:
    Dominant phase - The continuous phase, e.g for normal operation the oil phase is the Dominant phase (continous phase) in an oil metering station.
    Contaminant phase - The disperse phase, e.g for normal operation any water present in an oil metering station is the Contaminant(disperse phase) in that oil metering station.
