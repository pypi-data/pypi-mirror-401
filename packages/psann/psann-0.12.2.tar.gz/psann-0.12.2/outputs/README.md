# outputs/

This directory is for **local, generated outputs** (quick experiments, environment reports, scratch artifacts).

- This folder is **ignored by git** (except this README).
- Prefer creating subfolders with a timestamp or descriptive slug, e.g. `outputs/gpu_tests/20260115_120000_run1/`.
- For larger benchmark runs, use `reports/` instead.
