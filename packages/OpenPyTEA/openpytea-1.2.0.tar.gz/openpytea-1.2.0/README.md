# 🧩 OpenPyTEA

**OpenPyTEA** is an open-source Python toolkit for performing **techno-economic assessment (TEA)** of chemical and energy systems. It was created to address a persistent gap in the TEA workflow: while process simulators model mass and energy balances, researchers often lack an equally transparent and flexible way to evaluate the **economic feasibility** of their designs. Commercial tools remain *black-box tools*, and many academic TEA implementations are process-specific, undocumented, or difficult to reproduce.

**OpenPyTEA** provides a fully open, modular, and traceable framework that brings TEA into the Python ecosystem. By integrating **equipment cost estimation**, **capital and operating expenditure modeling**, **cash-flow analysis**, **cost breakdown plots**, **sensitivity evaluation**, and **Monte Carlo uncertainty propagation**, the toolkit enables users to perform end-to-end TEA with clarity and reproducibility.

Beyond its functionality, **OpenPyTEA is designed as a community-driven TEA platform**. Users can contribute new equipment cost correlations, improve economic models, report issues, and expand the toolkit’s capabilities over time. This collaborative approach helps build a shared, transparent, and continually improving TEA resource—similar to the open-source progress seen in the LCA community.

Whether used for early-stage process design, technology screening, or teaching, **OpenPyTEA** makes TEA more accessible, consistent, and aligned with FAIR research principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable).

## ✨ Key Features
- **Modular architecture:** clean separation of cost correlations, equipment objects, plant economics, and uncertainty analysis.  
- **Transparent and reproducible:** all algorithms, equations, and assumptions are openly available for full traceability.
- **Cost breakdown visualization:** built-in helpers to plot stacked bar charts of direct equipment costs, fixed capital, and operating costs.
- **Built-in uncertainty tools:** automatic generation of sensitivity plots and Monte Carlo simulations.  
- **Interoperable and extensible:** easy integration with process simulators, optimization frameworks, and LCA tools.  
- **Education-friendly:** ideal for teaching TEA and process design without reliance on proprietary software.  
- **Community-driven:** users can contribute new correlations, improve models, request features, and shape the evolution of the platform.

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### 1. **Equipment-level costing**

Each process unit (e.g., compressor, heat exchanger, reactor) is represented by an `Equipment` object:

```python
from openpytea.equipment import Equipment

compressor = Equipment(
    name='COMP',
    param=5000,  # kW
    category='Compressors, fans, & Blowers',
    type='Compressor, centrifugal',
    material='Carbon steel'
)

print(compressor.direct_cost)
```

Each equipment item retrieves its cost correlation from the internal database in `data/cost_correlations.csv` and adjusts the cost to the desired year using the Chemical Engineering Plant Cost Index (CEPCI).

### 2. **Plant-level techno-economic assessment**

Multiple equipment objects can be grouped into a `Plant` instance for full TEA

```python
from openpytea.plant import Plant

ammonia_plant = Plant({
    'name':'Ammonia Production Plant', 
    'country':'Netherlands',
    'process_type':'Fluids', 
    'equipment'=[compressor],
    'interest_rate':0.09, 
    'plant_utilization':0.95, 
    'project_lifetime':20,  # in years
    'plant_products': {  # Here we define the product(s) of the plant
        'ammonia': {
            'production':125_000, # Daily production in kg/day,
        }
    },
    'variable_opex_inputs':{
        'electricity':{
            'consumption': 110,  # Daily consumption, in MWh 
            'price': 75  # US$/MWh
        },
        'hydrogen':{
            'consumption': 22_000,  # Daily consumption, in kg/day
            'price': 2  # US$/kg
        },
    },
})

plant.calculate_cash_flow(print_results=True)
plant.calculate_levelized_cost()
```
Main outputs include:
- Capital expenditures (CAPEX): inside/outside battery limits, engineering, contingency, and location factors
- Operating expenditures (OPEX): variable and operating expenditures, including utilities, maintenance, labor, and overhead costs
- Financial metrics: Net Present Value (NPV), Internal Rate of Return (IRR), Return on Investment (ROI), Payback Time (PBT), and Levelized Cost of Product (LCOP)

### 3. **CAPEX and OPEX breakdown plots**

OpenPyTEA includes convenience functions for visualizing the economic structure of a process plant using stacked bar plots:

- `plot_direct_costs_bar(plant)`: direct equipment costs (per equipment item).  
- `plot_fixed_capital_bar(plant)`: fixed capital components (ISBL, OSBL, design & engineering, contingency).  
- `plot_variable_opex_bar(plant)`: variable operating costs by input mass and energy stream.  
- `plot_fixed_opex_bar(plant)`: fixed operating expenses, including labor, supervision, maintenance, overhead, R&D, and more.

These plots provide a quick visual breakdown of the main CAPEX and OPEX contributors in a flowsheet.

### 4. **Sensitivity and uncertainty analysis**

**OpenPyTEA** provides integrated tools for visual sensitivity and probabilistic analysis of cost and performance drivers.

One-Way Sensitivity Line Plot
```python
from openpytea.analysis import sensitivity_plot

results = sensitivity_plot(
    plant, 
    parameter="electricity", 
    plus_minus_value =0.5
    )
```
The `plant` input may also be a list of `Plant` objects to generate comparison plots.

Tornado Plot (One-at-a-Time Sensitivity)
```python
from openpytea.analysis import tornado_plot

tornado_plot(
    plant,
    plus_minus_value = 0.5,
)
```

Monte Carlo Simulation
```python
from openpytea.analysis import monte_carlo

results = monte_carlo(
    plant,
    num_samples=1_000_000
)

```
Outputs include probability distributions and confidence intervals for LCOP or NPV—supporting uncertainty-informed decision-making. With `plot_multiple_monte_carlo`, **OpenPyTEA** can also visualize Monte Carlo results for multiple plants to enable uncertainty comparisons.
