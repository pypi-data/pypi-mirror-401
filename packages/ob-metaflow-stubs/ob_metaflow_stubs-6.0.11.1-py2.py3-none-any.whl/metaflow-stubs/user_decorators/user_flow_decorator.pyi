    Derive from this class to implement a flow mutator.
    
    A flow mutator allows you to introspect a flow and its included steps. You can
    then add parameters, configurations and decorators to the flow as well as modify
    any of its steps.
    use values available through configurations to determine how to mutate the flow.
    
    There are two main methods provided:
      - pre_mutate: called as early as possible right after configuration values are read.
      - mutate: called right after all the command line is parsed but before any
        Metaflow decorators are applied.
    
    The `mutate` method does not allow you to modify the flow itself but you can still
    modify the steps.

        Method called right before the first Metaflow step decorator is applied. This
        means that the command line, including all `--with` options has been parsed.
        
        Given how late this function is called, there are a few restrictions on what
        you can do; the following methods on MutableFlow are not allowed and calling
        them will result in an error:
          - add_parameter/remove_parameter
