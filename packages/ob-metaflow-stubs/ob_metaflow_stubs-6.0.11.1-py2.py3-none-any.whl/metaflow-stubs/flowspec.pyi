        Helper function for merging artifacts in a join step.
        
        This function takes all the artifacts coming from the branches of a
        join point and assigns them to self in the calling step. Only artifacts
        not set in the current step are considered. If, for a given artifact, different
        values are present on the incoming edges, an error will be thrown and the artifacts
        that conflict will be reported.
        
        As a few examples, in the simple graph: A splitting into B and C and joining in D:
        ```
        A:
          self.x = 5
          self.y = 6
        B:
          self.b_var = 1

        D:

        In D, the following artifacts are set:
          - `y` (value: 6), `b_var` (value: 1)
          - if `from_b` and `from_c` are the same, `x` will be accessible and have value `from_b`
          - if `from_b` and `from_c` are different, an error will be thrown. To prevent this error,
            you need to manually set `self.x` in D to a merged value (for example the max) prior to
            calling `merge_artifacts`.

        ----------
        inputs : Inputs
            Incoming steps to the join point.
        exclude : List[str], optional, default None
            If specified, do not consider merging artifacts with a name in `exclude`.
            Cannot specify if `include` is also specified.
        include : List[str], optional, default None
            If specified, only merge artifacts specified. Cannot specify if `exclude` is
            also specified.

        ------
        MetaflowException
            This exception is thrown if this is not called in a join step.

            This exception is thrown in case of unresolved conflicts.
        MissingInMergeArtifactsException

        Indicates the next step to execute after this step has completed.
        
        This statement should appear as the last statement of each step, except
        the end step.
        
        There are several valid formats to specify the next step:
        
        - Straight-line connection: `self.next(self.next_step)` where `next_step` is a method in
          the current class decorated with the `@step` decorator.
        
        - Static fan-out connection: `self.next(self.step1, self.step2, ...)` where `stepX` are
          methods in the current class decorated with the `@step` decorator.
        
        - Foreach branch:
          ```
          self.next(self.foreach_step, foreach='foreach_iterator')
          ```
          In this situation, `foreach_step` is a method in the current class decorated with the
          `@step` decorator and `foreach_iterator` is a variable name in the current class that
          evaluates to an iterator. A task will be launched for each value in the iterator and
          each task will execute the code specified by the step `foreach_step`.
        
        - Switch statement:
          ```
          self.next({"case1": self.step_a, "case2": self.step_b}, condition='condition_variable')
          ```
          In this situation, `step_a` and `step_b` are methods in the current class decorated
          with the `@step` decorator and `condition_variable` is a variable name in the current
          class. The value of the condition variable determines which step to execute. If the
          value doesn't match any of the dictionary keys, a RuntimeError is raised.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        dsts : Callable[..., None]
            One or more methods annotated with `@step`.
        
        Raises
        ------
        InvalidNextException
            Raised if the format of the arguments does not match one of the ones given above.
