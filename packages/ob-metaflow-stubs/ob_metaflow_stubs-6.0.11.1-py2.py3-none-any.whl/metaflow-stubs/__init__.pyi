    """
    Set up an S3 proxy that caches objects in an external, S3‑compatible bucket
    for S3 read and write requests.
    
    This decorator requires an integration in the Outerbounds platform that
    points to an external bucket. It affects S3 operations performed via
    Metaflow's `get_aws_client` and `S3` within a `@step`.
    
    Read operations
    ---------------
    All read operations pass through the proxy. If an object does not already
    exist in the external bucket, it is cached there. For example, if code reads
    from buckets `FOO` and `BAR` using the `S3` interface, objects from both
    buckets are cached in the external bucket.
    
    During task execution, all S3‑related read requests are routed through the
    proxy:
        - If the object is present in the external object store, the proxy
          streams it directly from there without accessing the requested origin
          bucket.
        - If the object is not present in the external storage, the proxy
          fetches it from the requested bucket, caches it in the external
          storage, and streams the response from the origin bucket.
    
    Warning
    -------
    All READ operations (e.g., GetObject, HeadObject) pass through the external
    bucket regardless of the bucket specified in user code. Even
    `S3(run=self)` and `S3(s3root="mybucketfoo")` requests go through the
    external bucket cache.
    
    Write operations
    ----------------
    Write behavior is controlled by the `write_mode` parameter, which determines
    whether writes also persist objects in the cache.
    
    `write_mode` values:
        - `origin-and-cache`: objects are written both to the cache and to their
          intended origin bucket.
        - `origin`: objects are written only to their intended origin bucket.
    
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    integration_name : str, optional
        [Outerbounds integration name](https://docs.outerbounds.com/outerbounds/configuring-secrets/#integrations-view)
        that holds the configuration for the external, S3‑compatible object
        storage bucket. If not specified, the only available S3 proxy
        integration in the namespace is used (fails if multiple exist).
    write_mode : str, optional
        Controls whether writes also go to the external bucket.
            - `origin` (default)
            - `origin-and-cache`
    debug : bool, optional
        Enables debug logging for proxy operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    temp_dir_root : str, optional
        The root directory that will hold the temporary directory where objects will be downloaded.
    
    cache_scope : str, optional
        The scope of the cache. Can be `checkpoint` / `flow` / `global`.
            - `checkpoint` (default): All repos are stored like objects saved by `@checkpoint`.
                i.e., the cached path is derived from the namespace, flow, step, and Metaflow foreach iteration.
                Any repo downloaded under this scope will only be retrieved from the cache when the step runs under the same namespace in the same flow (at the same foreach index).
    
            - `flow`: All repos are cached under the flow, regardless of namespace.
                i.e., the cached path is derived solely from the flow name.
                When to use this mode: (1) Multiple users are executing the same flow and want shared access to the repos cached by the decorator. (2) Multiple versions of a flow are deployed, all needing access to the same repos cached by the decorator.
    
            - `global`: All repos are cached under a globally static path.
                i.e., the base path of the cache is static and all repos are stored under it.
                When to use this mode:
                    - All repos from the Hugging Face Hub need to be shared by users across all flow executions.
            - Each caching scope comes with its own trade-offs:
                - `checkpoint`:
                    - Has explicit control over when caches are populated (controlled by the same flow that has the `@huggingface_hub` decorator) but ends up hitting the Hugging Face Hub more often if there are many users/namespaces/steps.
                    - Since objects are written on a `namespace/flow/step` basis, the blast radius of a bad checkpoint is limited to a particular flow in a namespace.
                - `flow`:
                    - Has less control over when caches are populated (can be written by any execution instance of a flow from any namespace) but results in more cache hits.
                    - The blast radius of a bad checkpoint is limited to all runs of a particular flow.
                    - It doesn't promote cache reuse across flows.
                - `global`:
                    - Has no control over when caches are populated (can be written by any flow execution) but has the highest cache hit rate.
                    - It promotes cache reuse across flows.
                    - The blast radius of a bad checkpoint spans every flow that could be using a particular repo.
    
    load: Union[List[str], List[Tuple[Dict, str]], List[Tuple[str, str]], List[Dict], None]
        The list of repos (models/datasets) to load.
    
        Loaded repos can be accessed via `current.huggingface_hub.loaded`. If load is set, then the following happens:
    
        - If repo (model/dataset) is not found in the datastore:
            - Downloads the repo from Hugging Face Hub to a temporary directory (or uses specified path) for local access
            - Stores it in Metaflow's datastore (s3/gcs/azure etc.) with a unique name based on repo_type/repo_id
                - All HF models loaded for a `@step` will be cached separately under flow/step/namespace.
    
        - If repo is found in the datastore:
            - Loads it directly from datastore to local path (can be temporary directory or specified path)

    """
    `@nebius_s3_proxy` is a Nebius-specific S3 Proxy decorator for routing S3 requests through a local proxy service.
    It exists to make it easier for users to know that this decorator should only be used with
    a Neo Cloud like Nebius. The underlying mechanics of the decorator is the same as the `@s3_proxy`:
    
    
    Set up an S3 proxy that caches objects in an external, S3‑compatible bucket
    for S3 read and write requests.
    
    This decorator requires an integration in the Outerbounds platform that
    points to an external bucket. It affects S3 operations performed via
    Metaflow's `get_aws_client` and `S3` within a `@step`.
    
    Read operations
    ---------------
    All read operations pass through the proxy. If an object does not already
    exist in the external bucket, it is cached there. For example, if code reads
    from buckets `FOO` and `BAR` using the `S3` interface, objects from both
    buckets are cached in the external bucket.
    
    During task execution, all S3‑related read requests are routed through the
    proxy:
        - If the object is present in the external object store, the proxy
          streams it directly from there without accessing the requested origin
          bucket.
        - If the object is not present in the external storage, the proxy
          fetches it from the requested bucket, caches it in the external
          storage, and streams the response from the origin bucket.
    
    Warning
    -------
    All READ operations (e.g., GetObject, HeadObject) pass through the external
    bucket regardless of the bucket specified in user code. Even
    `S3(run=self)` and `S3(s3root="mybucketfoo")` requests go through the
    external bucket cache.
    
    Write operations
    ----------------
    Write behavior is controlled by the `write_mode` parameter, which determines
    whether writes also persist objects in the cache.
    
    `write_mode` values:
        - `origin-and-cache`: objects are written both to the cache and to their
          intended origin bucket.
        - `origin`: objects are written only to their intended origin bucket.
    
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    integration_name : str, optional
        [Outerbounds integration name](https://docs.outerbounds.com/outerbounds/configuring-secrets/#integrations-view)
        that holds the configuration for the external, S3‑compatible object
        storage bucket. If not specified, the only available S3 proxy
        integration in the namespace is used (fails if multiple exist).
    write_mode : str, optional
        Controls whether writes also go to the external bucket.
            - `origin` (default)
            - `origin-and-cache`
    debug : bool, optional
        Enables debug logging for proxy operations.

        If a list of tuples is provided, the first element is the artifact name and the second element is the path the artifact needs be unpacked on
        the local filesystem. If the second element is None, the artifact will be unpacked in the current working directory.
        If a string is provided, then the artifact corresponding to that name will be loaded in the current working directory.
    
    temp_dir_root : str, default: None
        The root directory under which `current.model.loaded` will store loaded models

    Allows setting external datastores to save data for the
    `@checkpoint`/`@model`/`@huggingface_hub` decorators.
    
    This decorator is useful when users wish to save data to a different datastore
    than what is configured in Metaflow. This can be for variety of reasons:
    
    1. Data security: The objects needs to be stored in a bucket (object storage) that is not accessible by other flows.
    2. Data Locality: The location where the task is executing is not located in the same region as the datastore.
        - Example: Metaflow datastore lives in US East, but the task is executing in Finland datacenters.
    3. Data Lifecycle Policies: The objects need to be archived / managed separately from the Metaflow managed objects.
        - Example: Flow is training very large models that need to be stored separately and will be deleted more aggressively than the Metaflow managed objects.
    
    Usage:
    ----------
    
    - Using a custom IAM role to access the datastore.
    
        ```python
        @with_artifact_store(
            type="s3",
            config=lambda: {
                "root": "s3://my-bucket-foo/path/to/root",
                "role_arn": ROLE,
            },
        )
        class MyFlow(FlowSpec):
    
            @checkpoint
            @step
            def start(self):
                with open("my_file.txt", "w") as f:
                    f.write("Hello, World!")
                self.external_bucket_checkpoint = current.checkpoint.save("my_file.txt")
                self.next(self.end)
    
        ```
    
    - Using credentials to access the s3-compatible datastore.
    
        ```python
        @with_artifact_store(
            type="s3",
            config=lambda: {

                },
            },
        )
        class MyFlow(FlowSpec):
    
            @checkpoint
            @step
            def start(self):
                with open("my_file.txt", "w") as f:
                    f.write("Hello, World!")
                self.external_bucket_checkpoint = current.checkpoint.save("my_file.txt")
                self.next(self.end)
    
        ```
    
    - Accessing objects stored in external datastores after task execution.
    
        ```python
        run = Run("CheckpointsTestsFlow/8992")
        with artifact_store_from(run=run, config={

    Parameters
    ----------
    timeout : int
        Time, in seconds before the task times out and fails. (Default: 3600)
    poke_interval : int
        Time in seconds that the job should wait in between each try. (Default: 60)
    mode : str
        How the sensor operates. Options are: { poke | reschedule }. (Default: "poke")
    exponential_backoff : bool
        allow progressive longer waits between pokes by using exponential backoff algorithm. (Default: True)
    pool : str
        the slot pool this task should run in,
        slot pools are a way to limit concurrency for certain tasks. (Default:None)
    soft_fail : bool
        Set to true to mark the task as SKIPPED on failure. (Default: False)
    name : str
        Name of the sensor on Airflow
    description : str
        Description of sensor in the Airflow UI
    bucket_key : Union[str, List[str]]
        The key(s) being waited on. Supports full s3:// style url or relative path from root level.
        When it's specified as a full s3:// url, please leave `bucket_name` as None
    bucket_name : str
        Name of the S3 bucket. Only needed when bucket_key is not provided as a full s3:// url.
        When specified, all the keys passed to bucket_key refers to this bucket. (Default:None)
    wildcard_match : bool
        whether the bucket_key should be interpreted as a Unix wildcard pattern. (Default: False)
    aws_conn_id : str
        a reference to the s3 connection on Airflow. (Default: None)
    verify : bool
        Whether or not to verify SSL certificates for S3 connection. (Default: None)
