class DEPLOYMENT_READY_CONDITIONS(object, metaclass=type):
    """
    Deployment ready conditions define what is considered a successful completion of the current deployment instance.
    This allows users or platform designers to configure the criteria for deployment readiness.
    
    Why do we need deployment readiness conditions?
        - Deployments might be taking place from a CI/CD-esque environment, In these setups, the downstream build triggers might be depending on a specific criteria for deployment completion. Having readiness conditions allows the CI/CD systems to get a signal of when the deployment is ready.
    - Users might be calling the deployment API under different conditions:
        - Some users might want a cluster of workers ready before serving traffic while others might want just one worker ready to start serving traffic.
    
    Some readiness conditions include:
            1) [at_least_one_running] At least min(min_replicas, 1) workers of the current deployment instance's version have started running.
        - Usecase: Some endpoints may be deployed ephemerally and are considered ready when at least one instance is running; additional instances are for load management.
        2) [all_running] At least min_replicas number of workers are running for the deployment to be considered ready.
        - Usecase: Operators may require that all replicas are available before traffic is routed. Needed when inference endpoints maybe under some SLA or require a larger load
        3) [fully_finished] At least min_replicas number of workers are running for the deployment and there are no pending or crashlooping workers from previous versions lying around.
        - Usecase: Ensuring endpoint is fully available and no other versions are running or endpoint has been fully scaled down.
    4) [async] The deployment will be assumed ready as soon as the server responds with a 200.
        - Usecase: Operators may only care that the URL is minted for the deployment or the deployment eventually scales down to 0.

        Check if the deployment readiness condition is satisfied based on current capsule and worker status.
        
        This method evaluates whether a deployment has reached its desired ready state according to
        the specified readiness condition. Different conditions have different criteria for what
        constitutes a "ready" deployment.
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        capsule_status : CapsuleStatus
            The current status of the capsule deployment, including update progress information.
        worker_semantic_status : CapsuleWorkerSemanticStatus
            Semantic status information about the workers, including counts and states.
        readiness_condition : str
            The readiness condition to evaluate. Must be one of the class constants:
            - ATLEAST_ONE_RUNNING: At least one worker is running and update is not in progress
            - ALL_RUNNING: All required workers are running and update is not in progress
            - FULLY_FINISHED: All workers running with no pending/crashlooping workers and update is not in progress
            - ASYNC: Deployment is ready as soon as the backend responds with a 200 on create and provides a API URL.
        
        Returns
        -------
        Tuple[bool, bool]
            A tuple containing:
            - First element: Boolean indicating if the readiness condition is satisfied
            - Second element: Boolean indicating if additional worker readiness checks
              should be performed (False for ASYNC mode, True for all others)
        
        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If an invalid readiness condition is provided.
