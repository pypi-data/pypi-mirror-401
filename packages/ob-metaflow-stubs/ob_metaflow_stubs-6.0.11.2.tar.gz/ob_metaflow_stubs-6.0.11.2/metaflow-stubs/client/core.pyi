    Parameters
    ----------
    ms : str

    the task to be present. Usually you want the latest attempt, which
    is what instantiating a `Task` object returns by default. If
    you need to e.g. retrieve logs from a failed attempt, you can
    explicitly get information about a specific attempt by using the
    following syntax when creating a task:
    
    `Task('flow/run/step/task', attempt=<attempt>)`
    
    where `attempt=0` corresponds to the first attempt etc.

    successful : bool
        True if the task completed successfully.

        Exception raised by this task if there was one.
