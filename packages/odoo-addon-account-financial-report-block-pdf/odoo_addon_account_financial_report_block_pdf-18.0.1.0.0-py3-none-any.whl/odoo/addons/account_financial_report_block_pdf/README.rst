have to be blocked.

Configuration
=============

To configure the list of financial reports that cannot be printed in PDF
you need to:

- Go to Settings > Technical > System Parameters.

- Find or create a system parameter called
  "forbidden.pdf.financial.reports".

- Introduce the technical name of the wizard generator models that need
  to be blocked separated by commas. The link between the financial
  reports in the module account_financial_report and the technical name
  of their wizards is as follows:

  - General Ledger: general.ledger.report.wizard
  - Journal Ledger: journal.ledger.report.wizard
  - Trial Balance: trial.balance.report.wizard
  - Open Items: open.items.report.wizard
  - Aged Partner Balance: aged.partner.balance.report.wizard
  - VAT Report: vat.report.wizard

For instance, if the PDF generation of the General Ledger and Trial
Balance reports have to be blocked, the
"forbidden.pdf.financial.reports" system parameter should contain the
value "general.ledger.report.wizard,trial.balance.report.wizard" (with
no quotes).

Keep in mind that all the PDF reports are blocked by default when this
module is installed.

If a new report that inherits the abstract class
account_financial_report_abstract_wizard is developed, its PDF report
can also be blocked by adding the name of its own wizard in the
"forbidden.pdf.financial.reports" system parameter list.

Usage
=====

When a user tries to generate the PDF file of a financial report whose
PDF file have been blocked, an error message appears.
