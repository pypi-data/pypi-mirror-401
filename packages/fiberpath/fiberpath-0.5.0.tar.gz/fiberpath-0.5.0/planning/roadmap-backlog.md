# FiberPath Roadmap - Future Backlog (Low Priority / Speculative)

**Focus:** Speculative features with unclear value or disproportionate complexity  
**Status:** Backlog - only implement with strong user demand and clear value proposition  
**Priority:** Low to None

---

## Category 1: Complex Visualization Features

### 3D Streaming Visualization

**Description:** Real-time 3D toolpath visualization during Marlin streaming using Three.js

**Why Rejected:**

- Current PNG preview + progress bar/log provides sufficient feedback
- "Eye candy" feature without functional value (32+ tasks for marginal benefit)
- Three.js adds ~600KB bundle size
- Poor complexity-to-value ratio

**If Reconsidered:** Would require Three.js integration, G-code parser, real-time rendering pipeline, performance optimization for large files. Only implement with explicit user demand and evidence current visualization is insufficient.

---

### WebGL-based Toolpath Rendering

**Description:** Hardware-accelerated toolpath rendering for Main tab visualization

**Why Low Priority:**

- Current PNG-based preview works fine
- Would require complete rewrite of visualization system
- Performance benefits unclear for typical use cases
- Users aren't complaining about current visualization speed

**Decision:** Not worth the effort unless performance becomes a real problem.

---

## Category 2: Internationalization

### Multi-language Support (i18n)

**Why Rejected:**

- No evidence of international user base
- G-code/winding terminology is inherently English
- High maintenance burden (500+ UI strings, native speaker translation quality)
- Would require i18next/react-intl setup, extraction workflow, ongoing maintenance

**Reconsider If:** Clear international user base, users requesting specific languages, volunteer translators available, commitment to long-term maintenance.

---

## Category 3: Advanced UX Features

### Dark Mode Theme Toggle

**Why Deferred:**

- Cosmetic feature without functional value
- Design token system exists (CSS variables) but full theme switching requires significant work
- Would need: theme context, storage persistence, theme-specific asset variants, testing across all components
- No user demand for this feature

**Reconsider If:** Multiple users request it, commitment to maintaining both themes long-term.

### Panel Resize Handles

**Why Rejected:**

- Attempted in previous development cycle, didn't work well
- Layout is already well-balanced for the workflow
- Complex implementation (drag handlers, state persistence, layout constraints)
- Low value for high complexity

### Keyboard Shortcut Customization

**Why Deferred:**

- Current shortcuts are well-designed and sufficient (Ctrl+S, Ctrl+O, Alt+1/2, etc.)
- Niche feature requested by power users only
- Would require: shortcut registry, conflict detection, UI for rebinding, storage persistence
- Most users never customize shortcuts

**Reconsider If:** Users report shortcut conflicts with other software, accessibility needs emerge.

### Workspace Layout Presets

**Why Deferred:**

- Premature optimization - current single layout works well
- Would require: layout serialization, preset storage, restore logic, UI for preset management
- Unclear use case - who needs multiple layouts?

**Reconsider If:** Clear use cases emerge (different layouts for different workflows).

### Undo/Redo System

**Why Deferred:**

- Complex implementation (command pattern, state snapshots, undo stack management)
- Current workflow is forward-only (add layers, export), undo rarely needed
- File save/load provides "undo" via reverting to saved state
- High maintenance burden for unclear benefit

**Reconsider If:** Users frequently request ability to undo layer changes or configuration updates.

### Layer Presets System

**Why Deferred:**

- Advanced feature with unclear use case
- Would require: preset schema, storage, UI for save/load/manage presets
- Current workflow (duplicate existing layers) is sufficient
- No evidence users need to save layer configurations

**Reconsider If:** Users request ability to reuse layer configurations across projects.

---

## Category 4: Advanced Data Features

### Coverage Analysis and Visualization

**Why Out of Scope:**

- Extremely complex (requires composite physics expertise, 3D engine)
- Academic research territory, not practical tool
- Users trust math without visualization and can export to specialized analysis tools

### Real-time G-code Preview

**Why Rejected:**

- Current plan→preview→export workflow is sufficient
- PNG preview already very fast
- Would require streaming generation architecture for unclear benefit

---

## Category 5: Integration Features

### REST API Enhancements

**Why Low Priority:**

- CLI and GUI sufficient for current users
- API exists but unused (no known integrations)
- Would require versioning, documentation, support overhead

**Reconsider If:** Users request specific API features, third-party tools want integration, clear use cases emerge.

### CAD Software Plugins

**Why Rejected:**

- Extremely high effort per platform (SolidWorks, Fusion 360, etc.)
- Different plugin APIs, multiple CAD version maintenance
- Users can export geometry manually
- Not feasible without dedicated plugin team

---

## Category 6: Workflow Automation

### AI/ML Pattern Optimization

**Why Out of Scope:**

- Research-level feature requiring deep composites expertise, ML infrastructure, training data collection, pattern validation
- Users can use existing research tools separately

### Automatic Parameter Tuning

**Why Rejected:**

- Requires sophisticated simulation with long computation times
- Users prefer predictable manual control over "magic" automation
- Risk of unexpected results

---

## Category 7: Cloud & Infrastructure Features

### Cloud Sync & Sharing

**Why Rejected:**

- Requires backend infrastructure, complex conflict resolution, offline support, security/privacy measures
- Users can manage files with OneDrive/Dropbox/Git
- High operational complexity and maintenance burden
- No evidence users want this feature

**Reconsider If:** Multiple users request it, evidence local file management insufficient, willingness to host/maintain infrastructure, clear collaboration use case.

### Batch Processing GUI

**Why Rejected:**

- Niche production use case (most users work on one part at a time)
- CLI already supports all operations via scripting
- GUI batch UI adds complexity without clear value

**Alternative:** Document CLI batch scripting:

```bash
for file in *.wind; do
  fiberpath plan "$file" --output "${file%.wind}.gcode"
done
```

**Reconsider If:** Multiple users request batch GUI, CLI scripting insufficient, clear high-volume production use case.

---

## Category 8: Technical Debt & Refactoring

### Rust Async Timeout for Subprocess Operations

**Issue:** `MarlinSubprocess.read_response()` uses synchronous `BufReader::read_line()` which can block indefinitely if Python subprocess hangs.

**Why Deferred:**

- Python subprocess already has timeout protection (non-critical)
- Requires tokio async/await refactor (3-4 hours: convert all Tauri commands to async, add tokio dependencies, update error types)
- Current implementation works in practice

**Solution:** Convert to tokio async with `timeout(Duration::from_secs(5), stdout_reader.read_line())`. Only implement if blocking becomes a real issue.

---

## Summary

**Total Backlog Items:** ~84+ tasks across 7 categories

**Implementation Policy:**

- ❌ Do NOT implement without strong user demand and clear value proposition
- ❌ Do NOT implement if complexity >> value
- ✅ Re-evaluate only if multiple users request feature with clear use case

**Evaluation Criteria:**

1. Multiple users requesting feature
2. Current functionality demonstrably insufficient
3. Clear, measurable value
4. Reasonable complexity
5. Acceptable maintenance burden
6. Aligns with FiberPath's core mission (practical G-code generation for composite fiber winding)
