# FiberPath Roadmap v4 - Tabbed Interface & Marlin Streaming

**Focus:** Enable basic Marlin G-code streaming directly from the GUI  
**Timeline:** 2 weeks  
**Branch:** tabsgui

**Philosophy:** Ship minimal viable streaming FAST, then enhance based on user feedback

- [x] Update CLI stream command to use new API
- [x] Update all test cases for new API

**Progress:** 21/21 tasks complete (100%) ✅

---

## Phase 2: Tauri Integration

- [x] Add `list_ports` action to interactive.py using serial.tools.list_ports
- [x] Return port device, description, and hwid in JSON response
- [x] Create Tauri command: `marlin_list_ports` (proxy to Python subprocess)
- [x] Create Tauri command: `marlin_start_interactive` (spawn Python subprocess)
- [x] Store subprocess handle in Tauri state
- [x] Implement stdin writer for JSON commands
- [x] Implement stdout reader thread for JSON responses
- [x] Create Tauri command: `marlin_connect`

### Completed Improvements

#### **TypeScript Code Quality**

- [x] **Remove TODO comments** → All TODO comments removed from production code
- [x] **Consolidate CSS variables** → Added 25+ color tokens, replaced all hardcoded colors in 6 CSS files
- [x] **Reduce console.error usage** → Removed from useCliHealth.ts (ErrorBoundary keeps console.error for crash logging - appropriate)
- [x] **Type safety** → Replaced all 'any' types with proper TypeScript/AJV types
- [x] **Extract magic numbers** → Created `lib/constants.ts` with comprehensive constants
- [x] **Deduplicate toast messages** → Created `lib/toastMessages.ts` with centralized templates

#### **Component Architecture**

- [x] **Extract StreamTab event listeners** → Created `hooks/useStreamEvents.ts`, reduced StreamTab from 161 to 70 lines
- [x] **Component sizes** → Verified appropriate:
  - ConnectionSection: 247 lines (clear sections: refresh/connect/disconnect)
  - FileStreamingSection: 242 lines (file selection/streaming controls)
  - ManualControlSection: 162 lines (common commands/manual input)
  - StreamTab: 70 lines (clean layout container)
  - All components have single, clear responsibilities
- [x] **Loading states** → Consistent `commandLoading` pattern from store + local `refreshing` for refresh button (appropriate)

#### **CSS Consistency**

- [x] **CSS variable coverage** → Comprehensive tokens in `tokens.css` (201 lines), all hardcoded colors replaced
- [x] **CSS naming** → BEM naming verified across components (utility classes like `help-button` are appropriate)
- [x] **Duplicate styles** → Eliminated through CSS variables

#### **Rust Code Quality**

- [x] **Remove dead code** → Removed unused `CommandError` variant and `stop_subprocess()` method
- [x] **Improve error messages** → Enhanced 6 error messages with debug formatting for better diagnostics

## Scope Decisions

**Removed from v4 (moved to v5 or later):**

- Settings tab with persistent preferences → **v5**
- Command history (up/down arrows) → **v5** _(nice-to-have, not essential)_
- Response parsing (extract coordinates from M114) → **v5** _(nice-to-have, raw response sufficient for v4)_
- Advanced statistics (ETA, time elapsed) → **v5**
- Log filtering (errors only, commands only) → **v5**
- Export log to file → **v5**
- Timestamps on log messages → **v5**
- 3-panel layout with visualization → **v5 or v6**
- Real-time 3D streaming visualization → **v6 or future**

**Included in v4 (essential features):**

- ✅ Manual command input (test connection, send arbitrary G-code)
- ✅ Common command buttons (Home, Get Position, Emergency Stop, Disable Motors)
- ✅ Command response display in log

**Why manual control is essential:**

Users cannot safely stream G-code files without:

1. Testing connection works (send M114, verify response)
2. Homing machine first (G28 is required before most operations)
3. Emergency stop capability (M112 for safety)
4. Disable motors after streaming (M18 prevents overheating)

These are not "enhancements" - they're basic requirements for any G-code controller.

## Notes

**Architecture:** Python backend with JSON stdin/stdout subprocess communication.

**Python Backend:**

- Connection-centric API (connect → send commands → stream → disconnect)
- JSON protocol in `fiberpath_cli/interactive.py`
- All 73 tests passing

**Tauri Integration:**

- Spawn Python subprocess (~150 lines Rust)
- JSON stdin/stdout for communication
- Event streaming for progress updates

**Scope:** Minimal viable streaming. Settings, manual commands, and statistics deferred to v5.

**Last Updated:** 2026-01-09
