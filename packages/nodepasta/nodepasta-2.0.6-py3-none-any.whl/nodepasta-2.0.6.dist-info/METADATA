## NodePasta
Want to implement a visual scripting system into your program but don't want to write it yourself? NodePasta has got you covered.

NodePasta is a node based-visual scripting framework that lets you define your own nodes and it will take care of the rest.
A NodePasta NodeGraph is UI agnostic, meaning you can load and run graphs without needing a UI implented, but the real magic comes from letting your users
develop their own graphs. NodePasta comes pre-packaged with a editor UI written for imgui and TKInter, that you can embed into your application.
