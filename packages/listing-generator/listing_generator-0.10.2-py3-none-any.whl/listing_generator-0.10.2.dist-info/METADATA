        subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
        2. Grant of Copyright License.
        
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
        hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
        royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to reproduce, prepare
        Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense,
        and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
        Object form.
        
        3. Grant of Patent License.
        
        Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, each Contributor
        hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
        royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this section) patent
        license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import, and
        otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
        patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily
        infringed by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their
        Contribution(s) with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was
        submitted. If You institute patent litigation against any entity
        (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
        the Work or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes
        direct or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
        granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
        as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
        4. Redistribution.
        
        You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative
        Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
        Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:
        
           (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
               Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
           (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
               stating that You changed the files; and
        
           (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
               that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
               attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
               excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
               the Derivative Works; and
        
           (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
               distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
               include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
               within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
               pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
               of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
               as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
               documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
               within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
               wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
               of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
               do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
               notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
               or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
               that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
               as modifying the License.
        
        You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
        may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
        for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
        for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
        reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
        the conditions stated in this License.
        
        5. Submission of Contributions.
        
        Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any Contribution intentionally
        submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the Licensor shall be
        under the terms and conditions of this License, without any additional
        terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall
        supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you
        may have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
        6. Trademarks.
        
        This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
        trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
        except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
        origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
        7. Disclaimer of Warranty.
        
        Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in writing, Licensor
        provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its Contributions)
        on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND,
        either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
        warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,

        determining the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work
        and assume any risks associated with Your exercise of permissions
        under this License.
        
        8. Limitation of Liability.
        
        In no event and under no legal theory, whether in tort
        (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required
        by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts)
        or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You
        for damages, including any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
        or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of
        this License or out of the use or inability to use the Work
        (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
        work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and
        all other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
        has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
        9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability.
        
        While redistributing the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may
        choose to offer, and charge a fee for, acceptance of support,
        Warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations and/or rights
        consistent with this License. However, in accepting such obligations,
        You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
        not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to
        indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
        incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
        of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
        END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Listing Generator

A tool for building dense contexts from source code: traverses projects, filters and normalizes files, then assembles them into a single clean Markdown document — perfect for ChatGPT/Copilot/Gemini/Claude and other LLM assistants.

> In short: you store selection rules in `lg-cfg/` (YAML + context templates), and LG renders "ready-to-paste" text or returns a JSON report with token statistics.

---

## Why and Who Is It For

**Target audience:** developers, team leads, and technical writers who engage in dialogues with AI agents about real code, perform reviews, assign tasks, capture iteration context, while model window size is limited.

**Why:** modern agents work noticeably better when they see **exactly the needed code** with **minimal noise**: no junk from `node_modules/`, logs, generated files, huge binaries, etc. Manual preparation of such context is painful. LG automates:

* selection of relevant files (by filters and extensions),
* light normalization (e.g., Markdown headers, "trivial" `__init__.py`),
* assembly into a single document with **visible file markers**,
* `.gitignore` awareness,
* **`changes` mode** (only modified files),
* **templates and contexts** (section insertions and nested templates),
* size/token estimation and shares ("who's eating the prompt").

There are many ways to form prompts and attach relevant code snippets: from manual copying to context embedding features in IDEs with integrated AI chats. LG differs by doing this **systematically and reproducibly**: rules are stored in the repository, not in your head or AI conversation history.

You describe **what** and **how** goes into the prompt in advance (through sections and templates). This enforces discipline, allows you to "tune" density and **avoid overflowing the model window**, as well as reproduce successful queries through saved templates.

---

## What a "Healthy" AI Agent Workflow Looks Like

1. **Describe rules in the repository**
   Create `lg-cfg/sections.yaml` and additional `*.sec.yaml` as needed. These describe sections (file sets + filters). Use `*.tpl.md` and `*.ctx.md` for templates and contexts.

2. **Build context**
   Render: either a "section" (virtual context of one file set), or a "context" (template that can include multiple sections and other templates).

3. **Iteratively compress**
   Check token statistics (who has the "heaviest share"), move secondary content to separate sections, include on demand. For "small updates" use `--mode changes`.

4. **Save successful prompts**
   Contexts and templates (`*.ctx.md` and `*.tpl.md`) are your "well-working" query formats: reproducible, versionable, with variants for different tasks and agents.

---

## Quick Start

### Installation and Running

Requires Python ≥ 3.10.

Installation:

```bash
# Install from project directory
pip install -e .
```

Verification:

```bash
# Check via module
python -m lg.cli --version

# Or via installed command
listing-generator --version
```

Environment and cache check:

```bash
python -m lg.cli diag
python -m lg.cli diag --rebuild-cache
```

---

## What Goes in `lg-cfg/`

> Important: the configuration directory is always named **`lg-cfg/`**.

Example structure:

```
lg-cfg/
├─ sections.yaml           # sections file (can be in any directory)
├─ additional.sec.yaml     # additional section set (can have many)
├─ intro.tpl.md            # template (can have many, in any subfolders)
├─ onboarding.ctx.md       # context (can have many, in any subfolders)
└─ sub-fold/
   ├─ sections.yaml        # another sections.yaml (sections get sub-fold/ prefix)
   └─ extra.sec.yaml
```

### Sections

* `sections.yaml` — sections file. Can be in `lg-cfg/` root and in any subdirectories.
  - In root: sections without prefix (e.g., `docs`, `src`)
  - In subdirectories: sections with directory prefix (e.g., `adapters/src` from `lg-cfg/adapters/sections.yaml`)
* `*.sec.yaml` — additional section sets (fragments).

A section describes:

* which file extensions to consider,
* allow/block filters over the tree,
* policy for empty files, code-fence, and language adapters.

Minimal example:

```yaml
# Section for project documentation
docs:
  extensions: [".md"]
  markdown:
    # Normalize headings to H2 (outside fenced blocks), remove single H1 at start
    max_heading_level: 2
  filters:
    mode: allow            # default-deny within section
    allow:
      - "/README.md"
      - "/docs/**"

# Core-model submodule sources
core-model-src:
  extensions: [".py", ".md", ".yaml", ".json", ".toml"]
  skip_empty: true
  markdown:
    max_heading_level: 3
  filters:
    mode: allow
    allow:
      - "/core-model/**"
    children:
      core-model:
        mode: block
        block:
          - "**/.pytest_cache/**"
          - "/ROADMAP.md"

# Separate section for roadmap (as text)
core-model-roadmap:
  extensions: [".md"]
  filters:
    mode: allow
    allow:
      - "/core-model/ROADMAP.md"
```

### Filters: How They Work

* Rule tree — **default-allow** (`mode: block`) or **default-deny** (`mode: allow`).
* At each level: first `block`, then (if node is `allow`) — **strict** check against `allow`.
  If `mode: allow` and path doesn't match local `allow`, it's **immediately rejected**.
* `block` is always stronger than `allow`.
* Project's `.gitignore` is respected.
* LG also carefully **doesn't descend** into subtrees that won't yield anything (early pruner).

### Contexts and Templates

* Contexts: `*.ctx.md` (top-level documents).
* Templates: `*.tpl.md` (fragments for insertion).

Example:

```markdown
# Project Introduction

${tpl:intro}

## Core-model module source code

${core-model-src}

## Additional section

${sub-fold/extra/bar}

## Current task

${task}
```

Sections from root `lg-cfg/sections.yaml` are accessible directly (`${docs}`).
Sections from subdirectory `sections.yaml` files have directory prefix (e.g., `${adapters/src}` from `lg-cfg/adapters/sections.yaml`).
Fragments use hierarchical paths: file `sub-fold/extra.sec.yaml` → section `bar` → `${sub-fold/extra/bar}`.

**Context-dependent references**: From templates in subdirectories, you can use short names.
Example: from `lg-cfg/adapters/overview.ctx.md` you can write `${src}` and it will resolve to `adapters/src`.

Special placeholder `${task}` inserts text from `--task` argument:
* `${task}` — simple insertion (empty string if not specified)
* `${task:prompt:"default text"}` — with default value
* `{% if task %}...{% endif %}` — conditional block insertion

*More details:* [templates.md](docs/en/templates.md).

## Language Adapters

Listing Generator uses adapters for different languages and formats. They help "optimize" listings: remove junk, normalize headings, filter paragraphs, or even strip function bodies leaving only signatures. Adapter settings are specified right in section YAML — globally for the section or targeted to specific paths via `targets`.

### Configuration Example

```yaml
core:
  extensions: [".py", ".md"]
  skip_empty: true

  # Global rules for entire section
  python:
    strip_function_bodies: false

  markdown:
    max_heading_level: 2

  # Local overrides for specific folders and files
  targets:
    - match: "/pkg/**.py"
      python:
        strip_function_bodies: true      # only signatures in this folder

    - match: ["/docs/**.md", "/notes/*.md"]
      markdown:
        drop:
          sections:
            - match: { kind: regex, pattern: "^(License|Changelog|Contributing)$", flags: "i" }
```

In this example, the `core` section describes two languages. For Python, stripping function bodies is globally disabled, but inside the `/pkg/` folder it's enabled. For Markdown, a general heading level is set, but in `/docs/` and `/notes/` paragraphs will additionally be filtered by specified patterns.

The `match` key accepts either a string or a list of glob patterns. When multiple rules match, the more specific (longer and more concrete) one wins; if equal — the later one in the list. This allows neatly layering local "overrides" on top of section settings.

Separate empty file policy (`skip_empty` at section level and `empty_policy` in adapters) works as if it's part of language options: the section sets the general strategy, and the adapter can refine it if needed. Possible values: `empty_policy: inherit|include|exclude`.

---

### Available Adapters

#### Markdown

* Normalize headings (remove lone H1, shift levels).
* Systematically **drop entire sections** by headings (with subtree).
* Remove **YAML front matter** at the beginning.
* Insert **placeholders** in place of removed content (optionally).

*More details:* [markdown.md](docs/en/markdown.md).

#### Programming Languages

*More details:* [adapters.md](docs/en/adapters.md).

---

## Token Statistics

To facilitate the process of optimizing listings and contexts, LG provides a summary report on token usage.

LG supports several open-source tokenization libraries (tiktoken, tokenizers, sentencepiece) and requires explicit specification of tokenization parameters on each run.

*More details:* [tokenizers.md](docs/en/tokenizers.md).

---

## Adaptive Capabilities

All methods for creating universal templates and section configurations are described in the [Adaptive Capabilities](docs/en/adaptability.md) section.
<!-- lg:comment:start -->
---

## CLI Options

General format:

```bash
listing-generator <command> <target> [--mode MODESET:MODE] [--tags TAG1,TAG2] [<additional_flags>]

# For render/report, tokenization parameters are required:
listing-generator render|report <target> \
  --lib <tiktoken|tokenizers|sentencepiece> \
  --encoder <encoder_name> \
  --ctx-limit <tokens>
```

Where `<target>`:

* `ctx:<name>` — takes file `lg-cfg/<name>.ctx.md` (subfolders supported).
* `sec:<id>` — virtual context of a single section (canonical ID).
* `<name>` — searches first as `ctx:<name>`, otherwise as `sec:<id>`.

Commands:

* `render` — output **final text only** (Markdown).
* `report` — **JSON report** (format v5): statistics, files, context block.
* `list contexts|sections|tokenizer-libs|encoders` — list available entities (JSON).
* `diag` — environment/cache/config diagnostics (JSON), has `--rebuild-cache`.

Tokenization parameters:

* `--lib` — tokenization library (`tiktoken`, `tokenizers`, `sentencepiece`)
* `--encoder` — encoder/model name (e.g.: `cl100k_base`, `gpt2`, `google/gemma-2-2b`)
* `--ctx-limit` — context window size in tokens (e.g.: `128000`, `200000`)

Examples:

```bash
# Render context from template with tokenization for GPT-4
listing-generator render ctx:onboarding \
  --lib tiktoken \
  --encoder cl100k_base \
  --ctx-limit 128000 > prompt.md

# Render "section only" (no template)
listing-generator render sec:core-model-src \
  --lib tiktoken \
  --encoder cl100k_base \
  --ctx-limit 128000 > prompt.md

# Same but only changed files in working tree
listing-generator render ctx:onboarding \
  --lib tiktoken \
  --encoder cl100k_base \
  --ctx-limit 128000 \
  --mode vcs:branch-changes > prompt.md

# JSON report with token stats for GPT-4o
listing-generator report ctx:onboarding \
  --lib tiktoken \
  --encoder o200k_base \
  --ctx-limit 200000 > report.json

# Report for Gemini using sentencepiece
listing-generator report ctx:onboarding \
  --lib sentencepiece \
  --encoder google/gemma-2-2b \
  --ctx-limit 1000000 > report.json

# Render context with current task description
listing-generator render ctx:dev \
  --lib tiktoken --encoder cl100k_base --ctx-limit 128000 \

## How LG Renders Documents

* If **all files are Markdown/plain text**, LG simply concatenates their content.
* Otherwise:

  * **with code-fence** (default): blocks by languages, grouped **in order of occurrence**;
    inside each block — file marker `# —— FILE: path ——`, then content.
  * **without code-fence**: linear document with marker before each file.

This makes the prompt **readable** for humans and convenient for agents: it's clear where each fragment comes from.

---

## Cache and Performance

LG uses file cache `.lg-cache`:

* **Processed cache** — adapter results + their metadata.
* **Raw/Processed tokens** — saved token counts (by model/mode).
* **Rendered tokens** — count of final document ("with glue") and "sections-only".

Cache keys consider tool version, file fingerprint, adapter config, group composition, etc.
Management: `listing-generator diag`, `listing-generator diag --rebuild-cache`. Can disable cache via `LG_CACHE=0`.

## Practical Tips for "Dense" Contexts

* **Keep sections small and thematic.** Better several sections than one "everything about everything".
* **Strict `allow` nodes** use where full content predictability is needed.
* **Markdown templates** apply as prompt "frame": brief intro, tasks, section placeholders.
* **`changes` mode** — best friend for patch iterations and code review via LLM.
* **Watch shares** (`promptShare`/`ctxShare`) in `report`: helps distribute "holding cost".
* **Normalize headings** (`max_heading_level`) — makes reading long contexts easier.
* **Don't drag secrets.** Configure `block` for artifacts/keys/secrets/binaries.

---

## IDE/Plugin Integration

In most cases you'll run LG **through integration** (VS Code / JetBrains, etc.).
Nevertheless, **all selection/template logic lives in the repository** (`lg-cfg/`), so:

* reviewing and evolving rules is simple (via PRs),
* transferring successful prompts between projects — trivial,
* same configuration works in CLI and IDE.
