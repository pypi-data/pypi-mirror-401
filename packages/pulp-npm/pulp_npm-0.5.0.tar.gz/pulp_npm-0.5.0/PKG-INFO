## About Pulp
Pulp is a platform for managing repositories of content, such as software
packages, and pushing that content out to large numbers of consumers.

Using Pulp you can:
- Locally mirror all or part of a repository
- Host your own content in a new repository
- Manage content from multiple sources in one place
- Promote content through different repos in an organized way

## About pulp_npm
The plugin pulp_npm currently supports mirroring one specific version of a package and make it available.
Since the plugin is API compatible with the NPM Registry, you can use the `npm` CLI to download packages from Pulp.
For ex:
```
npm install --registry http://localhost:5001/pulp/content/{domain}/npm/ react
```

We are working to support more ways of mirroring the NPM Registry and allow uploads of npm content to pulp_npm.
