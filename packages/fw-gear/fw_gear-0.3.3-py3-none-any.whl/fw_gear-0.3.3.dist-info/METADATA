# FW Gear

> **⚠️ BETA RELEASE** - This repository is currently in beta until December 31st,
> 2025. General Availability (GA) release is planned for Q1 2026.

**fw-gear** is a python package maintained by
[Flywheel](https://flywheel.io) It provides a set of modules for facilitating Flywheel
gears development.

## Installation

```bash
pip install fw-gear
```

## Documentation

The documentation for the **fw-gear** can be found on the
[Flywheel Scientific Solutions documentation site](https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/scientific-solutions/lib/fw-gear/)

## Contributing

### Building

The dependency and virtual environment manager for the gear toolkit is [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

```bash
poetry install
```

or

```bash
poetry install -E all
```

to install with extras.

### Testing, Linting, Building doc

Linting, Testing and Documentation building are all done using `pre-commit`.

After installing poetry, the `pre-commit` command will be installed.
Make sure pre-commit hooks are installed by running
either `poetry run pre-commit install` or from within
the poetry shell `pre-commit install`.
After hooks are installed, they will
automatically be run on each `git commit`, they can all be skipped by
running `git commit --no-verify` or
specific hooks can be skipped by setting
the environmental variable, ex. `SKIP=test:pre-commit:pytest git commit`.

Individual hooks can also be run independently.
For example, to build sphinx-doc, you can
run `pre-commit run publish:doc:test`,
or to run black on all
files: `pre-commit run test:flywheel-lint -a`.
For a list of all hooks, view the [pre-commit-config](./.pre-commit-config.yaml).

### Managing dependencies

To add new dependencies to this repo, please use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
and to follow the below steps:

```bash
# Install my-package:
poetry add my-package
# or install my-package as part of the required packages for development (e.g. pytest):
poetry add my-package --dev
# Sync poetry.lock
poetry lock
```

### Building and releasing

#### Local building

To build the project locally and verify if the build was successful, you can run

```bash
poetry build --format wheel
twine check dist/*.whl
```

#### Versioning and project information

The `pyproject.toml` file has replaced the usual `setup.py` in this
repository and contains information on contributors, maintainers,
project description, project URLs, and project version.
In order to change any information on the project,
it must be changed in the `pyproject.toml` file.

Documentation for this file can be found on the
[Poetry pyproject.toml documentation page](https://python-poetry.org/docs/pyproject/),
and information on dependency version specification
syntax can be found in the
[Poetry dependency specification guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/dependency-specification/).
