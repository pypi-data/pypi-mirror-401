    _y_padding : int
        Vertical padding added to each region’s height.
    _grid_width : int
        Width of the image (derived from `image.width`).
    _grid_height : int
        Height of the image (derived from `image.height`).

        List of generated image regions in the grid.

    Methods
    -------

        Returns an ImageRegionList of the generated grid cells, sorted by row.
    generate_spaced_points(total_size, starting_point, spacing) -> list[int]
        Generates a list of coordinates spaced evenly from a starting point 
        until the edges of the image are reached.

        Parameters
        ----------
        image : object
            An object with `.width` and `.height` attributes (e.g., PIL Image).
        x_center : int
            X-coordinate of the central grid point.
        y_center : int
            Y-coordinate of the central grid point.
        x_spacing : int
            Horizontal distance between centers of adjacent grid cells.
        y_spacing : int
            Vertical distance between centers of adjacent grid cells.
        x_padding : int
            Extra pixels added to each side horizontally.
        y_padding : int
            Extra pixels added to each side vertically.

    def _generate_image_regions(self):
        """
        Internal method to generate ImageRegion objects 
        based on the spacing, center, and padding parameters.

        Each region's width and height are determined as:
            width  = 0.5 * x_spacing + (2 * x_padding)
            height = 0.5 * y_spacing + (2 * y_padding)

        The method uses `generate_spaced_points` to determine
        the center positions of all rows and columns, then creates
        ImageRegion objects for each grid cell.

        Notes
        -----
        - This method modifies `self._image_regions` in place.
        - The generated ImageRegion objects are annotated with 
          grid row/column indices and their center coordinates.
