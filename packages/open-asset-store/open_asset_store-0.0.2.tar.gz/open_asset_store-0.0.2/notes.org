- =asset_db/query.py= and =asset_db/extract.py= should not be necessary.
  It is better to extend interfaces of =open-asset-model= and use a
  systematic approach in the =asset-db= in order to follow the
  Open/Close principle.

- =Edge.id= is currently not stored as an =edge_id= like =Entity= do.
  =find_edge_by_id= rely on the internal store representation which make
  the resulting graph not interoperable.

 - Neo4j repository is full of SQL injection

 - =get_*_by_content= is not implemented the same way in Neo4j and Pg/SQLite
 
 - I have added a =create_relation= to the base repository
