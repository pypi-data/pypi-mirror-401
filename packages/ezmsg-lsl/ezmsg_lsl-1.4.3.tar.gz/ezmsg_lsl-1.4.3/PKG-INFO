## Developers

We use [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) for development. It is not strictly required, but if you intend to contribute to ezmsg-lsl then using `uv` will lead to the smoothest collaboration.

1. Install [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) if not already installed.
2. Fork ezmsg-lsl and clone your fork to your local computer.
3. Open a terminal and `cd` to the cloned folder.
4. `uv sync` to create a .venv and install dependencies.
5. (Optional) Install pre-commit hooks: `uv run pre-commit install`
6. After editing code and making commits, Run the test suite before making a PR: `uv run pytest tests`
   * Currently, there are no substantial tests.
