              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A

              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing

# QCut

QCut is a quantum circuit knitting package built on top of qiskit for performing gate cuts and resetless wire cuts allowing simulation of larger quantum circuits on smaller quantum devices or simulators at the cost of a circuit overhead. QCut has been designed and tested to work with IQM's qpus, and the Finnish Quantum Computing Infrastructure ([FiQCI](https://fiqci.fi/)).

QCut has been built at CSC - IT Center for Science (Finnish IT Center for Science).

Check out [jooniv.github.io/QCut/](https://jooniv.github.io/QCut/) for documentation and more examples.

# Installation

For installation a UNIX-like system is currently needed due to pymetis being used for automatic cut finding. On Windows use WSL

**Pip:**  
Installation should be done via `uv`

```bash
uv pip install QCut
#or
uv add QCut
```

Uv can be installed with

```bash
#Linux / mac
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

Note: for drawing circuits you might have to install pylatexenc. This can also be done with uv.

```bash
uv pip install pylatexenc
#or
uv add pylatexenc
```

**Install from source**  
It is also possible to use QCut by cloning this repository and including it in your project folder.

```bash
cd QCut
uv pip install .
#or
uv sync --no-dev

#or with dev deps
uv sync
```

# Usage

## Manual Usage

**1: Import needed packages**

```python
import QCut as ck
from QCut import cut, cutGate
from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, transpile
from qiskit.circuit.library import CXGate
from qiskit.quantum_info import SparsePauliOp
from qiskit.circuit.library import CXGate
from qiskit_aer import AerSimulator
from qiskit.primitives import Estimator, BackendEstimator
from iqm.qiskit_iqm import IQMFakeAdonis
```

**2: Start by defining a QuantumCircuit just like in Qiskit**

```python
circuit  =  QuantumCircuit(4)

mult = 1.635
circuit.r(mult*0.46262, mult*0.1446, 0)
circuit.cx(0,1)
circuit.cx(1,2)
circuit.cx(2,3)
   
circuit.draw("mpl")
```

![](./docs/_static/images/circ1.png)

**3: Insert cut operations to the circuit to denote where we want to cut the circuit**

Note that here we don't insert any measurements. Measurements will be automatically handled by QCut.

```python
from qiskit.circuit.library import CXGate

cut_circuit = QuantumCircuit(4)

mult = 1.635
cut_circuit.r(mult*0.46262, mult*0.1446, 0)
cut_circuit.append(**cutGate(CXGate(), 0, 1)) 
cut_circuit.append(cut, [1])
cut_circuit.cx(1,2)
cut_circuit.cx(2,3)

cut_circuit.decompose(gates_to_decompose=["CutGate"]).draw("mpl")
```

**Note** that currently QCut only supports cutting Cz gates so cut gates get transpiled down to CutCZ gates (hence the added H gates)


![](./docs/_static/images/circ2.png)

**4: Extract cut locations from cut_circuit and split it into independent subcircuit.**

```python
cut_circuit = ck.get_locations_and_subcircuits(cut_circuit)
```

Now we can draw our subcircuits.

```python
cut_circuit.subcircuits[0].draw("mpl")
```

![](./docs/_static/images/circ3.png)

```python
cut_circuit.subcircuits[1].draw("mpl")
```

![](./docs/_static/images/circ4.png)

```python
cut_circuit.subcircuits[2].draw("mpl")
```

![](./docs/_static/images/circ11.png)

**5 Define backend and transpile the cut circuit**

```python
fake = IQMFakeAdonis() #noisy
sim = AerSimulator() #ideal
```

```python
transpiled = ck.transpile_subcircuits(cut_circuit, fake, optimization_level=3)
```

**6: Generate experiment circuits**

```python
observables = SparsePauliOp(["IIIZ", "IIZI", "IZII", "IIZZ"])

cut_experiment = ck.get_experiment_circuits(transpiled, observables)
```

Note that both `CutCircuit` and `CutExperiment` classes implement the `assing_parameters()` function of `Qiskit.QuantumCircuit`

**7: Run the experiment circuits**

```python
results = ck.run_experiments(cut_experiment, backend=fake)
```

**8: Define observables and calculate expectation values**

```python
expectation_values = ck.estimate_expectation_values(results, cut_experiment.expv_data())
```

**9: Finally calculate the exact and noisy expectation values of the original circuit and compare them to the results calculated with QCut**

```python
obs = [ob.to_label() for ob in observables.paulis]

estimator = Estimator()
exact_expvals = (
    estimator.run([circuit] * len(obs), obs).result().values
)


tr = transpile(circuit, backend=fake)

tr_obs = observables.apply_layout(tr.layout)

tr_obs_separate = [
    SparsePauliOp(pauli.to_label()) for pauli in tr_obs.paulis
]

fake_estimator = BackendEstimator(fake)
exps = (
    fake_estimator.run([tr] * len(tr_obs_separate), tr_obs_separate).result().values
)
```

```python
import numpy as np

np.set_printoptions(formatter={"float": lambda x: f"{x:0.6f}"})

print(f"QCut expectation values:{np.array(expectation_values)}")
print(f"Noisy expectation values with fake backend:{np.array(exps)}")
print(f"Exact expectation values with ideal simulator :{np.array(exact_expvals)}")
```

`QCut expectation values:[0.704039 0.615275 0.554269 0.808868]`

`Noisy expectation values with fake backend:[0.587891 0.669922 0.500000 0.777344]`

`Exact expectation values with ideal simulator :[0.727323 0.727323 0.727323 1.000000]`

As we can see QCut is able to accurately reconstruct the expectation values and be more accurate that just using the fake backend as is. (Note that since this is a probabilistic method the results vary a bit each run)

Additionally we can execute QCut using the ideal Aer simulator and see that we get (practically) exact results:


`QCut expectation values:[0.699436 0.713172 0.713172 0.979377]`


## Usage shorthand

For convenience, it is not necessary to go through each of the aforementioned steps individually. Instead, QCut provides a function `run()` that executes the whole wire-cutting sequence.

The same example can then be run like this:

```python
sim = AerSimulator()
observables = SparsePauliOp(["IIIZ", "IIZI", "IZII", "IIZZ"])

estimated_expectation_values = ck.run(cut_circuit, observables, sim)
```

## Automatic cuts

QCut comes with functionality for automatically finding good cut locations that can place both wire and gate cuts.

```python
from QCut import find_cuts

cut_circuit = find_cuts(circuit , 3, cuts="both")

estimated_expectation_values = ck.run_cut_circuit(cut_circuit, observables, sim)

np.set_printoptions(formatter={"float": lambda x: f"{x:0.6f}"})

print(f"QCut expectation values:{np.array(estimated_expectation_values)}")
print(f"Exact expectation values with ideal simulator :{np.array(exact_expvals)}")
```

`QCut expectation values:[0.699436 0.713172 0.713172 0.979377]`

`Exact expectation values with ideal simulator :[0.727323 0.727323 0.727323 1.000000]`


## Running on IQM fake backends

To use QCut with IQM's fake backends it is required to install [Qiskit IQM](https://github.com/iqm-finland/qiskit-on-iqm). QCut supports version 17.8. Installation can be done with uv:

```bash
uv pip install qiskit-iqm==17.8
#or
uv add qiskit-iqm==17.8

```

After installation just import the backend you want to use:

```python
from iqm.qiskit_iqm import IQMFakeAdonis
backend = IQMFakeAdonis()
```

## Running on FiQCI

For running on real hardware through the Lumi supercomputer's FiQCI partition follow the instructions [here](https://docs.csc.fi/computing/quantum-computing/helmi/running-on-helmi/). If you are used to using Qiskit on jupyter notebooks it is recommended to use the [Lumi web interface](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/runjobs/webui/).

## Running on other hardware

Running on other providers such as IBM is untested at the moment but as long as the hardware can be accessed with Qiskit QCut should be compatible.
