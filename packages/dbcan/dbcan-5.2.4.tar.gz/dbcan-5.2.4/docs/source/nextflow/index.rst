Nextflow Pipeline Documentation
=================================

The Nextflow pipeline for CAZyme annotation in microbiome data provides an automated, scalable workflow for processing metagenomic sequencing data. This documentation covers how to use the pipeline and understand its outputs.

The pipeline is built using `Nextflow <https://www.nextflow.io/>`_ and follows best practices for reproducible bioinformatics workflows. It supports multiple analysis modes including short-read assembly, long-read assembly, and assembly-free approaches for CAZyme annotation in microbiome datasets.
