Semantic search over indexed client-side code from target web application.

## RETURNS

- **Endpoints**: API URLs, routes, fetch/XHR/axios calls, form actions
- **Architecture**: Page structure, routing logic, component organization
- **Forms**: Input fields, parameter names, validation rules, types

## WHEN TO USE

- Find API endpoints/routes in client-side code
- Identify form inputs and parameter names
- Understand client-side architecture and routing
- Discover authentication/storage patterns (localStorage, cookies)

## USAGE

One simple query per call. Use keywords relevant to what you're searching for:

**Query Patterns**:
- API/endpoints: `"API endpoints"`, `"fetch axios XMLHttpRequest"`
- Forms: `"forms input fields"`, `"form validation"`
- Auth: `"authentication"`, `"localStorage sessionStorage cookie"`
- File uploads: `"file upload FileReader FormData"`
- Events: `"event listeners onclick onsubmit"`

## LIMITATIONS

- **Client-side only**: No server-side source code
- **Pre-indexed**: Previously downloaded content only (not real-time)
- **Discovery not exploitation**: Returns observed facts, not attack guidance

## NOTES

- Keep queries simple and focused (3-5 keywords)
- Stop when you have needed information - don't over-query
- If same results returned repeatedly, that's all available information
- For real-time testing, use send_payload instead
