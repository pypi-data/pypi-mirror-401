This tool returns the raw `storage.json` captured by Playwright sessions.
Always run this tool to gather the information for the current session and authentication information. 
Use cases:
- Retrieve saved cookies/tokens before calling `run_python_file`.
- Share session auth artifacts with the Python interpreter so generated code can reuse authenticated contexts.
- Inspect/parse stored credentials or CSRF tokens when crafting follow-up requests.
