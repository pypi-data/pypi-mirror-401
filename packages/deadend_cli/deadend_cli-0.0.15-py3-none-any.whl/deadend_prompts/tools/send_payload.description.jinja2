Send raw HTTP requests for security testing. Low-level HTTP interface - behaves like programmable proxy/Burp Suite requester.

## USAGE

Send exact HTTP bytes to target, receive raw bytes back. No modification except credential replacement.

Supports:
- All HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)
- Binary bodies, chunked transfer, arbitrary headers
- HTTP and HTTPS connections
- Credential placeholder auto-replacement

## WHEN TO USE

- Test target with single HTTP request
- Test injection payloads for vulnerabilities
- Validate security controls with specific requests

## REQUEST FORMAT

```
METHOD /path?query=value HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: target.domain\r\n
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 ...\r\n
[headers]\r\n
\r\n
[body]\r\n
\r\n
```

## CREDENTIAL HANDLING

Use credential placeholders that auto-replace during execution:
- Email: `<dummy_email>`
- Username: `<dummy_username>`
- Password: `<dummy_password>`

Example: `username=<dummy_username>&password=<dummy_password>`

No manual credential management needed - replacement happens automatically.

## EXAMPLE

```
POST /api/login HTTP/1.1\r\n
Host: target.com\r\n
Content-Type: application/json\r\n
\r\n
{"username":"<dummy_username>","password":"<dummy_password>"}\r\n
\r\n
```

## RULES

- Normalize method to UPPERCASE
- Always include `Host` and `User-Agent` headers
- If `body_encoding` omitted and body has non-UTF-8 bytes, treat as base64
- Extract ONLY ONE request most likely to work
- Return ONLY formatted request, nothing more
- Find NEW payloads different from previous attempts
- Start with small payloads, validate, then escalate
- ONLY use validated endpoints (from tools or context)
- NEVER repeat request that returned error already in context
- Test only unharmful and undetectable payloads
