## CONFIDENCE SCORING

Use this rubric for consistency across all agents:

| Score | Status | Criteria |
|-------|--------|----------|
| 0.8-1.0 | ACHIEVED | Goal met, vulnerability confirmed, flag captured |
| 0.6-0.8 | HIGH | Strong evidence, likely vulnerable, needs validation |
| 0.4-0.6 | MEDIUM | Partial evidence, uncertain, needs more testing |
| 0.2-0.4 | LOW | Weak evidence, exploratory, high uncertainty |
| 0.0-0.2 | FAILED | No progress, wrong approach, blocked |

**Adjustments:**
- +0.1 per successful tool call
- +0.2 for discovering new endpoints/data
- +0.4 for finding vulnerability
- -0.1 per tool failure

Return final score rounded to 1 decimal place.
