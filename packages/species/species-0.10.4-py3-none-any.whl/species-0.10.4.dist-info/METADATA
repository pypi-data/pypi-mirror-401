*species* is a toolkit for atmospheric characterization of directly imaged exoplanets. It provides a coherent framework for spectral and photometric analysis which builds on publicly-available data and models from various resources.

There are tools available for inference of atmospheric and evolutionary parameters, synthetic photometry, interpolation of model grids, color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, empirical spectral analysis, flux calibration, emission line analysis, and more.

The package is available on PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/species/>_ and is developed and maintained on GitHub <https://github.com/tomasstolker/species>_.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation can be found at `http://species.readthedocs.io <http://species.readthedocs.io>`_.

Tutorials
---------

There are several `Jupyter notebooks <https://species.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials.html>`_ with tutorials for various types of analyses and functionalities.
