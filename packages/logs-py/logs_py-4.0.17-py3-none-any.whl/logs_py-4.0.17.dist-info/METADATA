# LOGS-Py

LOGS is a scientific data management system (SDMS) software allowing for automated data collection, visualization, and organization. Within its internal organizational concepts it allows you to enrich you experimental data with metadata. LOGS allows you to adapt many of its organization structures which enables your data management to follow your internal workflows.

**LOGS-Py is a Python package** interacting with the LOGS web API to enable you to extract and push data to LOGS and generally operateinteract with the LOGS backend in a programatic way. The main motivation behind in the desing of library is to keep this interaction as pythonic as possible. The communication with the API remains mainly in the background while the user of the library handles native Python objects whereby theuser is still able to interact with nearly are LOGS functionalities and entities.

Thus _this library_ firstly _targets lab and data scientist_ allowing them to freely interact with experimental data and its meta-data without any pre-knowledge of Web technologies and communication. Secondly, it _facilitates power-users_ to implement highly specific workflows automations and 3rd-party software intergrations with LOGS and other lab software.

## Installation

The **LOGS-Py** package can be easily installed by using `pip`.

For this open the `terminal` and do:

```bash
pip install logs-py
```
