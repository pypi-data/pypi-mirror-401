# Linear Webhook Setup

Claudear uses Linear webhooks to receive real-time notifications when issues change state. This guide covers setting up Linear webhooks.

> **Note:** This guide is for Linear integration. For Notion setup, see [Notion Setup](/docs/notion-setup).

## Setup Overview

When you run `claudear`, it:

1. Starts an ngrok tunnel (if `NGROK_AUTHTOKEN` is set)
2. Displays the webhook URL to register in Linear
3. Listens for incoming webhook events

You'll see output like:

```
[INFO] ngrok tunnel established: https://abc123.ngrok.io
📋 Register this webhook URL in Linear: https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/linear
```

## Registering the Webhook

### 1. Get Your Webhook URL

Start Claudear to get your ngrok URL:

```bash
claudear
```

Note the URL (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

### 2. Create Webhook in Linear

1. Go to **Linear Settings → API → Webhooks**
2. Click **New webhook**
3. Configure:
   - **Label**: Claudear
   - **URL**: `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/webhooks/linear`
   - **Team**: Select your team
   - **Data change events**: Enable "Issues"

### 3. Set the Secret

1. Generate a secret: `openssl rand -hex 32`
2. Enter it in Linear's webhook settings
3. Add it to your `.env`:

```bash
LINEAR_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-generated-secret
```

## Webhook Events

Claudear listens for these events:

| Event | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Issue → Todo | Start new task |
| Issue → In Progress | (from Claudear) |
| Issue → In Review | (from Claudear) |
| Issue → Done | Trigger cleanup/merge |
| New Comment | Check for unblock input |

## Testing the Webhook

### Using the Test Endpoint

```bash
curl https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/webhooks/linear/test
```

Should return:
```json
{"status": "ok", "message": "Webhook endpoint is reachable"}
```

### Using Linear's Test Feature

1. In Linear webhook settings, click **Test**
2. Check Claudear logs for the incoming event

## Troubleshooting

### Webhook Not Receiving Events

1. **Check ngrok is running**: Look for the tunnel URL in logs
2. **Verify URL is correct**: Must include `/webhooks/linear` path
3. **Check team ID**: Webhook must be for the correct team

### Signature Verification Failed

1. **Verify secret matches**: Same value in Linear and `.env`
2. **No extra whitespace**: Copy the secret exactly
3. **Regenerate if needed**: Create a new secret in both places

### Events Delayed

Linear webhooks are near-instant, but if delayed:

1. Check Linear's status page
2. Verify ngrok tunnel is stable
3. Check for rate limiting

## Security Notes

- Always use HTTPS (ngrok provides this)
- Keep your webhook secret secure
- Rotate secrets periodically
- Monitor webhook logs for unusual activity
