# Introduction

Claudear is an open-source autonomous development automation tool that bridges your project management tools with **Claude Code**. It supports both **Linear** (via webhooks) and **Notion** (via polling), letting you manage tasks from whichever platform you prefer.

When you move a task to "Todo" in Linear or Notion, Claudear automatically picks it up, creates an isolated git worktree, runs Claude Code to implement the solution, and manages the full lifecycle through PR creation.

## How It Works

1. **Move a task to Todo** in Linear or Notion
2. Claudear receives the event (webhook for Linear, polling for Notion)
3. A dedicated git worktree and branch are created
4. Claude Code analyzes the task and implements the solution
5. If blocked, Claude posts a comment asking for help
6. When complete, a PR is created and the task moves to "In Review"
7. Move to "Done" to auto-merge the PR

## Key Features

- **Multi-Provider** - Works with both Linear and Notion simultaneously
- **Multi-Team/Database** - Support multiple Linear teams and Notion databases
- **Per-Project Repos** - Each team/database can have its own repository
- **Git Worktrees** - Isolated environments for parallel task execution
- **Claude Code CLI** - Uses your existing Claude Code subscription
- **Human in the Loop** - Claude asks for help when blocked via comments
- **PR Automation** - Creates PRs with proper titles and issue links
- **Auto-Merge** - Move to "Done" to merge PRs automatically
- **Crash Recovery** - SQLite persistence survives restarts

## Why Claudear?

- **Open Source** - MIT licensed, fork and modify freely
- **Self-Hosted** - Runs on your machine, your code stays private
- **No API Costs** - Uses Claude Code subscription, not API credits
- **Full Control** - Configure states, concurrency, timeouts
