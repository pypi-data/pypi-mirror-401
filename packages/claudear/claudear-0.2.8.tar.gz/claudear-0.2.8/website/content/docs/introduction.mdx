# Introduction

Claudear is an open-source autonomous development automation tool that bridges **Linear** project management with **Claude Code**. When you move a Linear issue to "Todo", Claudear automatically picks it up, creates an isolated git worktree, runs Claude Code to implement the task, and manages the full lifecycle through PR creation.

## How It Works

1. **Move an issue to Todo** in Linear
2. Claudear's webhook receives the event
3. A dedicated git worktree and branch are created
4. Claude Code analyzes the issue and implements the solution
5. If blocked, Claude posts a comment asking for help
6. When complete, a PR is created and the issue moves to "In Review"
7. Move to "Done" to auto-merge the PR

## Key Features

- **Linear Integration** - Real-time webhooks for instant task pickup
- **Git Worktrees** - Isolated environments for parallel task execution
- **Claude Code CLI** - Uses your existing Claude Code subscription
- **Human in the Loop** - Claude asks for help when blocked via Linear comments
- **PR Automation** - Creates PRs with proper titles and Linear issue links
- **Crash Recovery** - SQLite persistence survives restarts

## Why Claudear?

- **Open Source** - MIT licensed, fork and modify freely
- **Self-Hosted** - Runs on your machine, your code stays private
- **No API Costs** - Uses Claude Code subscription, not API credits
- **Full Control** - Configure states, concurrency, timeouts

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- Python 3.10 or higher
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI installed and authenticated
- [GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/) (`gh`) installed and authenticated
- A Linear workspace with API access
- [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) account for webhook tunneling (free tier works)
