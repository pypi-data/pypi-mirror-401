# Handling Blocked Tasks

Sometimes Claude needs your help to continue. This is the "human in the loop" feature that makes Claudear practical for real development work.

## When Does Claude Get Blocked?

Claude will pause and ask for help when:

- **Missing information** - The issue description is unclear
- **Access issues** - Can't access a file or resource
- **Design decisions** - Multiple valid approaches exist
- **Permission errors** - Needs credentials or API keys
- **Ambiguous requirements** - Needs clarification

## How It Works

### 1. Claude Detects a Blocker

When Claude encounters an issue, it outputs:

```
BLOCKED: Need clarification on the authentication flow.
Should we use JWT tokens or session cookies?
```

### 2. Claudear Posts to Linear

A comment appears on your Linear issue:

> **Claudear is blocked**
>
> Reason: Need clarification on the authentication flow. Should we use JWT tokens or session cookies?
>
> Please respond with guidance to continue.

### 3. You Respond

Reply to the comment with your guidance:

> Use JWT tokens. Store them in httpOnly cookies for security.
> The refresh token endpoint is at `/api/auth/refresh`.

### 4. Claude Resumes

Claudear detects your comment and:

1. Sends your response to Claude
2. Claude continues the task
3. Issue stays in "In Progress"

## Best Practices

### Writing Good Unblock Responses

**Be specific:**
```
Use the existing UserService class in src/services/user.ts.
The createUser method should validate email format.
```

**Provide examples:**
```
Follow the pattern in src/api/products.ts for the new endpoint.
Error responses should use the format: { error: string, code: number }
```

**Reference files:**
```
See the auth flow in docs/AUTHENTICATION.md for context.
Use the same approach as the login endpoint.
```

### What to Avoid

- **Vague responses** like "make it work" or "figure it out"
- **Changing requirements** mid-task
- **Referencing external docs** without summarizing

## Automatic Detection

Claudear detects blocks through keyword matching:

- `BLOCKED:`
- `I need clarification`
- `I cannot proceed`
- `permission denied`
- `missing information`

Claude is trained to use these phrases when stuck.

## Timeout Handling

If you don't respond within the timeout period (default: 1 hour):

1. Task enters `FAILED` state
2. Comment posted with timeout message
3. Worktree preserved for debugging

To adjust the timeout:

```bash
BLOCKED_TIMEOUT=7200  # 2 hours
```

## Monitoring Blocked Tasks

Check blocked tasks:

```bash
claudear status --blocked
```

Output:
```
Blocked Tasks:
  ENG-123: Add user authentication (blocked 15m ago)
           Reason: Need API endpoint specification
```

## Manual Unblocking

If the polling misses your comment:

```bash
claudear unblock ENG-123
```

This forces Claudear to check for new comments and resume.
