## Instructions
1. Carefully review [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md] to find sections relevant to the task you are trying to acomplish and find relevant URLs.
2. Aquire knowledge necessary for completing the task using relevant URLs from [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md] and the WebFetch tool.
3. Look into the [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md] AGAIN and see if it has any prebuilt components that may make the task at hand significantly easier as it offers an extensive library of them.
4. Carefully read your only true source of AI engineering knowledge, [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md] AGAIN and make sure you really undestood everything and didn't skip any prebuilt components that may make the task at hand significantly easier as it offers an extensive library of them. Also look into https://llamahub.ai/ and the https://github.com/run-llama/llama_index github repository.
5. Complete the required task using ONLY the content from the aquired knowledge.

## Important:

Never use the web search, only use links found IN the guide OR links found by looking inside of links inside of the guide.

## Examples
User: Make me a multi-agent RAG system (only the backend).
You:
*reads [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md]* AHA! I found "Multi-Agent" on line 32! and "" I will now fetch the relevant link to understand how to build the system.
*thought* HMM but the user also asked about RAG! Let me read the guide to see what it is and how we use it!
*WebFetch* multi-agent, rag, tools, llms
*thought* Let me check again to see if there are any prebuilt components helping me!
*reads [LLAMAINDEX_GUIDE.md]*
*WebFetch* hybrid retrieval, tree summarize
*thought* Great! Now I know how to make what the user requested using the latest stuff! Let's make it!"""

## Instructions
1. Carefully review [CHAINLIT_GUIDE.md] to find sections relevant to the task you are trying to accomplish and find relevant URLs.
2. Acquire knowledge necessary for completing the task using relevant URLs from [CHAINLIT_GUIDE.md] and the WebFetch tool.
3. Look into the [CHAINLIT_GUIDE.md] AGAIN and see if it has any prebuilt components (like lifecycle hooks, elements, actions, widgets) that may make the task at hand significantly easier as Chainlit offers an extensive library of them.
4. Carefully read your only true source of Chainlit knowledge, [CHAINLIT_GUIDE.md] AGAIN and make sure you really understood everything and didn't skip any prebuilt components that may make the task at hand significantly easier. Also check the official documentation URLs provided in the guide.
5. Complete the required task using ONLY the content from the acquired knowledge.

## Important:

Never use the web search, only use links found IN the guide OR links found by looking inside of links inside of the guide.

## Examples
User: Make me a Chainlit chat application with user session management.
You:
*reads [CHAINLIT_GUIDE.md]* AHA! I found "User Session" on line 133! I will now fetch the relevant link to understand how to use it.
*thought* HMM but the user also asked about chat application! Let me read the guide to see how to set up lifecycle hooks!
*WebFetch* user session management
*thought* Let me check again to see if there are any lifecycle hooks I should use!
*reads [CHAINLIT_GUIDE.md]*
*WebFetch* lifecycle hooks
*thought* Great! Now I know how to make what the user requested using @cl.on_chat_start, @cl.on_message, and cl.user_session! Let's make it!"""

You:
*reads [FIRECRAWL_GUIDE.md]* AHA! I found "Crawl" and "Extract" features! I will now fetch the relevant links to understand how to use them.
*thought* The user wants both crawling and extraction! Let me read the guide to see how to combine these features!
*WebFetch* crawl website
*thought* Let me check the Extract feature to understand how to get structured data!
*reads [FIRECRAWL_GUIDE.md]*
*WebFetch* extract structured data
*thought* Great! Now I know how to crawl the entire website and extract structured data using Firecrawl! Let's implement it!"""
