# Qdrant

## What is Qdrant?

Qdrant is an AI-native vector database and semantic search engine designed to store, search, and manage vectors along with their associated payload. It enables developers to extract meaningful information from unstructured data by performing similarity searches at scale with high performance and accuracy.

Qdrant addresses the challenge of building production-grade vector search applications by providing efficient storage, fast similarity search, advanced filtering capabilities, and horizontal scalability. It allows developers to focus on their AI applications rather than building vector database infrastructure from scratch.

## Core Concepts

### Collections

[Collections Documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/collections/)

Collections are named sets of points (vectors with payload) that share the same configuration. Each collection has its own settings for vectors, indexing, and optimization.

### Points

[Points Documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/points/)

Points are the central entity in Qdrant. A point is a record consisting of a vector (or multiple vectors) and an optional payload. Each point has a unique ID within a collection.

### Vectors

[Vectors Documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/vectors/)

Vectors are high-dimensional representations of data. Qdrant supports multiple vector types including dense vectors, sparse vectors, and multi-vectors per point.

### Payload

[Payload Documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/payload/)

Payload is additional information stored with each point. It can contain any JSON-compatible data and supports filtering during search operations.

### Search

[Search Documentation](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/search/)

Qdrant provides various search methods including similarity search, filtered search, and recommendation-based search to retrieve the most relevant vectors.
