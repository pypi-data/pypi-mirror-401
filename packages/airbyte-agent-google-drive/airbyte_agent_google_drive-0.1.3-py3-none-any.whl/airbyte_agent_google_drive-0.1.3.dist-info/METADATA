# Google-Drive agent connector

Google Drive is a cloud-based file storage and synchronization service that allows users
to store files, share content, and collaborate on documents. This connector provides
read-only access to files, shared drives, permissions, comments, replies, revisions,
and change tracking for data analysis and integration workflows.

The Google-Drive connector is optimized to handle prompts like these.

- List all files in my Google Drive
- Show me files modified in the last week
- Get details for file abc123
- Download file abc123 from my Drive
- Export Google Doc abc123 as PDF
- Export Google Sheet xyz789 as CSV
- Get the content of file abc123
- List all shared drives I have access to
- Get shared drive xyz789
- Show permissions for file abc123
- List comments on file abc123
- Get all replies to comment def456 on file abc123
- Show revision history for file abc123
- What changes have been made since my last sync?
- Get my Drive storage quota and user info
- List files in a specific folder

## Unsupported questions
