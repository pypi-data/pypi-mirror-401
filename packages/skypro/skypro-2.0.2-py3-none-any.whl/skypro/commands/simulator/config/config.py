    we may find that our SoE is below the line - in which case the approach algorithm kicks in and charges the battery. If our SoE is
    high enough that it sits above the line at a given time, then the approach algorithm doesn't need to do anything.

      reach the peak, so this is often a good strategy).
    - An 'encourage charge' line which defines a softer target SoE. If we are below the 'encourage charge line' then we will only charge if the system
      is long (and prices are relatively low).

    The approach_start time on the illustration above is derived from the `assumed_charge_power` and the `encourage/force_charge_duration_factor`,
