# 📦 Email Attachment Processor
### (YAML + keyring + per-day UID storage + password management + modular architecture)

Email Processor is a reliable, idempotent, and secure tool for automatic IMAP email processing:
- downloads attachments
- organizes them into folders based on subject
- archives processed emails
- stores processed email UIDs in separate files by date
- uses keyring for secure password storage
- **supports new command: `--clear-passwords`**
- **progress bar** for long-running operations
- **file extension filtering** (whitelist/blacklist)
- **disk space checking** before downloads
- **structured logging** with file output
- **dry-run mode** for testing
---

# 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Secure IMAP Password Management
- Password is not stored in code or YAML
- Saved in system storage (**Windows Credential Manager**, **macOS Keychain**, **Linux SecretService**)
- On first run, the script will prompt for password and offer to save it

### ⚙️ Configuration via `config.yaml`
- Download folder management
- Subject-based sorting rules (`topic_mapping`)
- Allowed sender management
- Archive settings
- Behavior options ("process / skip / archive")
- File extension filtering (whitelist/blacklist)
- Progress bar control
- Structured logging configuration

### ⚡ Fast Two-Phase IMAP Fetch
1. Fast header fetch: `FROM SUBJECT DATE UID`
2. Full email (`RFC822`) is loaded **only if it matches the logic**

### 📁 Optimized Processed Email Storage
Each email's UID is saved in:

```
processed_uids/YYYY-MM-DD.txt
```

This ensures:

- 🔥 fast lookup of already processed UIDs
- ⚡ minimal memory usage
- 📉 no duplicate downloads
- 📁 convenient rotation of old records

---

# 🎯 Usage

## Running the Processor

### Normal Mode
```bash
python -m email_processor
# or after installation:
email-processor
```

### Custom Configuration File
```bash
python -m email_processor --config /path/to/custom_config.yaml
```

**Note:** By default, the processor uses `config.yaml` in the current directory. Use `--config` to specify a different configuration file path.

### Dry-Run Mode (Test without downloading)
```bash
python -m email_processor --dry-run
```

**Note:** In dry-run mode, the processor connects to the IMAP server to retrieve and analyze the email list (to display statistics), but files are not downloaded and emails are not archived.

### Dry-Run Mode with Mock Server (No connection)
```bash
python -m email_processor --dry-run-no-connect
```

**Note:** The `--dry-run-no-connect` mode uses a mocked IMAP server with test data. It does not require a real mail server connection or a password. It is useful for testing configuration without server access. It uses 3 test emails:
- Email from `client1@example.com` with subject "Roadmap Q1 2024" and attachment `roadmap.pdf`
- Email from `finance@example.com` with subject "Invoice #12345" and attachment `invoice.pdf`
- Email from `spam@example.com` with subject "Spam Subject" and attachment `spam.exe` (will be skipped if the sender is not in the allowed list)

### Show Version
```bash
python -m email_processor --version
```

### Clear Saved Passwords
```bash
python -m email_processor --clear-passwords
```

### Create Default Configuration
```bash
python -m email_processor --create-config
```

**Note:** This command creates a default `config.yaml` file from `config.yaml.example`. If the file already exists, you'll be prompted to confirm overwriting it. You can combine it with `--config` to specify a custom path:

```bash
python -m email_processor --create-config --config /path/to/custom_config.yaml
```

# ✨ Password Management Command

This command:

### ✔ removes saved password from keyring
### ✔ allows setting a new password on next run
### ✔ useful when:
- IMAP password expired / was changed
- switching to a different email account
- need to reset authorization without accessing Credential Manager

---

## 🔧 How `--clear-passwords` Works

1. Script reads `imap.user` from `config.yaml`
2. Requests confirmation:

```
Do you really want to delete saved passwords? [y/N]:
```

3. If user answers `y`:
  - password `email-vkh-processor / <user>` is removed from keyring

4. Script outputs report:

```
Done. Deleted entries: 1
```

5. On next normal mode run, the script will prompt for a new password.

# ⚡ Implementation Benefits

### ⚡ Time Savings
Duplicate emails are skipped instantly.

### ⚡ Reduced IMAP Server Load
Minimal IMAP operations, partial fetch.

### ⚡ No Duplicate Attachment Downloads
Each attachment is downloaded only once.

### ⚡ No File Duplicates
Automatic numbering is used: `file_01.pdf`, `file_02.pdf`.

### ⚡ Absolute Idempotency
Can be run 20 times in a row — result doesn't change.

### ⚡ Scalability
Per-day UID files ensure high performance.
