sans/   -- SANS parser package
   test.py -- SANS parsing example for NMR-STAR

INSTALL:
--------
sans parsers: simply copy sans subdirectory somewhere.

USE:
----

SANS:

Use ciftest.py and/or test.py as starting point.

if sans is a subdirectory in . : import sans
if sans is in /var/tmp/sans    : sys.path.append( "/var/tmp" )
                                 import sans

from sans import STARLexer
from sans import ErrorHandler, ContentHandler*
from sans import *parser
 -- pick the content handler and parser you want to use:
  parser/cifparser need ContentHandler, parser2 needs ContentHandler2

Finally, write a handler class with methods that'll do something useful 
with the data.

DOCUMENTATION:
--------------
SANS is modelled after SAX parsers, if you know how those work look up 
the *Handler classes in sans/handlers.py and you should be all set.

To generate SANS documentation you'll need ant. Run "ant javadoc" in java 
subdirectory, then  look in java/doc/api.

Java documentation is not 100% accurate for python version, but the
descriptions of handler classes and parser basics are close enough.
