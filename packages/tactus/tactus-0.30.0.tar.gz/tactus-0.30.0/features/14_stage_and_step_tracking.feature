Feature: Stage and Step Tracking
  As a workflow developer
  I want to track workflow progress through stages and steps
  So that I can monitor execution and provide status updates

  Background:
  Given a Tactus workflow environment
  And stage and step primitives are initialized

  Scenario: Defining workflow stages
  Given a workflow with stages:
  | stage_id  | name  |
  | stage1  | Data Collection  |
  | stage2  | Analysis  |
  | stage3  | Report Generation |
  When I begin stage "stage1"
  Then the current stage should be "Data Collection"
  And stage status should be "in_progress"

  Scenario: Completing stages in sequence
  Given a workflow with 3 stages
  When I complete stage 1
  And I begin stage 2
  Then stage 1 status should be "completed"
  And stage 2 status should be "in_progress"
  And stage 3 status should be "pending"

  Scenario: Tracking steps within a stage
  Given I am in stage "Analysis"
  When I begin Step "load_data"
  And I complete Step "load_data"
  And I begin Step "process_data"
  Then stage "Analysis" should show 2 steps
  And Step "load_data" should be completed
  And Step "process_data" should be in_progress

  Scenario: Stage progress percentage
  Given a stage with 10 steps
  When 7 steps are completed
  Then stage progress should be 70%

  Scenario: Nested stages
  Given a parent stage "Research"
  And child stages "Literature Review" and "Experiments"
  When I complete "Literature Review"
  Then parent stage progress should reflect child completion
  And parent should be 50% complete

  Scenario: Step timing and duration
  When I begin Step "expensive_operation"
  And 5 seconds pass
  And I complete Step "expensive_operation"
  Then step duration should be approximately 5 seconds
  And I can identify slow steps

  Scenario: Stage failure handling
  Given I am in stage "Processing"
  When a step fails with an error
  Then the stage should be marked as "failed"
  And the failure reason should be recorded
  And I can retry the stage or skip to next stage

  Scenario: Resuming workflow at specific stage
  Given a workflow that failed at stage "Analysis"
  When I resume the workflow
  Then it should restart from stage "Analysis"
  And completed stages should be skipped

  Scenario: Real-time progress updates
  Given a long-running workflow
  When stages and steps complete
  Then progress updates should be emitted
  And external systems can monitor status
