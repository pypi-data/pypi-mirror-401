# flac2mp3

Python-based CLI audio format converter specifically designed for FLAC to MP3 conversions.


### Install Package
```shell
pip install flac2mp3-cli
```

# Description

This program is a multi-threaded FLAC to MP3 converter. It can convert a single FLAC file, or it can convert multiple FLAC files in a directory. Non-FLAC files in the directory are copied without conversion. The metadata of the original FLAC files is maintained in the converted MP3 files.

## Usage

To run the program, use the following command:

```shell
flac2mp3 <input_path>
```

**Where:** `<input_path>` is the path to the FLAC file or directory of FLAC files to convert.

**With Optionals Arguments:** 

```
flac2mp3 <input_path> -t <thread_count> -o <output_path> -b <bitrate> -ow
```

- `-t <thread_count>` (optional) is the number of threads to use for conversion. If not provided, the program will use a default value.
- `-o <output_path>` (optional) is the path to the directory where the converted MP3 files (and copied non-FLAC files) should be saved. If not provided, the program will save the files in a default directory.
- `-b <bitrate>` (optional) is the bitrare of the mp3 file, from 1 to 5. Default is 5. (1: 96k, 2: 128k, 3: 192k, 4: 255k, 5: 320k)
- `--overwrite` / `-ow` (optional) is a flag that if enabled overwrites the output file if it already exists. 

### Converting a Single File

To convert a single FLAC file, provide the path to the file as the `<input_path>`:

```shell
flac2mp3 /path/to/your/file.flac
```

### Converting a Directory

To convert all FLAC files in a directory, provide the path to the directory as the `<input_path>`:

```shell
flac2mp3 /path/to/your/directory
```

All FLAC files in the directory (and its subdirectories) will be converted to MP3.

## Dependencies

This program uses the following Python packages:

- `alive_progress` for progress bars
- `concurrent.futures` for multi-threading
- `os` and `shutil` for file and directory operations
- `sys`, `time`, `subprocess` for system operations
- `argparse` for parsing the arguments from the command line
- `mutagen.flac` for converting the flac files metadata

Note: `ffmpeg` client must be installed on the machine, see: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html to install guide.

## About
This project was born out of a personal need. I needed a tool that could convert my extensive library of FLAC files to MP3 format all at once. This would allow me to enjoy my music collection on devices that don't support FLAC.

This is one of my first projects and I'm still learning, so feel free to correct me or suggest improvements.
