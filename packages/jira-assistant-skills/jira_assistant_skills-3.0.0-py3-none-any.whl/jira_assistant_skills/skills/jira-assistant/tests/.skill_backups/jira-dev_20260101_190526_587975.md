# JIRA Developer Integration Skill

Developer workflow integration for JIRA including Git, CI/CD, and release automation.

**Quick Start:** [Get started in 10 minutes](docs/QUICK_START.md)

## When to Use This Skill

Use this skill when you need to:

**Starting Development:**
- Generate standardized Git branch names from JIRA issues
- Create feature, bugfix, or hotfix branches with consistent naming

**During Development:**
- Extract JIRA issue keys from commit messages
- Link Git commits to JIRA issues via comments
- Log time and transition issues from commits (Smart Commits)

**Code Review:**
- Generate PR descriptions from JIRA issue details
- Link Pull Requests (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket) to JIRA issues

**CI/CD Integration:**
- Track builds and deployments in JIRA
- Auto-transition issues based on PR/deployment events
- Generate release notes from JIRA versions

**Troubleshooting:**
- Debug why Development Panel shows empty
- Fix Smart Commits not working
- Resolve PR linking issues

## Learning Path

### Phase 1: Core Git Integration (30-45 min)

Learn to automate Git workflow integration. Start here if you're new to JIRA-Git integration.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `create_branch_name.py` | Generate consistent branch names from issues |
| `parse_commit_issues.py` | Extract issue keys from commit messages |
| `link_commit.py` | Link commits to JIRA issues |
| `get_issue_commits.py` | Retrieve development information |

### Phase 2: Pull Request & CI/CD (45-60 min)

Integrate pull requests and deployment tracking. Prerequisites: Complete Phase 1 first.

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `link_pr.py` | Automatically link PRs to JIRA |
| `create_pr_description.py` | Generate PR descriptions from issues |

**Advanced:** See [CI/CD Integration Guide](docs/guides/ci-cd-integration.md) for pipeline setup.

### Recommended Starting Points

| Role | Start With |
|------|------------|
| Developer | Phase 1, try `create_branch_name.py` |
| Git Administrator | Phase 1, then Phase 2 |
| DevOps Engineer | Phase 2 CI/CD integration |
| Release Manager | Phase 2 deployment tracking |

## Scripts Overview

All scripts support `--help` for detailed usage. See [scripts/REFERENCE.md](scripts/REFERENCE.md) for complete options.

### Quick Examples

```bash
# Generate branch name
jira dev branch-name PROJ-123 --auto-prefix

# Extract issues from commits
git log --oneline -10 | jira dev parse-commits --from-stdin

# Generate PR description
jira dev pr-description PROJ-123 --include-checklist

# Link PR to issue
jira dev link-pr PROJ-123 --pr https://github.com/org/repo/pull/456
```

## Configuration

Requires JIRA credentials via environment variables:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `JIRA_SITE_URL` | Your JIRA instance URL |
| `JIRA_EMAIL` | Your JIRA email |
| `JIRA_API_TOKEN` | Your JIRA API token |

## Common Options

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--profile` | JIRA profile for multi-instance support |
| `--output` | Output format: text (default), json |
| `--help` | Show detailed help and examples |

## Exit Codes

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Error (validation, API, config) |
| 2 | Invalid arguments |
