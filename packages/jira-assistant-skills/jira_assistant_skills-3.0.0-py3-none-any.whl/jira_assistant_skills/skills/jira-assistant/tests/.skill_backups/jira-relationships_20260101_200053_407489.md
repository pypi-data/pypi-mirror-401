# jira-relationships

Issue linking and dependency management for JIRA - create, view, and analyze issue relationships.

## When to use this skill

Use this skill when you need to:
- Link issues together (blocks, duplicates, relates to, clones)
- View issue dependencies and blockers
- Find blocker chains and critical paths
- Analyze issue relationships and dependencies
- Get link statistics for issues or projects
- Bulk link multiple issues
- Clone issues with their relationships

## What this skill does

This skill provides issue relationship operations:

1. **Get Link Types**: View available link types in JIRA instance
   - Lists all configured link types
   - Shows inward/outward descriptions
   - Filter by name pattern

2. **Link Issues**: Create relationships between issues
   - Semantic flags for common types (--blocks, --relates-to, etc.)
   - Support for all JIRA link types
   - Optional comment on link creation
   - Dry-run mode for preview

3. **View Links**: See all relationships for an issue
   - Filter by direction (inward/outward)
   - Filter by link type
   - Shows linked issue status and summary

4. **Remove Links**: Delete issue relationships
   - Remove specific links between issues
   - Remove all links of a type
   - Dry-run and confirmation modes

5. **Blocker Analysis**: Find blocking dependencies
   - Direct blockers for an issue
   - Recursive blocker chain traversal
   - Circular dependency detection
   - Critical path identification

6. **Dependency Graphs**: Visualize relationships
   - Export to DOT format for Graphviz
   - Export to Mermaid diagrams
   - Export to PlantUML format
   - Export to D2 diagrams (Terrastruct)
   - Transitive dependency tracking

7. **Link Statistics**: Analyze link patterns
   - Stats for single issue or entire project
   - Link breakdown by type and direction
   - Find orphaned issues (no links)
   - Identify most-connected issues
   - Status distribution of linked issues

8. **Bulk Operations**: Link multiple issues at once
   - Link from JQL query results
   - Progress tracking
   - Skip existing links

9. **Clone Issues**: Duplicate issues with relationships
   - Copy fields to new issue
   - Create "clones" link to original
   - Optionally copy subtasks and links

## Available scripts

- `get_link_types.py` - List available link types
- `link_issue.py` - Create link between issues
- `get_links.py` - View links for an issue
- `unlink_issue.py` - Remove issue links
- `get_blockers.py` - Find blocker chain (recursive)
- `get_dependencies.py` - Find all dependencies
- `link_stats.py` - Analyze link statistics for issues/projects
- `bulk_link.py` - Bulk link multiple issues
- `clone_issue.py` - Clone issue with links

## Common Options

All scripts support these common options:

| Option | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `--profile PROFILE` | JIRA profile to use (default: from config) |
| `--output FORMAT` | Output format: text, json (some scripts also support mermaid, dot, plantuml, d2) |
| `--help` | Show help message and exit |

## Examples

### Quick Start - Common Operations

```bash
# View available link types in your JIRA instance
jira relationships link-types

# Create links using semantic flags
jira relationships link PROJ-1 --blocks PROJ-2
jira relationships link PROJ-1 --duplicates PROJ-2
jira relationships link PROJ-1 --relates-to PROJ-2

# View and remove links
jira relationships get-links PROJ-123
jira relationships unlink PROJ-1 --from PROJ-2

# Clone an issue with its relationships
jira relationships clone PROJ-123 --include-subtasks --include-links
```

### Advanced - Blocker Analysis & Statistics

```bash
# Find blocker chains for sprint planning
jira relationships get-blockers PROJ-123 --recursive --depth 3

# Project-wide link statistics (find orphans, hubs)
jira relationships stats --project PROJ --top 10

# Bulk link issues from JQL query
jira relationships bulk-link --jql "project=PROJ AND fixVersion=1.0" --relates-to PROJ-500 --dry-run
```

### Visualization - Dependency Graphs

```bash
# Export for documentation (Mermaid for GitHub/GitLab)
jira relationships get-dependencies PROJ-123 --output mermaid

# Export for publication (Graphviz)
jira relationships get-dependencies PROJ-123 --output dot > deps.dot
dot -Tpng deps.dot -o deps.png
```

## Exporting Dependency Graphs

Use `get_dependencies.py` with `--output` flag to generate diagrams:
- Formats: `text` (default), `json`, `mermaid` (GitHub docs), `dot` (Graphviz), `plantuml`, `d2`
- All formats include status-based coloring and link type labels
- Run `jira relationships get-dependencies --help` for rendering instructions

## Link Types

Standard JIRA link types and when to use them:

| Link Type | Outward | Inward | When to Use |
|-----------|---------|--------|-------------|
| **Blocks** | blocks | is blocked by | Sequential dependencies: Task A must finish before B starts |
| **Duplicate** | duplicates | is duplicated by | Mark redundant issues; close the duplicate |
| **Relates** | relates to | relates to | General association; cross-team awareness |
| **Cloners** | clones | is cloned by | Issue templates; multi-platform variants |

**Link Direction:** When A blocks B, A is "outward" (blocks) and B is "inward" (is blocked by).
Use `--blocks` when source issue blocks target; use `--is-blocked-by` when source is blocked by target.

**Note:** Issue links are labels only - they do not enforce workflow rules. Combine with automation or team discipline.

## Exit Codes

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 0 | Success |
| 1 | Error (validation failed, API error, or issue not found) |

## Troubleshooting

### "Issue does not exist" error
- Verify the issue key format is correct (e.g., PROJ-123)
- Check that you have permission to view the issue
- Confirm the project exists in your JIRA instance

### "Link type not found" error
- Run `get_link_types.py` to see available link types
- Link type names are case-sensitive in some JIRA instances
- Custom link types may have different names than standard ones

### "Permission denied" when creating links
- Ensure you have "Link Issues" permission in the project
- Some projects may restrict who can create certain link types

### Bulk link operations timing out
- Reduce the number of issues in a single operation
- Use `--max-results` to limit JQL query results
- Consider breaking large operations into smaller batches

### Clone operation fails
- Verify you have "Create Issues" permission in the target project
- Check that required fields for the target project are satisfied
- Some fields may not be cloneable (e.g., custom field restrictions)

### Circular dependency detected
- The `get_blockers.py` script automatically detects and reports cycles
- Review the blocker chain to identify and break the cycle
- Consider whether the blocking relationship is correctly modeled

## Configuration

Requires JIRA credentials via environment variables (`JIRA_SITE_URL`, `JIRA_EMAIL`, `JIRA_API_TOKEN`).
