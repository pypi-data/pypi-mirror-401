# Team Container Configuration - Private Registry Example
# ========================================================
#
# This example shows how to configure a team container for
# publishing to a private registry (Harbor, Nexus, GitLab, etc.)
#
# Workflow:
#   1. Edit this file with your team's packages
#   2. Create a git tag: git tag v1.0.0
#   3. Publish: ./scripts/publish-to-registry.sh -c team-config.yaml -r harbor.company.com
#
# Team members then pull with:
#   docker pull harbor.company.com/platform/dev-container:1.0.0

# Image settings
image:
  # Base image (use enhanced for full tooling)
  base: grandcamel/claude-devcontainer:enhanced

  # Image name (without registry prefix - added by publish script)
  # This becomes: harbor.company.com/platform/dev-container
  name: platform/dev-container

  # Default tag (overridden by git tag during publish)
  tag: latest

certificate:
  file: corporate-ca.crt
