# Placeholder file for conditional certificate injection
# This file is used when no extra CA certificates are needed
#
# To add Zscaler or other corporate CA certificates:
#   docker build --build-arg EXTRA_CA_CERT=path/to/zscaler.crt .
#
# The certificate will be added to the system trust store before
# any network operations (apt-get, npm, pip) occur.
