# Pointing Tool Wrapper

A JUICE SOC [Pointing Tool](https://juicept.esac.esa.int/) wrapper (`PTwrapper`) for WINDOWS, LINUX, and MACOSX to be 
used in a local computer.

Allows to simulate a Pointing Timeline Request (PTR) and to generate the corresponding SPICE CK, resolved PTR, 
available Power, and quaternions dump file.

`PTWrapper` is based on OSVE and mainly provides a shortcut to use the required functionalities and setup limited
to simulate PTRs. You can find more information on OSVE [here](https://juigitlab.esac.esa.int/core-system/uplink/phs/osve).


### Documentation

There is not PTWrapper specific documentation besides this README file. But extensive documentation on OSVE and on
the Pointing Tool exists as provided hereunder:

- [JUICE SOC Toolkit Help Pointing Tool](https://juicesoc.esac.esa.int/help/pdt/).
- [JUICE SOC Toolkit Help OSVE](https://juicesoc.esac.esa.int/help/osve/)


#### Pointing Request Log

The only particulars worth mentioning that are not present in the help of the PTWrapper API is the fact that the
PTWrapper generates a special log file that is designed to help the Pointing Design process.

This log is provided as an HTML and as a JSON file. The HTML can be visualized directly with any web browser whereas
the JSON file can be used to plug it in other tools (such as the Pointing Tool web app itself.)

This log provides a list of Attitude simulation WARNINGS and ERRORS sorted per designer instrument. It also includes the
errors that happen during the slew block before or after a given pointing block.


#### A Note on Eclipses

An eclipse will result in a reduction of the solar arrays available power.

By design, the JUICE SOC Attitude Generator Module (AGM), integrated in OSVE does not calculate eclipses (i.e. when
a body is in between JUICE and the Sun), instead eclipses are provided via an event file that is trajectory dependent. 
These event files are available for the trajectories in use. The trajectory is identified by PTWrapper by searching
for the SPICE frames kernel thar provides trajectory events in the used meta-kernel; because of this it is
extremely recommended to always use the meta-kernels provided by the JUICE SOC.


## Installation

```shx
pip install ptwrapper
```

## Development and testing

* Clone this repository
* Requirements:
  * Python 3.7+
* Create a virtual environment and install the dependencies

```shx
pip install -e .
```

Run the tests with in the `tests` directory with:

```shell
python3 -m unittest
```


## Using the library

After installing the library can be used with its CLI or with the Python Shell.


### Command line interface (recommended)

The package has a CLI entry point:

```shell
  ptwrapper -h
usage: ptwrapper [-h] [-m META_KERNEL] [-p PTR] [-w WORKING_DIR] [-o OUTPUT_DIR] [-t TIME_STEP] [-np] [-sa] [-mga] [-q] [-f] [-v]

Pointing Tool Wrapper (PTWrapper) simulates a PTR and generates the corresponding resolved PTR, SPICE CK kernels, and other attitude related files. PTWrapper uses OSVE to
simulate the PTR.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -m META_KERNEL, --meta-kernel META_KERNEL
                        [MANDATORY] Path to the SPICE Meta-kernel (MK) file
  -p PTR, --ptr PTR     [MANDATORY] Path to the Pointing Timeline Request (PTR) file.
  -w WORKING_DIR, --working-dir WORKING_DIR
                        Path to the working directory. Default is the current directory.
  -o OUTPUT_DIR, --output-dir OUTPUT_DIR

                        Simulation time step in seconds. Default is 5s.
  -pw, --power          Calculate the available power and compare it with the one generated from the SPICE meta-kernel. Default is that the Available Power is not calculated.
  -sa, --sa-ck          Generate the Solar Arrays SPICE CK.
  -mga, --mga-ck        Generate the Medium Gain Antenna SPICE CK.
  -q, --quaternions     Calculate the quaternions.
  -ro, --remove-obs-comp
                        Remove the observation compatibility checks from the simulation.
  -rc, --remove-checks  Remove all the constraint and observation compatibility checks from the simulation (enhances performance).
  -f, --fixed-definitions
                        Print the AGM Fixed Definitions in use for PTR design.
  -d, --debug           Keep all setup files of the OSVE simulation.
  -v, --version         Print OSVE, AGM, and EPS libraries version.
```

This will generate the following output files.

```shell
.

|-- ptr_test_osve_log.json
|-- ptr_test_power.csv
`-- ptr_test_resolved.ptx
```

### Python Shell

A basic test of the library for a PTR processing is provided. The sample creates in the working directory a structure 
folder to invoke the execution and dumps inside the OUTPUT folder the expected products (SPICE CK, resolved PTR, 
available Power, and quaternions CSV)

```
from ptwrapper import simulation

ptr_content = """<prm>
   <body>
      <segment>
         <data>
            <timeline frame="SC">
