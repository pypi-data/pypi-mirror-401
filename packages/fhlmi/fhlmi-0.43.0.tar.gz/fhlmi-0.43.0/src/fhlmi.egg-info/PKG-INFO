              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
              communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
              and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
              Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
              excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
              designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
        
              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

## Quick start

A simple example of how to use the library with default settings is shown below.

```python
from lmi import LiteLLMModel
from aviary.core import Message

llm = LiteLLMModel()

messages = [Message(content="What is the meaning of life?")]

result = await llm.call_single(messages)
# assert result.text == "42"
```

or, if you only have one user message, just:

```python
from lmi import LiteLLMModel

llm = LiteLLMModel()
result = await llm.call_single("What is the meaning of life?")
# assert result.text == "42"
```

## Documentation

### LLMs

An LLM is a class that inherits from `LLMModel` and implements the following methods:

- `async acompletion(messages: list[Message], **kwargs) -> list[LLMResult]`
- `async acompletion_iter(messages: list[Message], **kwargs) -> AsyncIterator[LLMResult]`

These methods are used by the base class `LLMModel` to implement the LLM interface.
Because `LLMModel` is an abstract class, it doesn't depend on any specific LLM provider.
All the connection with the provider is done in the subclasses using `acompletion` and `acompletion_iter` as interfaces.

Because these are the only methods that communicate with the chosen LLM provider,
we use an abstraction [LLMResult](https://github.com/Future-House/ldp/blob/main/packages/lmi/src/lmi/types.py#L35)
to hold the results of the LLM call.

#### LLMModel

An `LLMModel` implements `call`, which receives a list of `aviary` `Message`s and returns a list of `LLMResult`s.
`LLMModel.call` can receive callbacks, tools, and output schemas to control its behavior, as better explained below.
Because we support interacting with the LLMs using `Message` objects, we can use the modalities available in `aviary`,
which currently include text and images.
`lmi` supports these modalities but does not support other modalities yet.
Adittionally, `LLMModel.call_single` can be used to return a single `LLMResult` completion.

#### LiteLLMModel

`LiteLLMModel` wraps `LiteLLM` API usage within our `LLMModel` interface.
It receives a `name` parameter,
which is the name of the model to use and a `config` parameter,
which is a dictionary of configuration options for the model following the
[LiteLLM configuration schema](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/routing).
Common parameters such as `temperature`, `max_token`, and `n` (the number of completions to return)
can be passed as part of the `config` dictionary.

```python
import os
from lmi import LiteLLMModel

config = {
    "model_list": [
        {
            "model_name": "gpt-4o",
            "litellm_params": {
                "model": "gpt-4o",
                "api_key": os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY"),
                "frequency_penalty": 1.5,
                "top_p": 0.9,
                "max_tokens": 512,
                "temperature": 0.1,
                "n": 5,
            },
        }
    ]
}

llm = LiteLLMModel(name="gpt-4o", config=config)
```

`config` can also be used to pass common parameters directly for the model.

```python
from lmi import LiteLLMModel

config = {
    "name": "gpt-4o",
    "temperature": 0.1,
    "max_tokens": 512,
    "n": 5,
}

llm = LiteLLMModel(config=config)
```

### Cost tracking

Cost tracking is supported in two different ways:

1. Calls to the LLM return the token usage for each call in `LLMResult.prompt_count` and `LLMResult.completion_count`.
   Additionally, `LLMResult.cost` can be used to get a cost estimate for the call in USD.
2. A global cost tracker is maintained in `GLOBAL_COST_TRACKER`
   and can be enabled or disabled using `enable_cost_tracking()` and `cost_tracking_ctx()`.

### Rate limiting

Rate limiting helps regulate the usage of resources to various services and LLMs.
The rate limiter supports both in-memory and Redis-based storage for cross-process rate limiting.
Currently, `lmi` take into account the tokens used (Tokens per Minute (TPM))
and the requests handled (Requests per Minute (RPM)).

#### Basic Usage

Rate limits can be configured in two ways:

1. Through the LLM configuration:

   ```python
   from lmi import LiteLLMModel

   config = {
       "rate_limit": {
           "gpt-4": "100/minute",  # 100 tokens per minute
       },
       "request_limit": {
           "gpt-4": "5/minute",  # 5 requests per minute
       },
   }

   llm = LiteLLMModel(name="gpt-4", config=config)
   ```

   With `rate_limit` we rate limit only token consumption,
   and with `request_limit` we rate limit only request volume.
   You can configure both of them or only one of them as you need.

2. Through the global rate limiter configuration:

   ```python
   from lmi.rate_limiter import GLOBAL_LIMITER

   GLOBAL_LIMITER.rate_config[("client", "gpt-4")] = "100/minute"  # tokens per minute
   GLOBAL_LIMITER.rate_config[("client|request", "gpt-4")] = (
       "5/minute"  # requests per minute
   )
   ```

   With `client` we rate limit only token consumption,
   and with `client|request` we rate limit only request volume.
   You can configure both of them or only one of them as you need.

#### Rate Limit Format

Rate limits can be specified in two formats:

1. As a string: `"<count> [per|/] [n (optional)] <second|minute|hour|day|month|year>"`

   ```python
   "100/minute"  # 100 tokens per minute

   "5 per second"  # 5 tokens per second
   "1000/day"  # 1000 tokens per day
   ```

2. Using RateLimitItem classes:

   ```python
   from limits import RateLimitItemPerSecond, RateLimitItemPerMinute

   RateLimitItemPerSecond(30, 1)  # 30 tokens per second
   RateLimitItemPerMinute(1000, 1)  # 1000 tokens per minute
   ```

#### Storage Options

The rate limiter supports two storage backends:

1. In-memory storage (default when Redis is not configured):

   ```python
   from lmi.rate_limiter import GlobalRateLimiter

   limiter = GlobalRateLimiter(use_in_memory=True)
   ```

2. Redis storage (for cross-process rate limiting):

   ```python
   # Set REDIS_URL environment variable
   import os

   os.environ["REDIS_URL"] = "localhost:6379"

   from lmi.rate_limiter import GlobalRateLimiter

   limiter = GlobalRateLimiter()  # Will automatically use Redis if REDIS_URL is set
   ```

   This `limiter` can be used in within the `LLMModel.check_rate_limit` method
   to check the rate limit before making a request,
   similarly to how it is done in the [`LiteLLMModel` class][1].

#### Monitoring Rate Limits

You can monitor current rate limit status:

```python
from lmi.rate_limiter import GLOBAL_LIMITER
from lmi import LiteLLMModel
from aviary.core import Message

config = {
    "rate_limit": {
        "gpt-4": "100/minute",  # 100 tokens per minute
    },
    "request_limit": {
        "gpt-4": "5/minute",  # 5 requests per minute
    },
}

llm = LiteLLMModel(name="gpt-4", config=config)
results = await llm.call([Message(content="Hello, world!")])  # Consume some tokens

status = await GLOBAL_LIMITER.rate_limit_status()

# Example output:
{
    ("client|request", "gpt-4"): {  # the limit status for requests
        "period_start": 1234567890,
        "n_items_in_period": 1,
        "period_seconds": 60,
        "period_name": "minute",
        "period_cap": 5,
    },
    ("client", "gpt-4"): {  # the limit status for tokens
        "period_start": 1234567890,
        "n_items_in_period": 50,
        "period_seconds": 60,
        "period_name": "minute",
        "period_cap": 100,
    },
}
```

#### Timeout Configuration

The default timeout for rate limiting is 60 seconds, but can be configured:

```python
import os

os.environ["RATE_LIMITER_TIMEOUT"] = "30"  # 30 seconds timeout
```

#### Weight-based Rate Limiting

Rate limits can account for different weights (e.g., token counts for LLM requests):

```python
await GLOBAL_LIMITER.try_acquire(
    ("client", "gpt-4"),
    weight=token_count,  # Number of tokens in the request
    acquire_timeout=30.0,  # Optional timeout override
)
```

### Tool calling

LMI supports function calling through tools, which are functions that the LLM can invoke.
Tools are passed to `LLMModel.call` or `LLMModel.call_single`
as a list of [`Tool` objects from `aviary`][2],
along with an optional `tool_choice` parameter that controls how the LLM uses these tools.

[2]: https://github.com/Future-House/aviary/blob/1a50b116fb317c3ef27b45ea628781eb53c0b7ae/src/aviary/tools/base.py#L334

The `tool_choice` parameter follows `OpenAI`'s definition. It can be:

| Tool Choice Value               | Constant                           | Behavior                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `"none"`                        | `LLMModel.NO_TOOL_CHOICE`          | The model will not call any tools and instead generates a message              |
| `"auto"`                        | `LLMModel.MODEL_CHOOSES_TOOL`      | The model can choose between generating a message or calling one or more tools |
| `"required"`                    | `LLMModel.TOOL_CHOICE_REQUIRED`    | The model must call one or more tools                                          |
| A specific `aviary.Tool` object | N/A                                | The model must call this specific tool                                         |
| `None`                          | `LLMModel.UNSPECIFIED_TOOL_CHOICE` | No tool choice preference is provided to the LLM API                           |

When tools are provided, the LLM's response will be wrapped in a `ToolRequestMessage` instead of a regular `Message`.
The key differences are:

- `Message` represents a basic chat message with a role (system/user/assistant) and content
- `ToolRequestMessage` extends `Message` to include `tool_calls`, which contains a list of `ToolCall` objects,
  which contains the tools the LLM chose to invoke and their arguments

Further details about how to define a tool,
use the `ToolRequestMessage` and the `ToolCall` objects can be found in the
[Aviary documentation](https://github.com/Future-House/aviary?tab=readme-ov-file#tool).

Here is a minimal example usage:

```python
from lmi import LiteLLMModel
from aviary.core import Message, Tool
import operator


# Define a function that will be used as a tool
def calculator(operation: str, x: float, y: float) -> float:
    """
    Performs basic arithmetic operations on two numbers.

    Args:
        operation (str): The arithmetic operation to perform ("+", "-", "*", or "/")
        x (float): The first number
        y (float): The second number

    Returns:
        float: The result of applying the operation to x and y

    Raises:
        KeyError: If operation is not one of "+", "-", "*", "/"
        ZeroDivisionError: If operation is "/" and y is 0
    """
    operations = {
        "+": operator.add,
        "-": operator.sub,
        "*": operator.mul,
        "/": operator.truediv,
    }
    return operations[operation](x, y)


# Create a tool from the calculator function
calculator_tool = Tool.from_function(calculator)

# The LLM must use the calculator tool
llm = LiteLLMModel()
result = await llm.call_single(
    messages=[Message(content="What is 2 + 2?")],
    tools=[calculator_tool],
    tool_choice=LiteLLMModel.TOOL_CHOICE_REQUIRED,
)

# result.messages[0] will be a ToolRequestMessage with tool_calls containing
# the calculator invocation with x=2, y=2, operation="+"
```

### Vertex

Vertex requires a bit of extra set-up. First, install the extra dependency for auth:

```sh
pip install google-api-python-client
```

and then you need to configure which region/project you're using for the model calls.
Make sure you're authed for that region/project. Typically that means running:

```sh
gcloud auth application-default login
```

Then you can use vertex models:

```py
from lmi import LiteLLMModel
from aviary.core import Message

vertex_config = {"vertex_project": "PROJECT_ID", "vertex_location": "REGION"}

llm = LiteLLMModel(name="vertex_ai/gemini-2.5-pro", config=vertex_config)
await llm.call_single("hey")
```

### Embedding models

This client also includes embedding models.
An embedding model is a class that inherits from `EmbeddingModel`
and implements the `embed_documents` method,
which receives a list of strings
and returns a list with a list of floats (the embeddings) for each string.

Currently, the following embedding models are supported:

- `LiteLLMEmbeddingModel`
- `SparseEmbeddingModel`
- `SentenceTransformerEmbeddingModel`
- `HybridEmbeddingModel`

#### LiteLLMEmbeddingModel

`LiteLLMEmbeddingModel` provides a wrapper around LiteLLM's embedding functionality.
It supports various embedding models through the LiteLLM interface,
with automatic dimension inference and token limit handling.
It defaults to `text-embedding-3-small` and can be configured with `name` and `config` parameters.
Notice that `LiteLLMEmbeddingModel` can also be rate limited.

```python
from lmi import LiteLLMEmbeddingModel

model = LiteLLMEmbeddingModel(
    name="text-embedding-3-small",
    config={"rate_limit": "100/minute", "batch_size": 16},
)

embeddings = await model.embed_documents(["text1", "text2", "text3"])
```

#### HybridEmbeddingModel

`HybridEmbeddingModel` combines multiple embedding models by concatenating their outputs.
It is typically used to combine a dense embedding model (like `LiteLLMEmbeddingModel`)
with a sparse embedding model for improved performance.
The model can be created in two ways:

```python
from lmi import LiteLLMEmbeddingModel, SparseEmbeddingModel, HybridEmbeddingModel

dense_model = LiteLLMEmbeddingModel(name="text-embedding-3-small")
sparse_model = SparseEmbeddingModel()
hybrid_model = HybridEmbeddingModel(models=[dense_model, sparse_model])
```

The resulting embedding dimension will be the sum of the dimensions of all component models.
For example, if you combine a 1536-dimensional dense embedding with a 256-dimensional sparse embedding,
the final embedding will be 1792-dimensional.

#### SentenceTransformerEmbeddingModel

You can also use `sentence-transformer`,
which is a local embedding library with support for HuggingFace models,
by installing `lmi[local]`.
