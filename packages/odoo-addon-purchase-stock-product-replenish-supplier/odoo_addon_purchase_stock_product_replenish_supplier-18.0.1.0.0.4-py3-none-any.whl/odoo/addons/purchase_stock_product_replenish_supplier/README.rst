Set default supplier on product "Replenish" wizard.

When an orderpoint exists, odoo doesn't set the default supplier in the
"Replenish" wizard if not set on the orderpoint. But it is not required
to set a supplier on an orderpoint (the field is even hidden by
default), it will default to the main product supplier.

.. IMPORTANT::
   This is an alpha version, the data model and design can change at any time without warning.
   Only for development or testing purpose, do not use in production.
