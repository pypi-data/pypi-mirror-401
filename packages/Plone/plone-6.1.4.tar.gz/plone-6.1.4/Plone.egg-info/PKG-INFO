<h2 align="center">
Technical overview
</h2>

Plone is a content management platform with its backend written in Python.
Plone has a choice of frontend, either Classic UI using server-side templates or Volto written in modern React-based JavaScript.
It builds upon Zope, an open source web application server and development system, and thus on the pluggable Zope Component Architecture (ZCA).

Python is the easy to learn, widely used, and supported open source programming language.
Python can be used to add new features to Plone and used to understand or make changes to the way that Plone works.

Plone stores its contents in Zope's built-in transactional hierarchical object database, the ZODB.
The ZODB can be connected to simple file-storages, scalable ZEO-Servers or Postgres, MySQL, and Oracle.
There are add-ons and techniques, however, to share information with other sources, such as relational databases, LDAP, filesystem
files, and so on.
