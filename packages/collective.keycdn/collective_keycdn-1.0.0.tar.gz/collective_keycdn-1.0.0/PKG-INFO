=================
collective.keycdn
=================

A Plone addon for purging a KeyCDN cache on content changes.

Features
--------

This package overrides the plone.cachepurging utility to send purge requests to KeyCDN, a commercial content delivery network.

It works with the existing caching control panel and a separate add-on control panel for providing api keys and zone configuration information.

Documentation
-------------

This package only works if you have a working plone caching setup. It does not automatically purge content on its own.

Once your caching configuration is in place and you have activated the addon, go to the KeyCDN add on control panel and put in your KeyCDN api key and provide the list of zones and urls to purge.

You can enter multiple zones/sites and each purge will be repeated for each zone.


Installation
------------

Install collective.keycdn by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        collective.keycdn


and then running ``bin/buildout``

Once you have installed the package you can enable the addon via the 'Add-ons' control panel.
