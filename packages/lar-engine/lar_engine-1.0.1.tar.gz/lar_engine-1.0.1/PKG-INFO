# Lár: The PyTorch for Agents



**Lár** (Irish for "core" or "center") is the open source standard for **Deterministic, Auditable, and Air-Gap Capable** AI agents.

It is a **"define-by-run"** framework that acts as a **Flight Recorder** for your agent, creating a complete audit trail for every single step.

> [!NOTE]
> **Lár is NOT a wrapper.**
> It is a standalone, ground-up engine designed for reliability. It does not wrap LangChain, OpenAI Swarm, or any other library. It is pure, dependency-lite Python code optimized for "Code-as-Graph" execution.

## The "Black Box" Problem

You are a developer launching a **mission-critical AI agent**. It works on your machine, but in production, it fails.
You don't know **why**, **where**, or **how much** it cost. You just get a 100-line stack trace from a "magic" framework.

## The "Glass Box" Solution

**Lár removes the magic.**

It is a simple engine that runs **one node at a time**, logging every single step to a forensic **Flight Recorder**.

This means you get:
1.  **Instant Debugging**: See the exact node and error that caused the crash.
2.  **Free Auditing**: A complete history of every decision and token cost, built-in by default.
3.  **Total Control**: Build deterministic "assembly lines," not chaotic chat rooms.

> *"This demonstrates that for a graph without randomness or external model variability, Lár executes deterministically and produces identical state traces."*

*Stop guessing. Start building agents you can trust.*



## Why Lár is Better: The "Glass Box" Advantage

| Feature | The "Black Box" (LangChain / CrewAI) | The "Glass Box" (Lár) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Debugging** | **A Nightmare.** When an agent fails, you get a 100-line stack trace from inside the framework's "magic" AgentExecutor. You have to guess what went wrong. | **Instant & Precise.** Your history log is the debugger. You see the exact node that failed (e.g., `ToolNode`), You see the exact error (`APIConnectionError`), and the exact state that caused it. |
| **Auditability** | **External & Paid.** "What happened?" is a mystery. You need an external, paid tool like LangSmith to add a "flight recorder" to your "black box." | **Built-in & Free.** The **"Flight Log"** (history log) is the core, default, open-source output of the `GraphExecutor`. You built this from day one. |
| **Multi-Agent Collaboration** | **Chaotic "Chat Room."** Agents are put in a room to "talk" to each other. It's "magic," but it's uncontrollable. You can't be sure who will talk next or if they'll get stuck in a loop. | **Deterministic "Assembly Line."** You are the architect. You define the exact path of collaboration using `RouterNode` and `ToolNode`. |
| **Deterministic Control** | **None.** You can't guarantee execution order. The "Tweeter" agent might run before the "Researcher" agent is finished. | **Full Control.** The "Tweeter" (`LLMNode`) cannot run until the "RAG Agent" (`ToolNode`) has successfully finished and saved its result to the state. |
| **Data Flow** | **Implicit & Messy.** Agents pass data by "chatting." The `ToolNode`'s output might be polluted by another agent's "thoughts." | **Explicit & Hard-Coded.** The data flow is defined by you: `RAG Output -> Tweet Input`. The "Tweeter" only sees the data it's supposed to. |
| **Resilience & Cost** | **Wasteful & Brittle.** If the RAG agent fails, the Tweeter agent might still run with no data, wasting API calls and money. A loop of 5 agents all chatting can hit rate limits fast. | **Efficient & Resilient.** If the RAG agent fails, the Tweeter never runs. Your graph stops, saving you money and preventing a bad output. Your `LLMNode`'s built-in retry handles transient errors silently. |
| **Core Philosophy** | Sells "Magic." | Sells "Trust." |

## Universal Model Support: Powered by LiteLLM

**Lár runs on 100+ Providers.**
Because Lár is built on the robust **[LiteLLM](https://docs.litellm.ai/docs/)** adapter, you are not locked into one vendor.

Start with **OpenAI** for prototyping. Deploy with **Azure/Bedrock** for compliance. Switch to **Ollama** for local privacy. All with **Zero Refactoring**.

| **Task** | **LangChain / CrewAI** | **Lár (The Unified Way)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Switching Providers** | 1. Import new provider class.<br>2. Instantiate specific object.<br>3. Refactor logic. | **Change 1 string.**<br>`model="gpt-4o"` → `model="ollama/phi4"` |
| **Code Changes** | **High.** `ChatOpenAI` vs `ChatBedrock` classes. | **Zero.** The API contract is identical for every model. |

**[Read the Full LiteLLM Setup Guide](https://docs.snath.ai/guides/litellm_setup/)** to learn how to configure:
-   **Local Models** (Ollama, Llama.cpp, LocalAI)
-   **Cloud Providers** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Vertex, Bedrock, Azure)
-   **Advanced Config** (Temperature, API Base, Custom Headers)

```python
# Want to save money? Switch to local.
# No imports to change. No logic to refactor.

# Before (Cloud)
node = LLMNode(model_name="gpt-4o", ...)

# After (Local - Ollama)
node = LLMNode(model_name="ollama/phi4", ...)

# After (Local - Generic Server)
node = LLMNode(
    model_name="openai/custom",
    generation_config={"api_base": "http://localhost:8080/v1"}
)
```

## The Game Changer: Hybrid Cognitive Architecture

**Most frameworks are "All LLM." This doesn't scale.**
You cannot run 1,000 agents if every step costs $0.05 and takes 3 seconds.

### 1. The "Construction Site" Metaphor

*   **The Old Way (Standard Agents):**
    Imagine a construction site where **every single worker is a high-paid Architect**. To hammer a nail, they stop, "think" about the nail, write a poem about the nail, and charge you $5. It takes forever and costs a fortune.

*   **The Lár Way (Hybrid Swarm):**
    Imagine **One Architect** and **1,000 Robots**.
    1.  **The Architect (Orchestrator Node)**: Looks at the blueprint ONCE. Yells: *"Build the Skyscraper!"*
    2.  **The Robots (Swarm)**: They hear the order. They don't "think." They don't charge $5. They just **execute** thousands of steps instantly.

### 2. The Numbers Don't Lie

We prove this in **[`examples/9_corporate_swarm.py`](examples/9_corporate_swarm.py)**.

| Feature | Standard "Agent Builder" (LangChain/CrewAI) | Lár "Hybrid" Architecture |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logic** | 100% LLM Nodes. Every step is a prompt. | **1% LLM (Orchestrator) + 99% Code (Swarm)** |
| **Cost** | **$$$** (60 LLM calls). | **$** (1 LLM call). |
| **Speed** | **Slow** (60s+ latency). | **Instant** (0.08s for 64 steps). |
| **Reliability** | **Low**. "Telephone Game" effect. | **High**. Deterministic execution. |

### 3. Case Study: The "Smoking Gun" Proof
We built the generic "Corporate Swarm" in massive-scale LangChain/LangGraph (`examples/comparisons/langchain_swarm_fail.py`) to compare.
**It crashed at Step 25.**

```text
-> Step 24
💥 CRASH CONFIRMED: Recursion limit of 25 reached without hitting a stop condition.
LangGraph Engine stopped execution due to Recursion Limit.
```

**Why this matters:**
1.  **The "Recursion Limit" Crash**: Standard executors treat agents as loops. They cap at 25 steps to prevent infinite loops. Real work (like a 60-step swarm) triggers this safety switch.
2.  **Clone the Patterns**: You don't need a framework. You need a pattern. We provide **21 single-file recipes** (Examples 1-21).
3.  **The "Token Burn"**: Standard frameworks use an LLM to route every step ($0.60/run). Lár uses code ($0.00/run).
4.  **The "Telephone Game"**: Passing data through 60 LLM layers corrupts context. Lár passes explicit state objects.

## The `Lár` Architecture: Core Primitives

You can build any agent with four core components:

1.  **`GraphState`**: A simple, unified object that holds the "memory" of the agent. It is passed to every node, allowing one node to write data (`state.set(...)`) and the next to read it (`state.get(...)`).

2.  **`BaseNode`**: The abstract class (the "contract") for all executable units. It enforces a single method: `execute(self, state)`. The `execute` method's sole responsibility is to perform its logic and return the *next* `BaseNode` to run, or `None` to terminate the graph.

3.  **`GraphExecutor`**: The "engine" that runs the graph. It is a Python generator that runs one node, yields the execution log for that step, and then pauses, waiting for the next call.

4.  **Node Implementations**: The "building blocks" of your agent.

      * **`LLMNode`**: The "Thinker." Calls any major LLM API (e.g., Gemini, GPT-4, Claude) to generate text... to generate text, modify plans, or correct code. **Now supports `generation_config` for controlling creativity (temperature, top_p).**
      * **`ToolNode`**: The "Actor." Executes any deterministic Python function (e.g., run code, search a database, call an API). It supports separate routing for `success` and `error`.
      * **`RouterNode`**: The "Choice." Executes a simple Python function to inspect the state and returns a string key, which deterministically routes execution to the next node. This is your "if/else" statement.
      * **`BatchNode`**: The "Parallelizer." Fan-out multiple nodes to run concurrently on separate threads, then merge their results (fan-in). Essential for speed.
      * **`HumanJuryNode`**: The "Article 14 Guard." Pauses execution and solicits explicit human approval via CLI before allowing the graph to proceed.
      * **`ClearErrorNode`**: A utility node that cleans up state (e.g., removes `last_error`) to prevent infinite loops.

## Example "Glass Box" Audit Trail

You don't need to guess why an agent failed. `lar` is a "glass box" that provides a complete, auditable log for every run, especially failures.

This is a **real execution** log from a lar-built agent. The agent's job was to run a "Planner" and then a "Synthesizer" (both LLMNodes). The GraphExecutor caught a fatal error, gracefully stopped the agent, and produced this perfect audit trail.

**Execution Summary (Run ID: a1b2c3d4-...)**
| Step | Node | Outcome | Key Changes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 0 | `LLMNode` | `success` | `+ ADDED: 'search_query'` |
| 1 | `ToolNode` | `success` | `+ ADDED: 'retrieved_context'` |
| 2 | `LLMNode` | `success` | `+ ADDED: 'draft_answer'` |
| 3 | `LLMNode` | **`error`** | **`+ ADDED: 'error': "APIConnectionError"`** |

**This is the `lar` difference.** You know the *exact* node (`LLMNode`), the *exact* step (3), and the *exact reason* (`APIConnectionError`) for the failure. You can't debug a "black box," but you can **always** fix a "glass box."


##  Just-in-Time Integrations

**Stop waiting for "HubSpot Support" to merge.**

Lár does not ship with 500+ brittle API wrappers. Instead, we ship the **Integration Builder**.

1.  **Drag** [`IDE_INTEGRATION_PROMPT.md`](IDE_INTEGRATION_PROMPT.md) into your AI Chat (Cursor/Windsurf).
2.  **Ask**: *"Make me a tool that queries the Stripe API for failed payments."*
3.  **Done**: You get a production-ready, type-safe `ToolNode` in 30 seconds.

 **[Read the Full Guide](https://docs.snath.ai/guides/integrations/)** | **[See Example](examples/16_integration_test.py)**


## Installation

This project is managed with [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/snath-ai/lar.git
    cd lar
    ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**
Lár uses the unified LiteLLM adapter under the hood. This means if a model is supported by LiteLLM (100+ providers including Azure, Bedrock, VertexAI), it is supported by Lár.

Create a `.env` file:

```bash
# Required for running Gemini models:
GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_KEY_HERE" 
# Required for running OpenAI models (e.g., gpt-4o):
OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_KEY_HERE"
# Required for running Anthropic models (e.g., Claude):
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="YOUR_ANTHROPIC_KEY_HERE"
```

3.  **Install dependencies:**
    This command creates a virtual environment and installs all packages from `pyproject.toml`.

    ```bash
    poetry install
    ```

## Ready to build with Lár? (Agentic IDEs)

Lár is designed for **Agentic IDEs** (Cursor, Windsurf, Antigravity) and strict code generation.

We provide a **3-Step Workflow** directly in the repo to make your IDE an expert Lár Architect.

### 1. The Strategy: "Reference, Don't Copy"
Instead of pasting massive prompts, simply **reference** the master files in the `lar/` directory.

### 2. The Workflow
1.  **Context (The Brain)**: In your IDE chat, reference `@lar/IDE_MASTER_PROMPT.md`. This loads the strict typing rules and "Code-as-Graph" philosophy.
2.  **Integrations (The Hands)**: Reference `@lar/IDE_INTEGRATION_PROMPT.md` to generate production-ready API wrappers in seconds.
3.  **Scaffold (The Ask)**: Open `@lar/IDE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md`, fill in your agent's goal, and ask the IDE to "Implement this."

**Example Prompt to Cursor/Windsurf:**
> "Using the rules in @lar/IDE_MASTER_PROMPT.md, implement the agent described in @lar/IDE_PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md."

### 2. Learn by Example
We have provided **18 robust patterns** in the **[`examples/`](examples/)** directory:

## Security Labs: Red Teaming Case Studies

We don't just build agents; we break them. These "Labs" demonstrate common failure modes in other frameworks and how Lár prevents them.

| ID | File | The Vulnerability |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Lab 1** | **[`22_context_contamination_test.py`](examples/22_context_contamination_test.py)** | **Context Contamination**: Using "Social Engineering" to trick an LLM Jury. (Lár blocks this). |
| **Lab 2** | **[`23_zombie_action_test.py`](examples/23_zombie_action_test.py)** | **Zombie Actions**: "Stale Authority" execution after a crash/resume. (Lár signatures prevent this). |

## Example: Multi-Agent Orchestration (A Customer Support Agent)

The *real* power of `lar` is not just loops, but **multi-agent orchestration.**

Other frameworks use a "chaotic chat room" model, where agents *talk* to each other and you *hope* for a good result. `lar` is a deterministic **"assembly line."** You are the architect. You build a "glass box" graph that routes a task to specialized agents, guaranteeing order and auditing every step.

### 1. The "Glass Box" Flowchart

This is the simple, powerful "Customer Support" agent we'll build. It's a "Master Agent" that routes tasks to specialists.

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B(LLMNode<br/>'Agent 1: Triage');
    B --> C(LLMNode<br/>'Agent 2: Planner');
    C --> D(ToolNode<br/>'Retriever');
    
    %% This is the "hub" node
    D --> E{RouterNode<br/>'Manager: Route By Category'};
    
    %% Define the three parallel paths
    E -- "BILLING_AGENT" --> F;
    E -- "TECH_AGENT" --> G;
    E -- "GENERAL_AGENT" --> H;

    %% Define what's INSIDE the subgraphs
    subgraph "Finance Department"
        F(LLMNode<br/>'Agent 3: Finance Specialist');
    end

    subgraph "Tech Support Department"
        G(LLMNode<br/>'Agent 4: Tech Specialist');
    end
    
    subgraph "General"
        H(LLMNode<br/>'Agent 5: Generalist');
    end

    %% Define the "join" point
    F --> I[AddValueNode<br/>'Final Answer'];
    G --> I;
    H --> I;
    I --> J[END];
```

## Lár Engine Architecture: The Multi-Agent Assembly Line

### The core of this application is a Multi-Agent Orchestration Graph. `Lár` forces you to define the assembly line, which guarantees predictable, auditable results.

## Compliance & Safety (EU AI Act Ready - Aug 2026)

Lár is engineered for **High-Risk AI Systems** under the **EU AI Act (2026)** and **FDA 21 CFR Part 11**.

| Regulation | Requirement | Lár Implementation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **EU AI Act Art. 12** | **Record-Keeping** | **State-Diff Ledger**: Automatically creates an immutable, forensic JSON log of every step, variable change, and model decision. |
| **EU AI Act Art. 13** | **Transparency** | **"Glass Box" Architecture**: No hidden prompts or "magic" loops. Every node is explicit code that can be audited by non-technical reviewers. |
| **EU AI Act Art. 14** | **Human Oversight** | **Interrupt Pattern**: Native support for "Human-in-the-Loop". Pause execution, modify state, and resume—ensuring human control over high-stakes decisions. |
| **FDA 21 CFR Part 11** | **Audit Trails** | **Cryptographic Determinism**: The engine is deterministic by design, ensuring reproducible runs for clinical validation. |

## Quick Start
### 1. Graph Flow (Execution Sequence)

The agent executes in a fixed, 6-step sequence. The graph is `defined backwards` in the code, but the execution runs forwards:

| Step        | Node Name         | Lár Primitive | Action                                                                                   | State Output       |
|-------------|-------------------|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------|
| 0 (Start)   | triage_node       | LLMNode       | Classifies the user's input (`{task}`) into a service category (BILLING, TECH, etc.).     | category           |
| 1           | planner_node      | LLMNode       | Converts the task into a concise, high-quality search query.                              | search_query       |
| 2           | retrieve_node     | ToolNode      | Executes the local FAISS vector search and retrieves the relevant context.                | retrieved_context  |
| 3           | specialist_router | RouterNode    | Decision point. Reads the category and routes the flow to the appropriate specialist.     | (No change; routing) |
| 4           | billing/tech_agent| LLMNode       | The chosen specialist synthesizes the final answer using the retrieved context.           | agent_answer       |
| 5 (End)     | final_node        | AddValueNode  | Saves the synthesized answer as `final_response` and terminates the graph.                | final_response     |

### 2. Architectural Primitives Used

This demo relies on the core Lár primitives to function:

- `LLMNode`: Used 5 times (Triage, Plan, and the 3 Specialists) for all reasoning and synthesis steps.

- `RouterNode`: Used once (specialist_router) for the deterministic if/else branching logic.

- `ToolNode`: Used once (retrieve_node) to securely execute the local RAG database lookup.

- `GraphExecutor`: The engine that runs this entire sequence and produces the complete audit log

### This is the full logic from `support_app.py`. It's just a clean, explicit Python script.

```python 
'''
====================================================================
    ARCHITECTURE NOTE: Defining the Graph Backwards
    
    The Lár Engine uses a "define-by-run" philosophy. Because a node 
    references the *next_node* object (e.g., next_node=planner_node),
    the nodes MUST be defined in Python in the REVERSE order of execution 
    to ensure the next object already exists in memory.
    
    Execution runs: START (Triage) -> END (Final)
    Definition runs: END (Final) -> START (Triage)
====================================================================

'''

## Ready to Build a Real Agent?
We have built two "killer demos" that prove this "glass box" model. You can clone, build, and run them today.

- **[snath-ai/DMN](https://github.com/snath-ai/DMN)**: **The Flagship Showcase.** A cognitive architecture with a "Bicameral Mind" (Fast/Slow) that sleeps, dreams, and consolidates long-term memory to solve catastrophic forgetting.

- **[`examples/21_access_control_agent.py`](examples/21_access_control_agent.py)**: **The Enterprise Flagship.** A "Juried Layer" demo that combines LLM Reasoning, Deterministic Policy, and Human-in-the-Loop Interrupts for secure infrastructure access.

- **[snath-ai/rag-demo](https://github.com/snath-ai/rag-demo)**: A complete, self-correcting RAG agent that uses a local vector database.

- **[snath-ai/customer-support-demo](https://github.com/snath-ai/customer-support-demo)**: The Customer Support agent described above.

- **[snath-ai/code-repair-demo](https://github.com/snath-ai/code-repair-demo)**: A Self-Healing CI/CD agent that writes tests, detects failures, and patches its own code in a loop.
