"Audit" specifies that a validation failure is included in the published audit event for the request. The audit event will contain a `validation.policy.admission.k8s.io/validation_failure` audit annotation with a value containing the details of the validation failures, formatted as a JSON list of objects, each with the following fields: - message: The validation failure message string - policy: The resource name of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy - binding: The resource name of the ValidatingAdmissionPolicyBinding - expressionIndex: The index of the failed validations in the ValidatingAdmissionPolicy - validationActions: The enforcement actions enacted for the validation failure Example audit annotation: `"validation.policy.admission.k8s.io/validation_failure": "[{\\"message\\": \\"Invalid value\\", {\\"policy\\": \\"policy.example.com\\", {\\"binding\\": \\"policybinding.example.com\\", {\\"expressionIndex\\": \\"1\\", {\\"validationActions\\": [\\"Audit\\"]}]"`  Clients should expect to handle additional values by ignoring any values not recognized.
