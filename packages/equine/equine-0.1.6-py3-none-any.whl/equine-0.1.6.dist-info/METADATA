## Usage
Deep neural networks (DNNs) for supervised labeling problems are known to
produce accurate results on a wide variety of learning tasks. However, when
accuracy is the only objective, DNNs frequently make over-confident predictions,
and they also always make a label prediction regardless of whether or not the
test data belongs to any known labels. 

EQUINE was created to simplify two kinds of uncertainty quantification for supervised labeling problems:
1) Calibrated probabilities for each predicted label
2) An in-distribution score, indicating whether any of the model's known labels should be trusted.
 
Dive into our [documentation examples](https://mit-ll-responsible-ai.github.io/equine/)
to get started. Additionally, we provide a [companion web application](https://github.com/mit-ll-responsible-ai/equine-webapp).

## Installation
Users are recommended to install a virtual environment such as Anaconda, as is also recommended
in the [pytorch installation](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch). EQUINE has relatively
few dependencies beyond torch. 
```console
pip install equine
```
Users interested in contributing should refer to `CONTRIBUTING.md` for details.

## Design
EQUINE extends pytorch's `nn.Module` interface using a `predict` method that returns both
the class predictions and the extra OOD scores.
