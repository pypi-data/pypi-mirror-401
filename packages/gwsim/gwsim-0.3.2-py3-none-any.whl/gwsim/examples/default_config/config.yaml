# Example configuration file for gwsim gravitational-wave data generator
# This file demonstrates how to configure simulations with noise and signal generators
# Template variables (e.g., {{ detectors }}) are expanded at runtime using simulator attributes

# Global configuration shared across all simulators
globals:
  # Simulator arguments that apply to all simulators unless overridden
  simulator-arguments:
    sampling-frequency: 4096 # Sampling rate in Hz (affects data quality and file size)
    duration: 1024 # Duration of each generated segment in seconds
    start-time: 1577491218 # GPS start time for the simulation
    total-duration: '5 hours' # Total simulation duration (parsed from string or numeric)
  # Directory paths (relative to working directory unless absolute)
  working-directory: . # Base directory for all operations
  output-directory: output # Where generated data files are saved
  metadata-directory: metadata # Where simulation metadata and checkpoints are stored

# List of simulators to run (each generates data independently)
simulators:
  # Example noise simulator configuration
  noise:
    class: ColoredNoiseSimulator # Full class path resolved via registry (e.g., gwsim.noise.ColoredNoiseSimulator)
    arguments:
      psd_file: ET_10_full_cryo_psd.txt # Power spectral density file for colored noise
      seed: 42 # Random seed for reproducible noise generation
      detectors: # List of detectors
        - ET1
    # Output configuration for this simulator
    output:
      file_name: '{{ detectors }}-NOISE_STRAIN-{{ start_time }}-{{ duration }}.gwf' # Template for output filename
      arguments:
        channel: '{{ detectors }}-STRAIN' # Channel name template for GWF frame writing
