def _perform_fast_marching(speed_map: np.ndarray, seed_points: np.ndarray) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Perform fast marching using scikit-fmm to compute distance maps.

    This function implements the Fast Marching Method to solve the Eikonal equation,
    which is used to distribute innervation centers optimally within the muscle cross-section.
    The method ensures that innervation centers are spaced as far apart as possible from
    each other, mimicking the natural distribution of motor unit territories.

    Parameters
    ----------
    speed_map : np.ndarray
        2D speed map (inverse of a density map) defining the propagation speed
        at each grid point. Higher values indicate faster propagation.
        Should be > 1e-10 for valid regions and ≤ 1e-10 for invalid regions.
    seed_points : np.ndarray
        Seed points as 2×N array where each column is a point [x, y].
        Uses 1-based indexing like MATLAB. These are the starting points
        for the distance computation.

    Returns
    -------
    np.ndarray
        Distance map from seed points. Each element represents the minimum
        distance to any of the seed points. Invalid regions (outside the
        circular muscle boundary) are set to -1e10.

    Notes
    -----
    This function is used internally by the muscle distribution algorithm
    to implement a greedy approach for placing innervation centers such that
    each new electrode_grid_center is placed at the location farthest from all previously
    placed centers.
    """

    # Initialize with large positive values (far from boundary)

        x, y = int(seed_points[0, i] - 1), int(seed_points[1, i] - 1)

        A value of 0.25 means the largest motor unit can innervate up to 25%
        of the total muscle cross-sectional area.
        Must be in range (0, 1].
    mean_conduction_velocity__m_per_s : float, default=4.2

        Default is set to 256.
    autorun : bool, default=False
        If True, automatically executes the complete muscle simulation pipeline: innervation distribution, muscle fiber generation, and fiber-to-motor unit assignment.
        If False, these steps must be called manually.

        Assign muscle fibers to motor neurons using biologically realistic principles.

        This method implements an assignment algorithm that balances
        multiple biological constraints:

        1. Proximity: Fibers closer to innervation centers are more likely to be assigned
        2. Territory size: Each motor unit has a target number of fibers based on its size
        3. Self-avoidance: Neighboring fibers avoid belonging to the same motor unit
        4. Gaussian territories: Fiber territories follow roughly Gaussian distributions

        The assignment uses a probabilistic approach where each fiber is assigned
        based on the posterior probability computed from prior probabilities (target
        fiber numbers) and likelihoods (spatial clustering with Gaussian territories).

        Parameters
        ----------
        n_neighbours : int, default 3
            Number of neighboring fibers to consider for self-avoiding phenomena.
            Higher values increase intermingling between motor units but may slow
            computation. Typical range: 2-5.
        conf : float, default 0.999
            Confidence interval that defines the relationship between innervation
            area and Gaussian distribution variance. Higher values create tighter,
            more compact territories. Should be between 0.9 and 0.999.
        n_jobs : int, default -2
            Number of parallel workers for out-of-circle coefficient computation.

            - n_jobs=-1: Use all CPU cores
            - n_jobs=-2: Use all cores except one (recommended, keeps system responsive)
            - n_jobs=-3: Use all cores except two
            - n_jobs=1: No parallelization
            - n_jobs=N: Use exactly N cores

        Notes
        -----
        The algorithm compensates for out-of-muscle effects by calculating how much
        of each motor unit's Gaussian distribution falls outside the circular muscle
        boundary and adjusting the in-muscle probabilities accordingly.

        The self-avoidance mechanism promotes realistic intermingling by reducing
        the probability of assigning a fiber to a motor unit if its neighbors are
        already assigned to that unit.

        Calculate the actual number of muscle fibers assigned to each motor unit.

        This property returns the final fiber counts after the assignment process,
        which may differ slightly from the desired counts due to the stochastic
        assignment algorithm and discrete fiber distribution.

        Returns
        -------
        np.ndarray
            Array of length n_motor_units where each element represents the actual
            number of muscle fibers assigned to the corresponding motor unit.
            The sum of all elements equals the total number of muscle fibers.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If muscle fiber assignment has not been completed yet.

        Examples
        --------
        >>> actual_counts = muscle.resulting_number_of_innervated_fibers
        >>> desired_counts = muscle.desired_number_of_innervated_fibers
        >>> print(f"Motor unit 0: desired {desired_counts[0]}, actual {actual_counts[0]}")

        Notes
        -----
        This property can be used to assess how well the assignment algorithm
        achieved the target fiber distribution. Large deviations may indicate
        the need to adjust assignment parameters or increase grid resolution.

        The innervation area is computed as the area of a circle that encompasses

        innervation center. This provides a measure of the spatial extent of each
        motor unit territory.

        The resulting areas may differ from desired areas due to the discrete nature
        of fiber assignment and the constraint of the circular muscle boundary.
        Motor units near the muscle periphery may have smaller actual areas than
        desired due to boundary effects.
