    Base class for all neural cell models in the spinal cord simulation.

    Provides common functionality for neuron identification, morphology construction,
    and basic cellular properties. All specific neuron types inherit from this class

    definition, and biophysics specification that are overridden by subclasses.

        Identifier for the pool/population this cell belongs to, by default None.

    Attributes
    ----------
    global__ID : int
        Globally unique identifier across all cell instances. Automatically assigned
        using a class-level counter to ensure uniqueness across simulation.

    Secondary muscle spindle afferent (Group II afferent).

    Models muscle spindle secondary endings that primarily respond to muscle
    length (tonic stretch) with less sensitivity to velocity compared to
    Ia afferents. These afferents contribute to postural reflexes and provide
    input to Group II interneurons in spinal reflex circuits.

    Uses Gamma renewal point process (inherited from AffIa) with lower ISI CV
    (3.6% vs 8.3%) reflecting more regular firing patterns.
    Inherits all functional properties from AffIa but with distinct class
    identification for network connectivity. Typically have higher recruitment
    thresholds and lower maximum firing rates compared to Ia afferents.

    Parameters
    ----------
    RT : float
        Recruitment threshold for activation.
    N : int
        Maximum firing rate in Hz.
    pool__ID : int, optional

    Notes

    Physiologically, Group II afferents have:
    - Higher recruitment thresholds than Ia afferents
    - Lower maximum firing rates (~50-80 Hz vs 100+ Hz)
