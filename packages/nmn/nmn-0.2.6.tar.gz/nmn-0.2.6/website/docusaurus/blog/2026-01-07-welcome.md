# Welcome to Neural Matter Networks Documentation

We're excited to launch the official documentation site for Neural Matter Networks (NMN) — a fundamentally new approach to neural computation through the **ⵟ-product**.

## What's New

### Documentation Site

This new documentation site provides:

- **API Reference**: Comprehensive documentation for all NMN modules
- **Tutorials**: Step-by-step guides for common use cases
- **Examples**: Complete code examples for MNIST, CIFAR-10, and Transformers

### Flax NNX Support

NMN now fully supports **Flax NNX**, the modern pytree-based API for Flax:

```python
from nmn.nnx.nmn import YatNMN

layer = YatNMN(in_features=768, out_features=256, rngs=nnx.Rngs(0))
```

## Getting Started

Check out our [Introduction](/docs/intro) to learn about the ⵟ-product and how it enables activation-free neural computation.

## Interactive Paper

Don't forget to explore our [Interactive Paper](/paper/) with visualizations demonstrating the geometric principles behind NMN.
