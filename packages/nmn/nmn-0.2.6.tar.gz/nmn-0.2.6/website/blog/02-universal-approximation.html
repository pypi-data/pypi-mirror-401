                        Imagine you have a magic box that can draw any picture you want. You just need to tell it 
                        "draw a cat" or "draw a house" and it will draw it perfectly!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The Universal Approximation Theorem says our <span class="yat-symbol">ⵟ</span>-product networks 
                        are like that magic box — they can <strong>learn to do anything</strong> (well, any continuous function) 
                        if we give them enough "drawing tools" (neurons).

                    <p>
                        Even though we removed the activation functions (like ReLU), we didn't lose any power!

                <p>
                    When we removed activation functions, critics asked: <em>"Can you still learn complex functions?"</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Traditional neural networks rely on activation functions (ReLU, sigmoid) to create non-linearity. 
                    Without them, a network would just be a series of linear transformations — which can only learn linear functions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This theorem proves that the <span class="yat-symbol">ⵟ</span>-product's <strong>inherent geometric non-linearity</strong> 
                    is sufficient. We don't need separate activation functions because the <span class="yat-symbol">ⵟ</span>-product 
                    itself is non-linear.

                        Consider the <span class="yat-symbol">ⵟ</span>-product with bias: 
                        $g(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{w}, b) = \frac{(\mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{x} + b)^2}{\|\mathbf{w} - \mathbf{x}\|^2 + \varepsilon}$

                    <p>
                        By differentiating twice with respect to $b$:
                        $$\partial_b^2 g(\mathbf{x}; \mathbf{w}, b) = \frac{2}{\|\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{w}\|^2 + \varepsilon}$$

                        The IMQ kernel has a <strong>strictly positive Fourier transform</strong> (related to the modified Bessel function $K_0$). 
                        This is a key property for density results.

                        If a measure $\mu$ is orthogonal to all IMQ translates (i.e., $\int k(\mathbf{x}, \mathbf{w}) d\mu(\mathbf{x}) = 0$ 
                        for all $\mathbf{w}$), then by the positivity of the Fourier transform, $\mu$ must be the zero measure.

                    <strong>Step 4: Density via Hahn-Banach/Riesz Duality</strong>
                    <p>
                        By the Hahn-Banach theorem and Riesz representation theorem, if the span of $\{g(\cdot; \mathbf{w}, b)\}$ 
                        is not dense, there exists a non-zero continuous linear functional that vanishes on the span. 
                        This functional corresponds to a measure, which by Step 3 must be zero — a contradiction.

                        and span the entire function space through differentiation. This is why we use 
                        $(\mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{x} + b)^2$ rather than just $(\mathbf{w}^\top\mathbf{x})^2$.

                            NMNs are as expressive as ReLU/Sigmoid networks. Single hidden layer is sufficient in theory

                <p>
                    This is the <strong>fundamental existence theorem</strong> for NMNs. It answers the question: 
                    "Can we really learn complex functions without activation functions?"
                </p>
                <p>
                    The answer is a resounding <strong>yes</strong>. The <span class="yat-symbol">ⵟ</span>-product's 
                    geometric structure provides sufficient non-linearity to approximate any continuous function.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This theorem bridges the gap between <em>theoretical possibility</em> and <em>practical feasibility</em>, 
                    showing that activation-free networks are not just a curiosity — they're a viable alternative 
                    with the same expressive power.

                <h4>📜 Historical Context</h4>
                <p>
                    Universal approximation theorems date back to the 1980s, with seminal work by Cybenko (1989) and 
                    Hornik et al. (1989) showing that single-hidden-layer networks with sigmoidal activations are universal approximators.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our theorem extends this tradition, showing that <em>geometric non-linearity</em> (via the <span class="yat-symbol">ⵟ</span>-product) 
                    can replace <em>functional non-linearity</em> (via activations) without losing approximation power.
