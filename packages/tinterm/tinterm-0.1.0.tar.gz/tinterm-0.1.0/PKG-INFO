              not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
              and conversions to other media types.
        
              "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
              Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
              copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally

           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only

              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

# TinTerm

A lightweight Python library for styling terminal output with colors and text modifiers.

## Why Another Terminal Color Library?

TinTerm takes a different approach to terminal styling with three key design principles:

1. **Strict separation of style and text:** Style information is kept separate from your text content, making it easy to work with the plain text while keeping styles consistent.

2. **Lazy rendering:** Styled objects don't generate ANSI codes until you explicitly render them, giving you full control over when and where colors are applied.

3. **Zero-configuration color control:** Toggle colors on/off globally with a single call. Perfect for logging to files, CI environments, or respecting `NO_COLOR` conventions.

## Getting Started For Regular Users
Install TinTerm using pip:

```bash
pip install tinterm
```

**Note:** On Windows, the `colorama` package is automatically installed as a dependency to enable ANSI color support.

## Getting Started For Developers
If you want to build and install TinTerm from source:

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone git@github.com:TobiasHafner/tinterm.git
cd tinterm
```

### 2. Create a virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

### 3. Activate the virtual environment

**Linux / macOS**
```bash
source .venv/bin/activate
```

**Windows**
In cmd:
```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

In powershell:
```powershell
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

### 4. Install in development mode
```bash
pip install -e .
```

This installs the package in "editable" mode, so changes to the source code are immediately reflected without reinstalling.

### 5. Install development dependencies
```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### 6. Build the package
```bash
python -m build
```

This creates distribution files in the `dist/` directory:
- `tinterm-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl` (wheel format)
- `tinterm-x.x.x.tar.gz` (source distribution)

### 7. Install from the built package
```bash
pip install dist/tinterm-x.x.x-py3-none-any.whl
```

### 8. Run the Demo
To verify the installation and to see TinTerm's features in action, you can run the included demo application:

```bash
# From the repository root directory
python demo/demo.py
```

The demo displays:
- All 16 foreground colors (standard and bright variants)
- All background colors with contrasting text
- All 7 text modifiers (bold, dim, italic, underline, blink, reverse, strikethrough)
- Practical examples like error/success/warning messages
- Creative combinations like rainbow text

## Basic Concepts
Understanding these core concepts will help you use TinTerm effectively.

### Colors
TinTerm supports two types of colors: **foreground** (text color) and **background** (background color). Colors are defined using the `Color` enum and can be applied to text through the style dictionary.
TinTerm provides 16 colors total: 8 standard colors and 8 bright variants.

**Standard Colors:**
- `Color.BLACK` - Standard black
- `Color.RED` - Standard red
- `Color.GREEN` - Standard green
- `Color.YELLOW` - Standard yellow
- `Color.BLUE` - Standard blue
- `Color.MAGENTA` - Standard magenta
- `Color.CYAN` - Standard cyan
- `Color.WHITE` - Standard white

**Bright Colors:**
- `Color.BRIGHT_BLACK` - Bright black (gray)
- `Color.BRIGHT_RED` - Bright red
- `Color.BRIGHT_GREEN` - Bright green
- `Color.BRIGHT_YELLOW` - Bright yellow
- `Color.BRIGHT_BLUE` - Bright blue
- `Color.BRIGHT_MAGENTA` - Bright magenta
- `Color.BRIGHT_CYAN` - Bright cyan
- `Color.BRIGHT_WHITE` - Bright white

### Modifiers
Modifiers change how text appears beyond just color. They can make text bold, underlined, italic, and more. Multiple modifiers can be combined on the same text.

**Available Modifiers:**

| Modifier | Effect | ANSI Code | Terminal Support |
|----------|--------|-----------|------------------|
| `Modifier.BOLD` | Bold/bright text | 1 | Universal |
| `Modifier.DIM` | Dimmed text | 2 | Most terminals |
| `Modifier.ITALIC` | Italic text | 3 | Modern terminals |
| `Modifier.UNDERLINE` | Underlined text | 4 | Universal |
| `Modifier.BLINK` | Blinking text | 5 | Limited support |
| `Modifier.REVERSE` | Inverted foreground/background | 7 | Universal |
| `Modifier.STRIKETHROUGH` | Strikethrough text | 9 | Modern terminals |

### Styles
A style is a dictionary that defines how text should appear. It uses `StyleKey` enum values as keys and specifies colors and modifiers as values. All style keys are optional. You can specify just a foreground color, just modifiers, or any combination.

**Example:**
```python
style = {
    StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.RED,           # Optional: text color
    StyleKey.BACKGROUND: Color.WHITE,         # Optional: background color
    StyleKey.MODIFIERS: [Modifier.BOLD]       # Optional: text modifiers (list)
}
```

**Important Note About Modifiers:**
Modifiers should be provided as a **list** (not a tuple):

```python
# Correct
style = {StyleKey.MODIFIERS: [Modifier.BOLD, Modifier.UNDERLINE]}

# Also works, but list is preferred
style = {StyleKey.MODIFIERS: (Modifier.BOLD, Modifier.UNDERLINE)}
```

**Reusing Styles:**
It's good practice to define styles once and reuse them throughout your application:

```python
# Define your application's style guide
STYLES = {
    'error': {
        StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.RED,
        StyleKey.MODIFIERS: [Modifier.BOLD]
    },
    'success': {
        StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.GREEN,
        StyleKey.MODIFIERS: [Modifier.BOLD]
    },
    'info': {
        StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.BLUE
    },
    'warning': {
        StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.YELLOW
    }
}

# Use them consistently
error_msg = StyledString("Error occurred", style=STYLES['error'])
success_msg = StyledString("Task completed", style=STYLES['success'])
```

### Styled Strings
A `StyledString` is the fundamental building block of TinTerm. It's a string with associated styling information.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Stores text and style separately**: The text is stored in the `text` attribute, and styling in the `style` dictionary
- **Lightweight**: Uses `__slots__` for memory efficiency
- **String representation**: The `__str__()` method returns only the plain text without styling
- **Immutable styling**: Once created, the style doesn't change (but you can create new styled strings)
- **Composable**: Can be concatenated with other styled strings or plain strings/objects

**Creating Styled Strings:**
```python
# With style
my_style = {
    StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.RED,
    StyleKey.MODIFIERS: [Modifier.BOLD]
}
styled = StyledString("Hello", style=my_style)

# Without style (plain text)
plain = StyledString("Hello", style={})
# or simply
plain = StyledString("Hello")
```

**Accessing Properties:**
```python
s = StyledString("hello", style={StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.BLUE})

# Access the plain text
s.text          # "hello"
str(s)          # "hello" (same as s.text)

# Access the style dictionary
s.style         # {StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.BLUE}

# Get length
len(s)          # 5 (length of the text)
```

**Concatenation:**
When you concatenate `StyledString` objects, you create a `StyledText` object:

```python
red = StyledString("Red", style={StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.RED})
blue = StyledString("Blue", style={StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.BLUE})

# All of these create StyledText objects
combined1 = red + blue              # Two StyledStrings
combined2 = red + " "               # StyledString + plain string
combined3 = "Prefix: " + red        # Plain string + StyledString
```

**Notes:**
- The `StyledString` class doesn't provide string manipulation methods like `upper()`, `lower()`, `split()`, etc. You need to manipulate the text yourself and create new `StyledString` objects if needed
- Converting to string with `str()` returns only the plain text without any styling or ANSI codes
- Empty strings can have styles: `StyledString("", style={StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.RED})`

### Styled Text
A `StyledText` object represents multiple parts concatenated together, where each part can have its own independent styling. Each part is stored internally as a `StyledString`.

**Creating Styled Texts:**
You don't typically create `StyledText` objects directly using the constructor. They're automatically created when you concatenate `StyledString` objects or mix styled strings with plain strings/objects:

```python
part1 = StyledString("Error", style={StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.RED})
part2 = StyledString(": ", style={})
part3 = StyledString("Connection failed", style={StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.YELLOW})

# This automatically creates a StyledText with three parts
message = part1 + part2 + part3

# Mixing with plain strings also works
mixed = part1 + " " + part2  # The " " becomes a StyledString internally
```

**How StyledText._from_parts() Works:**
The `_from_parts()` static method intelligently handles different input types:
- `StyledText` objects are flattened (their parts are extracted and added individually)
- `StyledString` objects are added directly
- Other objects are converted to strings and wrapped in a `StyledString` with no styling

```python
# These all work
text1 = StyledString("Hello") + StyledString("World")
text2 = StyledString("Hello") + " World"  # String becomes StyledString
text3 = StyledString("Count: ") + 42       # Number becomes StyledString("42")
```

**Structure:**
A `StyledText` maintains a list of `StyledString` parts accessible via the `parts` property:

```python
# Accessing parts
for part in message.parts:
    print(f"Text: {part.text}, Style: {part.style}")
```

**Operations:**
`StyledText` supports several operations:

```python
text = red_string + " " + blue_string + " " + green_string

# Concatenation (returns new StyledText)
more_text = text + StyledString(" More", style={StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.YELLOW})
more_text = text + " More"  # Also works

# Length (total length of all parts)
len(text)

# Iteration over parts
for part in text:
    print(render(part))

# String representation (plain text only, no styling)
str(text)  # Concatenated plain text from all parts
```

**Why StyledText Matters:**
`StyledText` allows you to build complex, multi-colored output while keeping each part's styling independent:

```python
# Build a colorful log message
timestamp = StyledString("[2024-01-12 10:30:15]", style={
    StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.BRIGHT_BLACK
})

level = StyledString(" ERROR ", style={
    StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.WHITE,
    StyleKey.BACKGROUND: Color.RED,
    StyleKey.MODIFIERS: [Modifier.BOLD]
})

message = StyledString(" Database connection failed", style={
    StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.RED
})

log_line = timestamp + level + message
print(render(log_line))
```

### The Render Function

The `render()` function converts your styled objects (`StyledString` or `StyledText`) into a string with ANSI escape codes that can be printed to the terminal.

**Usage:**
```python
from tinterm.render import render

styled = StyledString("Hello", style={StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.RED})
output = render(styled)
print(output)  # Prints "Hello" in red
```

**How It Works:**
The render function processes styled objects using a stack-based approach:
- For `StyledText` objects, it processes each part individually
- For `StyledString` objects, it extracts color and modifier information from the style dictionary and generates appropriate ANSI codes
- ANSI codes are wrapped around the text: `\033[<codes>m<text>\033[0m`

**Color Control:**
You can globally enable or disable color rendering:

```python
from tinterm.render import enable_colors, disable_colors

# Disable colors (returns plain text without ANSI codes)
disable_colors()
print(render(styled))  # Prints plain "Hello" without colors

# Re-enable colors
enable_colors()
print(render(styled))  # Prints "Hello" in red again
```

When colors are disabled, `render()` returns only the plain text content, which is useful for:
- Logging to files
- Running in environments without ANSI support
- Testing
- Piping output to other programs

**Performance:**
Rendering is lightweight, but if you're rendering the same styled text repeatedly in a loop, consider rendering once and reusing the result:

```python
# Less efficient
for i in range(1000):
    print(render(styled_text))

# More efficient
rendered = render(styled_text)
for i in range(1000):
    print(rendered)
```

## Complete Example

Here's a complete example showing how to use TinTerm:

```python
from tinterm.styled import StyledString, StyledText
from tinterm.attributes import Color, Modifier, StyleKey
from tinterm.render import render

# Define some styles
error_style = {
    StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.RED,
    StyleKey.MODIFIERS: [Modifier.BOLD]
}

success_style = {
    StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.GREEN,
    StyleKey.MODIFIERS: [Modifier.BOLD]
}

info_style = {
    StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.CYAN
}

# Create styled strings
header = StyledString("=== System Status ===", style={
    StyleKey.FOREGROUND: Color.BRIGHT_WHITE,
    StyleKey.MODIFIERS: [Modifier.BOLD, Modifier.UNDERLINE]
})

error_msg = StyledString("ERROR: ", style=error_style) + "Database connection failed"
success_msg = StyledString("SUCCESS: ", style=success_style) + "Server started on port 8080"
info_msg = StyledString("INFO: ", style=info_style) + "Loading configuration..."

# Render and print
print(render(header))
print(render(error_msg))
print(render(success_msg))
print(render(info_msg))
```
