    Validate the compatibility of a batch of circuits for Fire Opal.

    Parameters
    ----------
    circuits : list[str]
        A list of quantum circuits in the form of QASM strings. You can use Qiskit to
        generate these strings.
    credentials : Credentials
        The credentials for running circuits on an IBM backend.
        Use the `make_credentials_for_ibm_cloud` function from the `credentials` module
        to generate properly formatted credentials.
    backend_name : str
        The backend device name that will be used to run circuits after validation.

    Returns
    -------
    dict
        The output of the validate workflow.
