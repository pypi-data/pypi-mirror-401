    Solve a QAOA problem.

    Parameters
    ----------
    problem : Expr or nx.Graph
        The QAOA problem definition, represented as either an
        `nx.Graph` or `sympy.Expr`.
    credentials : Credentials
        The credentials for running circuits on an IBM backend.
        Use the `make_credentials_for_ibm_cloud` function from the `credentials` module
        to generate properly formatted credentials.
    problem_type : str, optional
        The class of QAOA problem to solve. Required for graph problem definitions,
        which currently only includes support for "maxcut".
    backend_name : str, optional
        The backend device that should be used to run circuits. Defaults to None.
    run_options : RunOptions or None, optional
        Additional options for circuit execution. See the `run_options` module
        for classes to store run options for your desired provider.
        Defaults to None.

    Returns
    -------
    FireOpalJob
        A job object containing results and warnings from the execution. The
        results have the following keys:

        ``solution_bitstring (str)``
            The solution bitstring with the best cost found, across all iterations.
        ``solution_bitstring_cost (float)``
            The cost of the solution bitstring.
        ``final_bitstring_distribution (dict[str, int])``
            The bitstring counts dictionary associated with the minimum cost
            across all iterations.
        ``iteration_count (int)``
            The total number of QAOA iterations performed by the optimizer.
        ``variables_to_bitstring_index_map (dict[str, int])``
            The mapping from the variables to the equivalent bit in the bitstring.
        ``best_parameters (list[float])``
            The optimized beta and gamma parameters across all iterations.
        ``warnings (list[str])``
            The warnings produced while compiling or running QAOA.
