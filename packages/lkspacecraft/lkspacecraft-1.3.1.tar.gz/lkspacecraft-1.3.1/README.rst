lkspacecraft
============

.. <!-- intro content start -->

This package provides a way to access the orbital parameters for the
Kepler and TESS spacecrafts. This will enable you to access

1. Spacecraft position at any given time with respect to the solar
   system barycenter, the earth, or the moon
2. Spacecraft velocity at any given time with respect to the solar
   system barycenter, the earth, or the moon
3. The baycentric time correction for any target RA/Dec at any time
4. The velocity aberration for any target RA/Dec at any time

Requirements
------------

This package relies heavily on
`spiceypy <https://github.com/AndrewAnnex/SpiceyPy>`__ which wraps
`SPICE <https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/naif/toolkit.html>`__. It also relies
on `astropy <https://www.astropy.org/>`__.

Installation
------------

You can install this package with ``pip`` using

.. code-block:: console

   pip install lkspacecraft --upgrade

You can also install this package by cloning the repo and then
installing via poetry

.. code-block:: console

   git clone https://github.com/lightkurve/lkspacecraft.git
   cd lkspacecraft
   pip install --upgrade poetry
   poetry install .


This package will download and store SPICE kernels into a directory in your home area when you use any of the objects. This is approximately 1Gb of data at time of writing. This means that if you install this package in multiple environments, the SPICE kernels will not be redownloaded and will be shared between multiple installs. 

To uninstall this package from your machine entirely you should clear the cache of SPICE kernel files using 

.. code-block:: python

   from astropy.utils.data import clear_download_cache
   clear_download_cache(pkgname='lkspacecraft')

or by deleting the `.lkspacecraft/cache/` directory in your home area. You can then uninstall with pip, or if you cloned the repository you can delete the directory.

This package now installs with a lightweight set of truncated kernels which can be used to test the functionality, but cover a very limited time range and set of bodies. These files are available in `src/data/kernels/testkernels`. 

Usage
-----

``lkspacecraft`` provides ``Spacecraft`` object which will enable you to
access the orbital parameters of either the Kepler or TESS spacecraft.
``lkspacecraft`` will obtain the relevant SPICE kernels to calculate the
spacecraft position and velocity. To get the orbital elements you will
need to pick a time that is within the relevant window of those SPICE
kernels (i.e. when the mission was operational).

You can find the start and end times of the kernels using the following

.. code-block:: python

   from lkspacecraft import KeplerSpacecraft

   ks = KeplerSpacecraft()
   ks.start_time, ks.end_time

All times in ``lkspacecraft`` use ``astropy.time.Time`` objects. Using the
``get_spacecraft_position`` or ``get_spacecraft_velocity`` functions
will provide you with the position or velocity in cartesian coordinates,
for example

.. code-block:: python

   from lkspacecraft import KeplerSpacecraft
   from astropy.time import Time

   ks = KeplerSpacecraft()
   t = Time("2009-04-06 06:22:56.000025")
   ks.get_spacecraft_velocity(t)

will result in

::

   array([[  6.94188023, -26.24714425, -11.16828662]])

This will give the velocity with respect to the solar system barycenter
by default, but you can specify the earth or moon using

.. code-block:: python

   from lkspacecraft import KeplerSpacecraft
   from astropy.time import Time

   ks = KeplerSpacecraft()
   t = Time("2009-04-06 06:22:56.000025")
   ks.get_spacecraft_velocity(time=t, observer="earth")

You are able to calculate the light arrival time of observations of a
source at a given RA/Dec using ``lkspacecraft``\ ’s
``get_barycentric_time_correction`` function. This will give you the
time delay in seconds from spacecraft time to time at the barycenter.

.. code-block:: python

   from lkspacecraft import KeplerSpacecraft
   from astropy.time import Time

   ks = KeplerSpacecraft()
   t = Time("2009-04-06 06:22:56.000025")
   ks.get_barycentric_time_correction(time=t, ra=290.666, dec=44.5)

Finally you can calculate velocity aberration using

.. code-block:: python

   from lkspacecraft import KeplerSpacecraft
   from astropy.time import Time

   ks = KeplerSpacecraft()
   t = Time("2009-04-06 06:22:56.000025")
   ks.get_velocity_aberrated_positions(time=t, ra=290.666, dec=44.5)

Units
~~~~~

In ``lkspacecraft``, just as in ``SPICE``, units are ``km`` and ``s``, unless
otherwise specified.

Kernels
-------

``lkspacecraft`` will obtain the SPICE kernels for Kepler and TESS for you
store them. Kernels can be found here:

The generic kernels can be obtained from NAIF generic kernels:
https://naif.jpl.nasa.gov/pub/naif/generic_kernels/
The Kepler kernels can be obtained from MAST:
https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/kepler/spice/ 
The K2 kernels can be obtained from MAST: 
https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/k2/spice/ The
TESS kernels can be obtained from MAST:
https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/engineering/
https://archive.stsci.edu/missions/tess/models/

When you first initialize an `lkspacecraft.Spacecraft` object in Python all the kernels will be downloaded for you, and ``lkspacecraft`` will check if there are new kernels available. This will take approximately 5 minutes if you have no kernels, depending on your internet connection. Once this has been done, the kernels will be cached. If there are new TESS kernels available `lkspacecraft` will retrieve them for you and update the cache. 

The total file volume for the kernels is ~1GB. These cached files are stored using `astropy`'s cache. If you want to clear the cache you can do either of the following;

.. code-block:: python

   from lkspacecraft.utils import clear_download_cache
   clear_download_cache()
   
.. code-block:: python

   from astropy.utils.data import clear_download_cache
   clear_download_cache(pkgname='lkspacecraft')

Because the kernels need to be checked, every time you initialize a ``Spacecraft``, like below, object there will be a slight delay, and ``lkspacecraft`` will connect to the internet to check for new kernels. 

.. code-block:: python

   ks = KeplerSpacecraft()

Testing ``lkspacecraft``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to run tests for ``lkspacecraft`` or run tests of your own package where ``lkspacecraft`` is a dependency, you will not want to download the kernels as this will slow down your continuous integration. ``lkspacecraft`` has a "test mode" which will use small, truncated SPICE kernels that are valid for specific dates:

- For Kepler, the test kernels cover approximately one day around July 25th 2010
- For TESS, the test kernels cover Sector 4 (10/18/18 - 11/15/18) 

When you load ``lkspacecraft`` test mode will always be turned off. You can enable or disable test mode using

.. code-block:: python

   import lkspacecraft
   lkspacecraft.enable_test_mode()
   lkspacecraft.disable_test_mode()

If you are designing continuous integration and have lkspacecraft as a dependency, make sure to include "lkspacecraft.enable_test_mode()" before the test function. 

Note that using test mode is less accurate, because the truncated files are small and interpolated. This should test functionality, but be careful when using test mode to test accuracy.

Extending ``lkspacecraft``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you wanted to extend ``lkspacecraft`` to include more spacecraft you would
need to include more kernels in the kernel directory and ensure they are
added to the meta kernel. You can then create a new class in the
``spacecraft.py`` module with the correct NAIF code.

Caveats
-------

Velocity Aberration vs. Differential Velocity Aberration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package will provide you **velocity aberration**. However, each of
these spacecrafts repoint during observations to account for the bulk
offset of velocity aberration. If you are interested in where stars will
fall on pixels, you should consider calculating the **differential
velocity aberration**.

Spacecraft Time
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This package assumes you will provide time as the time **at the
spacecraft**. For SPOC products, this is the time in the ``'TIME'``
column of any fits file, with the time corrections from ``TIME_CORR``
subtracted. i.e.

.. code-block:: python

       t = np.asarray(hdulist[1].data['TIME'], dtype=float)
       tcorr = np.asarray(hdulist[1].data['TIMECORR'], dtype=float)
       # Spacecraft time:
       t -= tcorr

If you are trying to accurately calculate time corrections, it is
important you use the spacecraft time in all functions.

The easiest way to install ``lkspacecraft`` and all of its dependencies is to use the ``pip`` command,
which is a standard part of all Python distributions. (upon release)

To install ``lkspacecraft``, run the following command in a terminal window:

.. code-block:: console

  $ python -m pip install lkspacecraft --upgrade

The ``--upgrade`` flag is optional, but recommended if you already
have ``lkspacecraft`` installed and want to upgrade to the latest version.

You can use `lkspacecraft` to access position and velocity information of Kepler and TESS using input times

.. code-block:: python

  from lkspacecraft import KeplerSpacecraft
  ks = KeplerSpacecraft()
  t = Time("2009-04-06 06:22:56.000025")
  ks.get_velocity_aberrated_positions(time=t, ra=290.666, dec=44.5)
