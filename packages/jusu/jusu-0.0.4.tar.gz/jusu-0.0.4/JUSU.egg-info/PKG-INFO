JUSU
====

JUSU is a lightweight, beginner-friendly Python framework developed and maintained by **Francis Jusu**. It is designed to make building styled and accessible websites or small web apps fast and enjoyable through a concise, readable API for HTML and CSS generation.

About this project

JUSU (by **Francis Jusu**) enables developers to author complex, component-driven web pages entirely in Python. It excels at creating well-structured static and dynamic pages with programmatic control over HTML, CSS, and optional FastAPI-based backend features. Key strengths include: clear, beginner-friendly APIs, a compact StyleSheet system, and seamless bundling/export utilities that produce ready-to-serve artifacts.

What it's good at

- Building component-based HTML/CSS driven sites quickly using pure Python
- Producing reusable bundle artifacts (HTML + CSS, optional ZIP) for deployment
- Integrating lightweight backend behavior with FastAPI (auth, sessions, middleware)
- Providing privacy-focused helpers and well-tested utilities that reduce developer friction

When to extend

For large-scale, heavy-traffic applications you may want to pair JUSU with specialized tooling (ESBuild/Vite for large JS apps, production-grade reverse proxies, and database migration strategies) — JUSU provides a clean foundation and integration points to make that straightforward.

**Highlights & Capabilities**

- **Beginner-focused, readable API** for composing HTML elements and nesting content without verbose templates.
- **Minimal dependencies & pragmatic defaults**, making it ideal for quick prototypes as well as lightweight production sites.
- **Optional FastAPI integration** (auth helpers, session middleware, and convenient dependencies) for building small web backends.
- **Bundling & CLI tools** to export standalone HTML/CSS bundles and optional ZIP artifacts for simple deployments.
- **Firebase helpers & storage utilities** for secure server-side integrations when needed.
- **Privacy-first and well-tested** — includes middleware and utilities for safe defaults and good test coverage.

Quick usage:

Quick usage:

```python
from JUSU import Div, H1, P, Button, Img

page = Div(
	H1("Welcome to JUSU"),
	P("A tiny HTML builder."),
	Button("Click me", onclick="alert('Hello')", cls="btn"),
	Img(src="https://via.placeholder.com/150", alt="demo"),
	cls="container"
)
page.render_to_file("jusu_demo.html")
```

Run tests:

```bash
python -m pytest
```

Install:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

**Course:** A beginner-friendly course (text + interactive notebooks) is available in the `course/` directory — authored by **Francis Jusu**.


## Bundling & CLI

- `Tag.bundle(...)` / `Tag.bundle_export(...)` — produce an HTML file and CSS file (and optionally a ZIP archive) for a component.
- `jusu bundle` (CLI) — bundle a component by import path (see `docs/bundling.md`).

FastAPI example

A minimal FastAPI example is available at `examples/fastapi_app.py`. Install the optional web extras and run:

```bash
pip install -e .[web]
uvicorn examples.fastapi_app:app.app --reload
```

Auth & DB example

A small auth example backed by `sqlmodel` is available at `examples/auth_db_app.py`. Install the extras and run:

```bash
pip install -e .[web,auth,db]
python examples/auth_db_app.py
```

Password hashing

By default JUSU prefers `passlib[bcrypt]` for password hashing when available; the library falls back to a legacy SHA256+salt method only when `passlib` is not installed. Install the `auth` extras to get `passlib`:

```bash
pip install -e .[auth]
```

Alembic init & revision helpers

You can bootstrap an Alembic environment with the CLI:

```bash
jusu migrate --init
```

Create a new revision (autogenerate when possible):

```bash
jusu migrate --create -m "add users"
```

Firebase support

JUSU includes an optional admin SDK wrapper at `JUSU/firebase.py` for server-side Firebase usage (ID token verification and Firestore client). Security notes:

- **Do not** commit service account JSON to source control. Use `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` or other secure methods to provide credentials.
- Use the Admin SDK only on trusted servers; never embed admin credentials into public code or client apps.

Install the optional extras and see `tests/test_firebase.py` for a mocked example:

```bash
pip install -e .[firebase]
```

## Privacy-first: do not store users' product data 🔒

JUSU encourages a privacy-first default: avoid storing users' product or purchase data on the server. Recommended patterns:

- **Direct client uploads using presigned URLs:** the server issues short-lived presigned upload credentials and does not persist the uploaded content; see `JUSU.storage.generate_s3_presigned_post`.
- **Redirect to a provider or third-party uploader:** send the user to a trusted upload widget or flow so their data never touches your servers.
- **Client-side storage/export:** provide a download/export option so users keep their own copies locally.

Use `StripProductDataMiddleware` (in `JUSU.privacy`) to automatically strip or block product fields from incoming JSON payloads. Default behavior is to *strip* product fields and add response header `X-Product-Data-Removed: 1`.

If you must retain a reference to an uploaded object, store only non-sensitive metadata (provider, object key, URL, timestamp) and never store raw product content or PII unless you have explicit, documented consent.

NPM assets

A minimal npm package `jusu-assets` is available in this repository (under `package_assets/`) containing optional CSS and tiny JS helpers. See `docs/npm.md` for instructions on running a local dry-run and publishing to npm.

Publish to TestPyPI (recommended first):

1. Create an account on https://test.pypi.org/ and generate an API token.
2. Set the API token as environment variables, for example (Powershell):

```powershell
$Env:TWINE_USERNAME = "__token__"
$Env:TWINE_PASSWORD = "pypi-AgENdGVzdC..."
```

3. Build and upload to TestPyPI:

```powershell
python -m build -o dist
python -m twine check dist/*
python -m twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*
```

Publish to PyPI (after verifying TestPyPI):

```powershell
python -m twine upload dist/*
```

If you prefer to specify the username and token directly instead of environment variables, pass `--username` and `--password` to `twine upload`, but environment variables are more secure.
