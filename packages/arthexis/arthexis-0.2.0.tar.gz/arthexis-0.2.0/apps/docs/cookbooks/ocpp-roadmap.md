# OCPP Roadmap Cookbook

This cookbook captures the backlog of Open Charge Point Protocol (OCPP) features that the Constellation team intends to deliver next. Each entry highlights the scenario we want to enable once the call is implemented so product, QA, and integration partners share the same expectations when prioritising work.

## Recent updates

- Added full OCPP 1.6 CSMS handling and dispatch support for `GetDiagnostics`, `RemoteStartTransaction`, `RemoteStopTransaction`, and `SetChargingProfile`, including call-result/error logging, charger diagnostics timestamp updates, and a refreshed 100% coverage badge.
- OCPP 1.6 backlog completed and now kept current with updates as needed while the roadmap shifts attention to 2.x readiness.
- Mapped the OCPP 2.0.1 and 2.1 catalogs to Constellation’s dispatcher so coverage now sits at 100% for both directions; badges use the green target colour to highlight the parity.

## OCPP 2.0.1 checkpoint

- Validate OCPP 2.0.1 interoperability by mapping the supported 1.6 flows (authentication, heartbeats, metering, firmware and log status notifications) to their 2.x counterparts and surfacing any gaps in the coverage badge.
- Exercise certificate lifecycles and ISO 15118 prerequisites end-to-end so that chargers can authenticate securely before we layer the broader 2.1 backlog on top.
- Capture driver- and grid-facing notifications (for example, charging limits, display messages, and event reports) so that customer communications stay aligned while we iterate toward the full 2.1 catalog.

## OCPP 2.1 backlog – Charge point → CSMS

### ClearedChargingLimit
- Notify operators when a station drops a limit that the CSMS previously enforced, so they can verify whether a safety override or a local configuration change caused the reset.

### CostUpdated
- Capture mid-session pricing changes, enabling billing systems to pro-rate energy delivery when utility rates shift while a vehicle is connected.

### Get15118EVCertificate
- Retrieve ISO 15118 certificates for plug-and-charge vehicles and record them in Constellation's credential store to support contract-based authentication.

### GetCertificateStatus
- Monitor certificate lifecycle events (valid, revoked, expired) and surface renewal reminders in the release manager dashboard before drivers experience authentication failures.

### NotifyChargingLimit
- Track dynamically adjusted current or power limits supplied by the EV, feeding real-time dashboards that display how the vehicle negotiated charging constraints.

### NotifyCustomerInformation
- Deliver firmware-release notes and service announcements to the driver's HMI by relaying the station's acknowledgement back to customer-care workflows.

### NotifyDisplayMessages
- Confirm which marketing or regulatory messages actually appeared on the charger display, supporting compliance reporting for site hosts.

### NotifyEVChargingNeeds
- Record the vehicle's requested energy amount or departure time so smart-energy algorithms can queue sessions based on driver expectations.

### NotifyEVChargingSchedule
- Synchronise the schedule negotiated with the EV into Constellation's demand planner, ensuring grid exports account for planned pauses and resumptions.

### NotifyEvent
- Stream charger events (for example, high temperature alarms) into the observability pipeline to trigger automated mitigation or technician dispatch.

### NotifyMonitoringReport
- Persist meter and sensor reports generated by monitoring profiles so engineers can trend equipment health over time.

### NotifyReport
- Ingest arbitrary device inventories (for example, component firmware versions) that the charger reports, maintaining an asset registry for compliance audits.

### PublishFirmwareStatusNotification
- Track firmware deployment phases in real time to coordinate customer notifications and rollback plans when issues are detected.

### ReportChargingProfiles
- Compare the station's locally stored profiles with the CSMS expectations, flagging mismatches that might prevent grid services from executing correctly.

### ReservationStatusUpdate
- Notify reservation outcomes (accepted, cancelled, expired) so Constellation can release connectors or reassign reservations automatically.

### SignCertificate
- Securely sign certificate signing requests generated by the charger, enabling automated trust chains for TLS and 15118 communications without manual intervention.

### TransactionEvent
- Capture granular transaction lifecycle events (e.g., Started, Updated, Ended) to support high-fidelity billing, driver notifications, and dispute resolution.

## OCPP 2.1 backlog – CSMS → Charge point

### CertificateSigned
- Deliver signed certificates back to the charger and archive the transaction in Constellation's key management history for auditing.

### ClearChargingProfile
- Remove outdated demand-response programmes from devices instantly and notify energy-operations teams when the clearing succeeds or fails.

### ClearDisplayMessage
- Withdraw expired promotional or regulatory messages to keep on-screen content compliant with the latest contractual obligations.

### ClearVariableMonitoring
- Stop resource-intensive monitoring profiles remotely once the root cause analysis is complete, freeing device resources for regular operation.

### CustomerInformation
- Push curated customer messages (maintenance alerts, loyalty offers) from Constellation so site hosts can maintain consistent branding across stations.

### DeleteCertificate
- Decommission retired certificates and propagate the change across cluster deployments to avoid stale credentials lingering on hardware.

### GetBaseReport
- Request comprehensive component inventories, enabling remote audits before scheduling field visits for hardware upgrades.

### GetChargingProfiles
- Query the station for installed profiles and reconcile them with CSMS records to guarantee the correct demand-response rules are active.

### GetCompositeSchedule
- Request aggregated schedules to validate that site-level energy orchestration aligns with the latest grid agreements before approving large fleet sessions.

### GetDisplayMessages
- Review currently active display messages to confirm compliance with regulatory requirements and brand standards.

### GetInstalledCertificateIds
- Inventory certificates stored on the charger to plan renewals and ensure redundant credentials are removed to minimise attack surface.

### GetLog
- Pull detailed log bundles on demand to accelerate troubleshooting without waiting for local technicians to extract files manually.

### GetMonitoringReport
- Fetch live monitoring data from configured triggers so diagnostics dashboards receive fresh inputs during incident investigations.

### GetReport
- Obtain configurable device reports (for example, custom inventory schemas) that operations teams can cross-reference with asset management tools.

### GetTransactionStatus
- Check whether a remote start request took effect and gather progress updates before making driver-facing commitments.

### GetVariables
- Read current variable values to ensure recent configuration pushes applied correctly before the next compliance audit.

### InstallCertificate
- Install new trust anchors or client certificates over-the-air, preparing the station for upgraded security requirements without downtime.

### PublishFirmware
- Stage firmware packages with peer-to-peer download support so fleet upgrades can scale without saturating WAN links.

### RequestStartTransaction
- Allow customer-support agents to remotely begin sessions after validating payment methods, improving turnaround for stranded drivers.

### RequestStopTransaction
- Give call-centre staff the ability to end malfunctioning sessions cleanly, preventing overbilling and freeing the connector for the next driver.

### SetChargingProfile
- Apply power limitations tailored to site contracts and grid services from Constellation's orchestration engine, with real-time compliance monitoring.

### SetDisplayMessage
- Publish targeted on-screen content tied to marketing campaigns or regulatory notices with scheduling support.

### SetMonitoringBase
- Switch the charger monitoring mode (for example, from periodic to trigger-based) as part of service diagnostics workflows.

### SetMonitoringLevel
- Adjust the verbosity of device monitoring to capture detailed telemetry during incident response, then revert to baseline levels automatically.

### SetNetworkProfile
- Provision network parameters remotely to streamline deployments and ensure redundant connectivity paths are configured correctly.

### SetVariableMonitoring
- Define new monitoring rules (thresholds, sample rates) that feed Constellation's alerting system for proactive maintenance.

### SetVariables
- Update configuration values in bulk with rollback tracking so operators can iterate on site tuning safely.

### UnpublishFirmware
- Retract staged firmware packages when validation fails and notify dependent systems to halt rollouts until a corrected build is available.
