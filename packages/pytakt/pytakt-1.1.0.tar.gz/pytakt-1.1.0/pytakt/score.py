class Score(object):
    """
    This class is an abstract class for scores.
    A score is either an event list (an instance of the EventList class),
    an event stream (an instance of the EventStream class),
    or a Tracks container.
    An event list is a list of zero or more events, with an attribute
    called duration (see below) added.
    An event stream is an object that uses Python's generator mechanism
    to generate events in sequence, allowing for the representation of
    infinite-length scores.
    A Tracks container is a list of zero or more event lists or other Tracks
    containers as elements, representing a structure in which all elements
    are played concurrently.

    .. rubric:: Duration

    Scores have the concept of duration, which represents the length of
    the performance in ticks. In sequential concatenation of scores,
    the start time of the performance of a score is set to the start time
    of its previous score plus the duration of the score.
    The duration of an EventList is equal to the value of its duration
    attribute. The duration of a Tracks is the maximum duration among
    its components. The duration of an EventStream is the value attribute of
    the StopIteration exception raised when the end of the stream is reached.
    The duration is non-negative and is not necessarily equal to the maximum
    time of the events in the score; it may be greater or even less.

    .. rubric:: Arithmetic Rules

    * The '+' operator: If `s1` and `s2` are Score objects, then `s1 + s2`
      implies a sequential concatenation and returns a new score that plays
      the two scores in sequence. The result is an EventStream if `s2` is
      an EventStream, otherwise an EventList. `s1` must not be an EventStream.
      Each event in `s2` is copied and its time is shifted by the duraion
      of `s1`. The resulting score's duration is the sum of the durations
      of the two scores.
    * The '+=' operator: In `s1 += s2`, if `s1` is an EventList and `s2` is
      a score other than an EventStream, then the copied events of `s2` are
      added in-place to `s1`.
      Otherwise, it is equivalent to `s1 = s1 + s2`.
    * The '&' operator: If `s1` and `s2` are Score objects, then `s1 & s2`
      implies parallel merging and returns a new score that plays the two
      scores simultaneously. The result is an EventStream if one or both of
      `s1` and `s2` are EventStream, otherwise an EventList. No copying of
      events is performed. The duration of the resulting score will be
      either the durations of the two scores, whichever is greater.
    * The '&=' operator: In `s1 &= s2`, if `s1` is an EventList and `s2` is
      a score other than an EventStream, then the events in `s2` are added
      in-place to `s1`. Otherwise, it is equivalent to `s1 = s1 & s2`.
    * The '*' operator:
      The product of a Score object and an integer is a score that repeats
      the original score by the integer value. `s1` must not be an
      EventStream. The result will always be an EventList.

    Examples:
        ``(note(C4) + note(D4) + note(E4)).play()``

        ``(note(C4) & note(E4) & note(G4)).play()``

        ``(note(C4) * 16).play()``

        continued since the previous span.
        The EventList has an additional attribute named 'start', which

                Note that whether or not events are such additional
                references can be determined by comparing the time of the event
                and the start time of the span: an event `ev` is an
                additional reference if `ev.t < evlist.start` where

                Note-ons and note-offs within this value of time difference
                are considered to be the same time and have a single span
                boundary.
                If omitted, it is set to 50 ticks if `self` is a
                RealTimeStream; otherwise it is set to 10\\ :sup:`-6`.
            limit(ticks, optional):
                Has the same meaning as the 'limit' argument of :meth:`stream`.

        Yields:
            EventList:

        Raises:
            StopIteration: Raised when the end of the score is reached.
                The 'value' attribute of this exception object contains
                the duration of the score. It is also raised when the `limit`
                is reached, in which case the value attribute will contain
                the value of the `limit`.

        Tip:
            From the output sequence of chord_iterator(), you can get the
            score of the same performance as the original (but the duration
            may be different) by the following::

                par(EventList((ev for ev in evlist if ev.t >= evlist.start),
                              evlist.duration)
                    for evlist in score.chord_iterator())

            or ::

                par(score.chord_iterator(cont_notes=False))

        Examples:
            The program below calculates the maximum number of simultaneous
            played notes for a non-empty score s::

                max(sum(isinstance(ev, (NoteEvent, NoteOnEvent)) for ev in \
evlist)
                    for evlist in s.chord_iterator())

            The program below displays a list of sounding pitches for each
            sixteenth-note span::

                for evlist in s.chord_iterator(L16):
                    print(evlist.start,
                          [ev.n for ev in evlist if \
isinstance(ev, (NoteEvent, NoteOnEvent))])

          not including a note that has just ended at `time`. NoteEvent or
          NoteOnEvent events for notes that start sounding at `time` are
          included, unless they have zero duration (NoteEvent with the L
          attribute of 0, or NoteOnEvent with a note-off at the same time).
        * KeySignatureEvent representing the key at `time`, including those
          present at exactly `time`.

        The active events are computed based on notated time (i.e., without
        regard to the dt and du attributes).

                argument, NoteEvent, NoteOnEvent, and NoteOffEvent all have
                the same meaning as NoteEventClass).
                If an integer is specified, events are limited to CtrlEvent's

                In the case of a tuple of classes and/or integers, events
                corresponding to any of them are targetted.
                Note that when specifying RPC-related controller numbers

        Returns:
            list of Event: List of active events, which are references to
            events in the score.
            The events are ordered by time. For events present at the same
            time, they are ordered by their appearance in the socre.

        Notes:
            Without caching, the computational complexity of M queries for

        Converts a Pytakt Score object to a music21 Score object.
        In the conversion, each track in Pytakt, except track 0, is assigned
        a music21 part (one stave).

        The following information that the Pytakt score has is not output
        to the music21 score.

        * Played time information (dt and du attributes)
        * MIDI channel information (ch attribute)
        * Note-off velocity (nv attribute)
        * Information contained in CtrlEvent (and its subclasses)

          tempo events, copyright information events, track name events,
          instrument name events, and marker events (The generic
          text event (mtype=1) is output as a song title if it exists
          on track 0.)

        In the conversion, if NoteEvent has the following attributes,
        it has the meaning written below.

        * **voice** (int): Specifies a voice number, an integer greater
          than or equal to 1, indicating how the music21 Voice streams
          will be constructed if multiple voices are present.
          If this attribute is not specified, the voice number is
          automatically selected from the voice numbers that are not used
          at the same time.
        * **mark** (str or tuple of str): Specifies a string of symbols
          (staccato, accents, finger numbers, trills, etc.) to be added
          to each note.
          Multiple markers can be specified by tuples. A list of available
          strings can be found at the beginning of the pytakt.m21conv source

            min_note(ticks, optional): The duration (note value) of the
                shortest possible note to be used in the converted score.
                The smaller this value, the more accurately the Pytakt score
                is represented, but it may result in a score that is difficult
                to read when converted to staff notation.
            bar0len(ticks, optional): specifies the length of the bar
                with bar number 0.
            allow_tuplet(bool, optional): By default, up to tredecuplets
                (13-tuplets) are automatically recognized, but setting this
                argument to False disables the use of tuplets altogether.

class EventList(Score, list):
    """
    EventList is a class for event lists and inherits from both the Score
    and 'list' classes.
    An event list is a list of zero or more events, with an attribute
    called duration added, which represents the length of the performance.
    The events in the list are not necessarily ordered by time.

    Attributes:
        duration (ticks): Duration in ticks. Must not be a negative value.

    .. rubric:: Arithmetic Rules

    * The bool value is False if the number of elements is 0, as in the normal
      list. Note that an empty event list with a non-zero duration will
      also be false.
    * The equivalence comparison ('==') between event lists results in True
      if and only if the classes match, the list lengths match, all list
      elements are equivalent, and all attribute values of the event list
      are equivalent.
    * If the '|' operator is used with the left operand being a string and
      the right operand being an event list, the left operand is ignored and
      the result is the value of the event list itself. This is used
      in showtext() to ignore measure numbers, etc. to the left of the '|'.

    Args:
        events (Score or iterable of Event):
            * If it is a Score (including the case of an EventList),
              the score is converted (or 'flattened') to an event list where
              the events therein are sorted by time. Each event is not copied.
              The value of the duration attribute is set to the value of
              the `duration` argument, if any, otherwise
              the duration of the source score (or the value of `limit`
