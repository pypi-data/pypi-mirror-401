## Background

Work on trinitypython started with an aim to develop functionalities that can be readily plugged into
applications. The application developer should be focussed business use case in mind.
The common functionality should directly be used from the library. This will make code cleaner and
developer can focus more time on quality work.

## Compare Directories

This function will compare two directories. The comparison results can be dumped out as a html report.
The gen_html_report takes an additional list of extensions. If file names match this extension, then
detailed difference for these files will be included in report.
The returned cmp object can also be used to access file differences as list. 4 lists are provided -

1. files_only_in_left
2. dirs_only_in_left
3. files_only_in_right
4. dirs_only_in_right

Directories will be recursively scanned to report the differences.

    from trinitypython.fileutils import compare  
      
    cmp = compare.compare_dirs(r"C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\result_9th",  
                               r"C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\result_9th_v2")  
      
    cmp.gen_html_report(r"C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\out.html", ["py", "txt",  
                                                                     "json"])  
      
    for fl in cmp.files_only_in_right:  
        if fl.name.endswith("py"):  
            print(fl.absolute())

## Compare Files

This function is used to compare files. it is a convenient wrapper around difflib library. It takes
as input file1, file2 and the output file where html report will be saved.

    from trinitypython.fileutils import compare
    
    compare.compare_files(r"C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\spark\b.py",
                          r"C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\spark\c.py",
                          r"C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\spark\out.html")

## Disk cleanup

This function is a helper to assist in clearing up space on disk. The retrieve_info is to be called
on directory that needs to be cleaned. This will scan all files recursively. Post this, the object returned
by retrieve_info can be used to perform additional operations.

1. sort_by_time - Gets the files sorted by modified time ascending
2. sort_by_size - Gets the files sorted by filesize in descending order
3. modified_within - Gets the files modified within provided minutes
4. modified_before - Gets the files modified before provided minutes
5. sort_by_file_count - Gets directories sorted by number of files within the directory in descending order

All the files are returned as Path objects

    from trinitypython.fileutils import cleanup
    
    dr = r"C:\Users\Dell\OneDrive\Desktop\result_9th"
    
    info = cleanup.retrieve_info(dr)
    
    print("sorted by time")
    for dtl in info.sort_by_time()[:5]:
        print(dtl)
    
    print("\nsorted by size")
    for dtl in info.sort_by_size()[:5]:
        print(dtl)
    
    print("\nmodified in last 30 mins")
    for dtl in info.modified_within(mins=30)[:5]:
        print(dtl)
    
    print("\nmodified more than 1 day ago")
    for dtl in info.modified_before(mins=24 * 60)[:5]:
        print(dtl)
    
    print("\nsorted by number of files in directory")
    for dtl in info.sort_by_file_count()[:5]:
        print(dtl)

## Extract URLs from excel file

This function generates an extract of all hyperlinks present in an excel file. It extracts
both explicit ( where hyperlink is attached to cell ) and implicit ( where text content is
a http or https link ). Report contains file name, sheet name, row number, column name, type ( explicit
or implicit ), hyperlink text and hyperlink URL.

    import trinitypython.fileutils.excel as mdexcel
    import json
    from trinitypython.datautils import jsonutil
    
    # Get URLs
    xl = mdexcel.Excel(r"c:\users\dell\onedrive\desktop\dummy_data.xlsx")
    urls = xl.extract_urls(["A", "B"])
    print(json.dumps(urls['data'], indent=2))
    
    # Save as CSV
    jsonutil.list_to_csv(urls['data'], r"c:\users\dell\onedrive\desktop\out.csv",
                         colkey=urls['keys'])

## Menu based app

Once you have implemented different functions for an application, you can use this function
as a quick and easy wrapper to bind all functions into a menu based application. It uses tkinter
menu. It takes as input a list of 3 value tuples - menu name, sub menu name, function to be called
when user clicks on the sub menu item.

    from datetime import datetime
    from random import randint, choice
    from trinitypython.uiutils import menu_based_app
    
    def show_date():
        print(datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))
    
    
    def show_time():
        print(datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S"))
    
    
    def show_date_and_time():
        print(datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
    
    
    def show_random_number():
        print(randint(1, 100))
    
    
    def show_random_color():
        print(choice(['red', 'blue', 'green']))
    
    
    ar = [
        ["Random", "Random Integer", show_random_number],
        ["Random", "Random Color", show_random_color],
        ["Date", "Show Date", show_date],
        ["Date", "Show Time", show_time],
        ["Date", "Show Date and Time", show_date_and_time]
    ]
    
    menu_based_app.start(ar)

## Getting execution duration

A 'timer' object is provided to set it on or off for different user defined names. This can be used to
get a report of execution times of a function or block of statements. call timer.start('somename') when
you want to start timer and timer.stop('somename') when you want to stop timer. call timer.show() to get a
report of execution times. More than one timer can be set in the same program by passing different names.
If the timer.start is called within a loop body, then execution times will be reported as different iterations.

    from trinitypython.debugutils import timer
    from random import randint
    from math import factorial
    
    timer.start("main")
    
    def count_elements_in_array():
        ar = list(range(randint(1000000,10000000)))
        print(len(ar))
    
    def get_factorial():
        for i in range(5):
            timer.start("looptest")
            num = randint(900,1000)
            print(num, factorial(num))
            timer.stop("looptest")
    
    timer.start("func1")
    count_elements_in_array()
    timer.stop("func1")
    
    get_factorial()
    
    timer.stop("main")
    
    timer.show()

## Print current position

This function comes in handy while debugging using print. Instead of manually writting print statements
and thinking what to write after print to pinpoint to the position, we can simply write curpos.show(). This
makes it easy to delete the lines later as print statements can be part of programs or debug. But curpos will
only be part of debug. To temporarily disable debug, write curpos.disable_show() at the beginning of program.
This will suppress all curpos.show() messages.

    from trinitypython.debugutils import curpos
    from random import randint
    from math import factorial
    
    
    def count_elements_in_array():
        ar = list(range(randint(1000000, 10000000)))
        print(len(ar))
    
    
    def get_factorial():
        for i in range(5):
            num = randint(900, 1000)
            print(num, factorial(num))
            curpos.show()
    
    
    count_elements_in_array()
    curpos.show()
    
    get_factorial()

## Track package changes

This function is used to identify changes to installed python library versions over a period
of time. Periodically call version.save to save a dump of current version details for all
installed packages in a JSON file. Pass the directory where a time stamped JSON file will be created.
If any version issue occurs in future or if we want to check if there are any changes to installed
versions, call version.timeline to get timeline of what was changed and when. Call version.compare to see
what has changed after the latest snapshot and now.

    from trinitypython.debugutils import version
    
    version.save("app_dev", r"D:\data\version")
    version.timeline("app_dev", r"D:\data\version")
    version.compare("app_dev", r"D:\data\version")

## Search for functions

This functions scans through docstrings to search for text within them. To get of elements, call
list_elements function and pass object, search string. To also see relevant documentation, pass
showdoc=True

    import pandas as pd
    from trinitypython.debugutils import find
    
    a = [1,2]
    b = {"k": 1}
    s = pd.Series(range(10))
    
    find.search_function(pd, "")
    find.list_elements(s, "truncate", showdoc=True)

## System load simulator

This functions simulates memory and cpu load on the system.

      from trinitypython.debugutils import load
      
      if __name__ == "__main__":
          load.simulate_load(10, 256, 60)

## Flatten JSON

This function is used to flatten a nested JSON into a single key value pair flat JSON. Nested keys are
flattened to . notation. So {"car":{"color":"red"}} will be flattened to {"car.color": "red"}. Nested
arrays are flattened to position. So {"car": [{"color": "red"}, {"color": "blue"}]} will be flattened to
{"car.0.color": "red", "car.1.color": "blue"}

    from trinitypython.datautils import jsonutil
    import json
    
    json_data = {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30,
        "car": {
            "make": "Toyota",
            "model": "Camry"
        },
        "colors": ["red", "blue", "green"],
        "nested_list": [
            [1, 2, 3],
            {"hello": "world"},
            [[7, 8], [9, 10]],
            [[[11, 12], [13, 14]], [[], [17, 18]]]
        ],
        "nested_dict": {
            "info1": {"key1": "value1"},
            "info2": {"key2": "value2"}
        },
        "list_of_dicts": [
            {"item1": "value1"},
            {"item2": "value2"}
        ]
    }
    
    flattened_data = jsonutil.flatten_json(json_data)
    print(json.dumps(flattened_data, indent=2))

## List of JSON object to CSV file

This functions flattens a nested JSON and dumps it into a csv file. Flattening happens in same fashion
as described in [Flatten JSON](#flatten-json). Each unique key forms a column in the CSV file.

    from trinitypython.datautils import jsonutil
    
    out_fl = r"C:\Users\Dell\Onedrive\Desktop\out.csv"
    
    json_data = [
        {
            "name": "John",
            "age": 30,
            "car": {
                "make": "Toyota",
                "model": "Camry"
            },
            "colors": ["red", "blue", "green"]
        }, {
            "name": "Sheema",
            "age": 25,
            "car": {
                "make": "Audi",
                "model": "a4",
                "dimension": [5000, 1850, 1433]
            },
            "colors": ["blue", "yellow"]
        }, {
            "name": "Bruce",
            "car": {
                "make": "Ford"
            }
        }
    ]
    
    jsonutil.list_to_csv(json_data, out_fl)

[Back to contents](#table-of-contents)

## Search for text inside JSON data

This function searches for text within a nested JSON. Both keys and values are searched for the
provided text. The output is returned as a list of flattened JSON for matched values. flattening
rules are same as applied in [Flatten JSON](#flatten-json)

    from trinitypython.datautils import jsonutil
    
    json_data = {
        "data": [
            {
                "name": "John",
                "age": 30,
                "car": {
                    "make": "Toyota",
                    "model": "Camry"
                },
                "colors": ["red", "blue", "green"]
            }, {
                "name": "Sheema",
                "age": 25,
                "car": {
                    "make": "Audi",
                    "model": "a4",
                    "dimension": [5000, 1850, 1433]
                },
                "colors": ["blue", "yellow"]
            }, {
                "name": "Bruce",
                "car": {
                    "make": "Ford"
                }

## Get all objects for a particular key in JSON

This function recursively searches through a nested JSON and returns a list of all values
corresponding to provided key.

    from trinitypython.datautils import jsonutil

    json_data = {
        "data": [
            {

## Reconcile bills and payments

This function reconciles payments against bills. It uses a 4 step approach to match bills and payments

1. First payments with exact amount with date greater than or equal to bill date are mapped
2. Discount percentages can be passed as a list to the function to provide discount on final bill amount
3. If addition of more than one payment with date same or after bill amount matches value, then it is mapped.
   Similarly if addition of more than one bill amount matches a payment amount on or after bill date, then it
   is mapped.
4. Remaining payments are distributed across bills on a first come first serve basis where payment date is
   greater than or equal to bill date

The function requires 2 dataframes, one for payment and one for bill. 4 columns are required - bill date, bill amount
, payment date and payment amount.
