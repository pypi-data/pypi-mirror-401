   window.location.href = login_url
   
   # New
   response = await client.login(redirect="http://localhost:3000/auth/callback", state="abc123")
   if response.get("success"):
       login_url = response["data"]["loginUrl"]
       state = response["data"]["state"]
       window.location.href = login_url
   ```

2. **Update logout() calls**: Add token parameter and handle response

   ```python
   # Old
   await client.logout()
   
   # New
   token = get_token_from_storage()  # Get user's access token
   response = await client.logout(token=token)
   if response.get("success"):
       print("Logout successful")

   - `parsePaginationParams(params)` - Returns dict with `currentPage` and `pageSize` keys
   - `createMetaObject(...)` - Creates `Meta` objects with camelCase fields
   - `transformError(...)` - Transforms error dictionaries to `ErrorResponse` objects
   - `handleApiError(...)` - Creates `ApiErrorException` from API error responses

2. **Configure Audit Logging** (optional): You can now configure audit logging behavior

   ```python
   from miso_client.models.config import AuditConfig, MisoClientConfig
   
   config = MisoClientConfig(
       controller_url="https://controller.example.com",
       client_id="your-client-id",
       client_secret="your-secret",
       audit=AuditConfig(
           enabled=True,
           level="detailed",
           maxResponseSize=5000,
           batchSize=20,
           batchInterval=200
       )
   )
   ```

3. **Handle Exception Type**: `handleApiError()` returns `ApiErrorException`
   - `error = handleApiError(...)` → `ApiErrorException` (extends `MisoClientError`)
   - `ApiErrorException` provides structured error information with camelCase fields

### Testing

- All 409 unit tests passing
- 86% code coverage
- Comprehensive test coverage for all new camelCase functions
- Test coverage for `AuditLogQueue` and audit configuration options
- All audit logging optimizations tested

  - Automatic audit logging for all HTTP requests (`http.request.{METHOD}` format)
  - Debug logging when `log_level === 'debug'` with detailed request/response information
  - Automatic data masking using `DataMasker` before logging (ISO 27001 compliant)
  - All request headers are masked (Authorization, x-client-token, Cookie, etc.)
  - All request bodies are recursively masked for sensitive fields (password, token, secret, SSN, etc.)
  - All response bodies are masked (limited to first 1000 characters)
  - Query parameters are automatically masked
  - Error messages are masked if they contain sensitive data
  - Sensitive endpoints (`/api/logs`, `/api/auth/token`) are excluded from audit logging to prevent infinite loops
  - JWT user ID extraction from Authorization headers for audit context
  - Request duration tracking for performance monitoring
  - Request/response size tracking for observability

- **JSON Configuration Support for DataMasker**: Enhanced `DataMasker` with JSON configuration file support for sensitive fields

  - Categories: authentication, pii, security
  - Support for custom configuration path via `MISO_SENSITIVE_FIELDS_CONFIG` environment variable
  - `DataMasker.set_config_path()` method for programmatic configuration
  - Automatic merging of JSON fields with hardcoded defaults (fallback if JSON cannot be loaded)
  - Backward compatible - existing hardcoded fields still work as fallback

- **New InternalHttpClient Class**: Separated core HTTP functionality into `InternalHttpClient` class
  - Pure HTTP functionality with automatic client token management (no logging)
  - Used internally by public `HttpClient` for actual HTTP requests
  - Used by `LoggerService` for sending logs to prevent circular dependencies

  - New: `HttpClient(config, logger)`
  - This is handled automatically when using `MisoClient` - no changes needed for typical usage
  - Only affects code that directly instantiates `HttpClient`

- **Breaking Change: LoggerService Constructor**: `LoggerService` constructor now uses `InternalHttpClient` instead of `HttpClient`
  - Old: `LoggerService(http_client: HttpClient, redis: RedisService)`
  - New: `LoggerService(internal_http_client: InternalHttpClient, redis: RedisService)`
  - This is handled automatically when using `MisoClient` - no changes needed for typical usage
  - Prevents circular dependency (LoggerService uses InternalHttpClient for log sending)

- **MisoClient Architecture**: Updated `MisoClient` constructor to use new HttpClient architecture
  - Creates `InternalHttpClient` first (pure HTTP functionality)
  - Creates `LoggerService` with `InternalHttpClient` (prevents circular dependency)
  - Creates public `HttpClient` wrapping `InternalHttpClient` with logger (adds audit/debug logging)

- **DataMasker Enhancement**: Updated `DataMasker` to load sensitive fields from JSON configuration
  - Maintains backward compatibility with hardcoded fields as fallback
  - Automatic loading on first use with caching
  - Support for custom configuration paths

### ISO 27001 Compliance Features

- **Automatic Data Masking**: All sensitive data is automatically masked before logging
  - Request headers: Authorization, x-client-token, Cookie, Set-Cookie, and any header containing sensitive keywords
  - Request bodies: Recursively masks password, token, secret, SSN, creditcard, CVV, PIN, OTP, API keys, etc.
  - Response bodies: Especially important for error responses that might contain sensitive data
  - Query parameters: Automatically extracted and masked
  - Error messages: Masked if containing sensitive data

- **Audit Log Structure**: Standardized audit log format for all HTTP requests
  - Action: `http.request.{METHOD}` (e.g., `http.request.GET`, `http.request.POST`)
  - Resource: Request URL path
  - Context: method, url, statusCode, duration, userId, requestSize, responseSize, error (all sensitive data masked)

- **Debug Log Structure**: Detailed debug logging when `log_level === 'debug'`
  - All audit context fields plus: requestHeaders, responseHeaders, requestBody, responseBody (all masked)
  - Additional context: baseURL, timeout, queryParams (all sensitive data masked)

### Technical Improvements

- Improved error handling: Logging errors never break HTTP requests (all errors caught and swallowed)
- Performance: Async logging that doesn't block request/response flow
- Safety: Sensitive endpoints excluded from audit logging to prevent infinite loops
- Flexibility: Configurable sensitive fields via JSON configuration file
