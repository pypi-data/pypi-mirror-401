# Public API: loop implementation
#
# The main logic is that each time coroutine yields, we create a `_WaitingFor` object which holds a counter for how many
# things it is waiting on before it can wake up. Once this counter hits zero, the `_WaitingFor` object schedules the
# coroutine back on the loop.
# Counters can be decremented in three ways: another coroutine finishes, an `Event.set()` is triggered, or a timeout in
# `Event.wait(timeout=...)` is triggered.

            and shut down the loop), then this determines the kind of exception raised out of the loop:
            - if `False` then raise just that error, silently ignoring any errors that occur when cancelling the other
                coroutines.
            - if `True` then always raise a `{Base}ExceptionGroup`, whose first sub-exception will be the original
                error, and whose later sub-exceptions will be any errors that occur whilst cancelling the other
                coroutines. (Including all the `tinyio.CancelledError`s that indicate successful cancellation.)
            - if `None` (the default) then raise just the original error if all other coroutines shut down successfully,
