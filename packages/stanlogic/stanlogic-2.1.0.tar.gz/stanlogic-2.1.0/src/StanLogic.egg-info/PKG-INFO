## Overview

StanLogic is a Python package dedicated to Boolean expression simplification and logical reasoning. It provides computational tools that bridge mathematical formalism and algorithmic implementation for digital logic, electronics, and computer science education.

The project aims to serve as a pedagogical and research tool, offering students, educators, and developers a clear computational framework for analyzing and minimizing Boolean logic.

## Research Background

StanLogic is part of an ongoing research initiative by ```Stan's Technologies```, focused on computational models in logic, electronics, and algorithm design. The motivation behind this work is to create open-source computational models that can aid teaching, research, and local problem-solving in Africa and beyond.

This project demonstrates how algorithmic engineering can make mathematical and electronic concepts tangible through simulation and software. The goal is to advance computational literacy by showing how complex logic principles can be represented in executable form.

## Modules within the Package

1. ```BoolMin2D``` – An algorithmic implementation for solving 2D K-maps (2 to 4) variables. 

2. ```BoolMinGeo``` - A geometric clustering algorithm for simplifying Boolean systems greater than 4 variables. Also contains a purely hireachical method for systems greater than 10 variables where geometric clustering fails. 

3. ```BoolMinHcal``` - An algorithm for simplifying Boolean systems greater than 16 variables, where geometric methods fail.

### Documentation and Test Files

- A research paper formulating the proofs and explaining the mathematical concepts behind the algorithms is currently in development, to be published on ArXiv soon.
- Documentation can be found here for the 2D minimization method: [kmapsolver.md](docs/kmapsolver.md)
- Test files can be found here: [kmapsolver tests](tests/)

The documentation provides extensive guides on the thought processes behind the costruction of the algorithm, key optimizations, and future research directions. 

The test files show how the methods within the algorithm may be used, as well as benchmark test cases against ```SymPy```, and the corresponding output
