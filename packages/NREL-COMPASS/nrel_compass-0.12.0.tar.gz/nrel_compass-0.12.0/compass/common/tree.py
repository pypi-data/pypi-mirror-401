class AsyncDecisionTree(DecisionTree):
    """Async class to traverse a directed graph of LLM prompts

    Nodes of this tree are prompts, and edges are transitions between
    prompts based on conditions being met in the LLM response

    Purpose:
        Represent a series of prompts that can be used in sequence to
        extract values of interest from text.
    Responsibilities:
        1. Store all prompts used to extract a particular ordinance
           value from text.
        2. Track relationships between the prompts (i.e. which prompts
           is used first, which prompt is used next depending on the
           output of the previous prompt, etc.) using a directed acyclic
           graph.
    Key Relationships:
        Inherits from :class:`~elm.tree.DecisionTree` to add ``async``
        capabilities. Uses a ChatLLMCaller for LLm queries.

        Parameters
        ----------
        graph : networkx.DiGraph
            Directed acyclic graph where nodes are LLM prompts and edges
            are logical transitions based on the response. Must have
            high-level graph attribute "chat_llm_caller" which is a
            ChatLLMCaller instance. Nodes should have attribute "prompt"
            which can have {format} named arguments that will be filled
            from the high-level graph attributes. Edges can have
            attribute "condition" that is a callable to be executed on
            the LLM response text. An edge from a node without a
            condition acts as an "else" statement if no other edge
            conditions are satisfied. A single edge from node to node
            does not need a condition.
        usage_sub_label : str, optional
            Optional label to classify LLM usage under when running this
            decision tree. If ``None``, will simply label calls made
            from this tree under "decision_tree". By default, ``None``.
