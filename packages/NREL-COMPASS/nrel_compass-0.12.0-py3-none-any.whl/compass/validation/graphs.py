    Parameters
    ----------
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments forwarded to
        :func:`compass.common.base.setup_graph_no_nodes`. The helper
        consumes ``doc_is_from_ocr`` (default ``False``) to alter
        draft-detection prompts for scanned documents.

    Returns
    -------
    networkx.DiGraph
        Graph suitable for constructing an ``elm.tree.DecisionTree``
        that distinguishes legally binding ordinances from draft,
        planning, meeting, and similar documents.

    -----
    The resulting graph encodes a structured sequence of Yes/No prompts
    that culminate in a JSON response containing summary metadata and a
    legal-text boolean.

    Parameters
    ----------

        Jurisdiction descriptor supplying state, county, and subdivision
