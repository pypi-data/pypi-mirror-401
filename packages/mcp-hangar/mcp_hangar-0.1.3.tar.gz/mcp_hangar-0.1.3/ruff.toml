# Goal: Keep linting strict across the codebase while allowing a small number of
# intentional patterns used for backwards-compatibility / legacy APIs.

# Match line length with black/isort configuration
line-length = 120

# Use ruff's default ruleset selection as invoked in CI (ruff check ...).
# We only configure targeted per-file ignores here.

[lint]
# Intentionally allow "imported but unused" in legacy modules that exist purely
# to re-export symbols for backwards compatibility.
