## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.3] - 2026-01-14

## [0.1.2] - 2026-01-13

### Added
- **Langfuse Integration**: Optional LLM observability with Langfuse
  - Full trace lifecycle management (start, end, error handling)
  - Span nesting for tool invocations and provider operations
  - Automatic score recording for health checks and success rates
  - Graceful degradation when Langfuse is unavailable
  - Configuration via environment variables or config file

- **Testcontainers Support**: Production-grade integration testing
  - PostgreSQL, Redis, Prometheus, Langfuse container fixtures
  - Custom MCP provider container fixtures
  - Conditional loading - tests work without testcontainers installed

### Changed
- **Monitoring Stack Simplified**: Cleaner configuration structure
  - Combined critical/warning alerts into single `alerts.yaml`
  - Added Grafana datasource provisioning
  - Removed obsolete `version` attribute from docker-compose

### Fixed
- Fixed testcontainers import error in CI when library not installed
- Fixed Prometheus metrics `info` type (changed to `gauge` for compatibility)
- Fixed import sorting across all modules (ruff isort)
- Fixed documentation links to point to GitHub Pages
- Removed unused imports and variables

## [0.1.1] - 2026-01-12

### Added
- **Observability Module**: Comprehensive monitoring and tracing support
  - OpenTelemetry distributed tracing with OTLP/Jaeger export
  - Extended Prometheus metrics (circuit breaker, retry, queue depth, SLIs)
  - Kubernetes-compatible health endpoints (`/health/live`, `/health/ready`, `/health/startup`)
  - Pre-built Grafana dashboard for overview metrics
  - Prometheus alert rules (critical and warning)
  - Alertmanager configuration template
  - Documentation at `docs/guides/OBSERVABILITY.md`

- **Provider Groups**: Load balancing and high availability for multiple providers
  - Group multiple providers of the same type into a single logical unit
  - Five load balancing strategies: `round_robin`, `weighted_round_robin`, `least_connections`, `random`, `priority`
  - Automatic member health tracking with configurable thresholds
  - Group-level circuit breaker for cascading failure protection
  - Automatic retry on failure with different member selection
  - New tools: `registry_group_list`, `registry_group_rebalance`
  - Transparent API - existing tools work seamlessly with groups
  - Domain events for group lifecycle: `GroupCreated`, `GroupMemberAdded`, `GroupStateChanged`, etc.
  - Comprehensive documentation in `docs/PROVIDER_GROUPS.md`

## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-16

### Added
- Initial open source release
- Hot-loading MCP provider management with automatic lifecycle control
- Multiple transport modes: Stdio (default) and HTTP with Streamable HTTP support
- Container support for Docker and Podman with auto-detection
- Pre-built image support for running any Docker/Podman image directly
- Thread-safe operations with proper locking mechanisms
- Health monitoring with active health checks and circuit breaker pattern
- Automatic garbage collection for idle provider shutdown
- Provider state machine: `COLD → INITIALIZING → READY → DEGRADED → DEAD`
- Registry MCP tools: `registry_list`, `registry_start`, `registry_stop`, `registry_invoke`, `registry_tools`, `registry_details`, `registry_health`
- Comprehensive security features:
  - Input validation at API boundaries
  - Command injection prevention
  - Rate limiting with token bucket algorithm
  - Secrets management with automatic masking
  - Security audit logging
- Domain-Driven Design architecture with CQRS pattern
- Event sourcing support for provider state management
- Subprocess mode for local MCP server processes
- Container mode with security hardening (dropped capabilities, read-only filesystem, no-new-privileges)
- Volume mount support with blocked sensitive paths
- Resource limits (memory, CPU) for container providers
- Network isolation options (none, bridge, host)
- Example math provider for testing
- Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, feature, performance tests)
- GitHub Actions CI/CD for linting and testing (Python 3.11-3.14)
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality (black, isort, ruff)
- Docker and docker-compose support for containerized deployment
- Extensive documentation:
  - API reference
  - Architecture overview
  - Security guide
  - Contributing guide
  - Docker support guide

### Security
- Input validation for all provider IDs, tool names, and arguments
- Command sanitization to prevent shell injection attacks
- Environment variable filtering to remove sensitive data
- Rate limiting to prevent denial of service
- Audit logging for security-relevant events
