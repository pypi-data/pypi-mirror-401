A high-performance Python library for sparse Graph Signal Processing (GSP) and Spectral Graph Wavelet Transforms (SGWT). This package leverages the ``CHOLMOD`` library for efficient sparse direct solvers, providing significant speedups over traditional dense or iterative methods for large-scale graph convolution.

Key Features
------------

- **High-Performance Sparse Solvers**: Direct integration with the ``CHOLMOD`` library for optimized sparse Cholesky factorizations and linear system solves.
- **Generalized Graph Convolution**: Support for arbitrary spectral kernels via rational approximation (Kernel Fitting), polynomial approximation (Chebyshev), and standard analytical filters (low-pass, band-pass, high-pass).
- **Dynamic Topology Support**: Specialized routines for graphs with evolving structures, utilizing efficient rank-1 updates for real-time topology changes.
- **Resource-Aware Execution**: Context-managed memory allocation and workspace reuse to minimize overhead in high-throughput applications.
- **Integrated Graph Repository**: Built-in access to standardized graph Laplacians and signals from power systems and infrastructure networks.

Installation
------------

You can install ``sgwt`` from the `Python Package Index (PyPI) <https://pypi.org/project/sgwt/>`_:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sgwt



Documentation
-------------

For detailed usage, API reference, and theoretical background, please visit the `documentation website <https://sgwt.readthedocs.io/>`_.

Usage Example
-------------

Here is a quick example of applying a band-pass filter to an impulse signal on the built-in synthetic Texas grid Laplacian.

.. code-block:: python

    import sgwt

    # 1. Load a built-in graph Laplacian, which defines the graph's topology.
    L = sgwt.DELAY_TEXAS

    # 2. Create a vertex-domain signal. Here, a Dirac impulse on the 600th vertex.
    #    The `impulse` helper function ensures the required column-major memory order.
    signal = sgwt.impulse(L, n=600)

    # 3. Use the static convolution context manager. This performs a one-time
    #    symbolic factorization of the Laplacian for efficient repeated solves.
    with sgwt.Convolve(L) as conv:
        # 4. Apply an analytical band-pass filter. The scale parameter controls
        #    the filter's center frequency.
        filtered_signals = conv.bandpass(signal, scales=[10.0])

    # 5. The result is a list of filtered signals, one for each input scale.
    result = filtered_signals[0]

    print(f"Graph has {L.shape[0]} vertices.")
    print(f"Signal on vertex 600, shape: {signal.shape}")
    print(f"Filtered signal shape: {result.shape}")

More Examples
-------------

The `examples/ <https://github.com/lukelowry/sgwt/tree/main/examples>`_ directory contains a comprehensive suite of demonstrations, also rendered in the `Examples <https://sgwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/examples/static.html>`_ section of the documentation. Key applications include:

- **Static Filtering**: Basic low-pass, band-pass, and high-pass filtering on various graph sizes.
- **Dynamic Graphs**: Real-time topology updates, performance comparisons, and online stream processing.


Testing
-------

The package includes a comprehensive test suite to verify its correctness. To run the tests on an installed version of ``sgwt``, first install the test dependencies and then run pytest:

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install sgwt[test]
    pytest --pyargs sgwt.tests

For more detailed instructions, including how to run tests from a source checkout, see the `Validation Tests <https://sgwt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/dev/tests.html>`_ section in the documentation.
