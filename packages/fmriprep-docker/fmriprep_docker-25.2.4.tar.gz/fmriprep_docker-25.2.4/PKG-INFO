The *fMRIPrep* on Docker wrapper
--------------------------------
fMRIprep is a functional magnetic resonance image pre-processing pipeline
that is designed to provide an easily accessible, state-of-the-art interface
that is robust to differences in scan acquisition protocols and that requires
minimal user input, while providing easily interpretable and comprehensive
error and output reporting.

This is a lightweight Python wrapper to run *fMRIPrep*.
It generates the appropriate Docker commands, providing an intuitive interface
to running the *fMRIPrep* workflow in a Docker environment.
Docker must be installed and running. This can be checked
running ::

  docker info
