================
ScanCode Toolkit
================

ScanCode Toolkit is a set of code scanning tools that detect the origin (copyrights), license and vulnerabilities of code,
packages and dependencies in a codebase. ScanCode Toolkit is an `AboutCode project <https://aboutcode.org>`_.

Why Use ScanCode Toolkit?
=========================

ScanCode Toolkit is the leading tool in scanning depth and accuracy,
used by hundreds of software teams. You can use ScanCode Toolkit
as a command line tool or as a library.

Getting Started
===============

Instructions to get you up and running on your local machine are at `Getting Started <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/getting-started/index.html>`_

The ScanCode Toolkit documentation also provides:

- prerequisites for installing the software.
- instructions guiding you to start scanning code.
- a comprehensive guide to the command line options.
- tutorials that provide hands-on guidance to ScanCode features.
- how to expand ScanCode Licenses and Detection Rules with your own data.
- how to generate Attribution from a ScanCode scan.
- guidelines for contributing to code development.

Build and tests status
======================

We run 30,000+ tests on each commit on multiple CIs to ensure a good platform
compabitility with multiple versions of Windows, Linux and macOS.

Benefits of ScanCode
====================

- ScanCode is heavily **tested** with an automated test suite of over **30,000 tests**.

- ScanCode is **used by several projects and organizations** such as
  the `Eclipse Foundation <https://www.eclipse.org>`_,
  `OpenEmbedded.org <https://www.openembedded.org>`_,
  the `FSFE <https://www.fsfe.org>`_,
  the `FSF <https://www.fsf.org>`_,
  `OSS Review Toolkit <http://oss-review-toolkit.org>`_,
  `ClearlyDefined.io <https://clearlydefined.io/>`_,
  `RedHat Fabric8 analytics <https://github.com/fabric8-analytics>`_,
  and many more.

- You can also organize and run ScanCode server-side with the
  companion `ScanCode.io web app <https://github.com/aboutcode-org/scancode.io>`_
  to organize and store multiple scan projects including scripted scanning pipelines.

- As a **standalone command-line tool**, ScanCode is **easy to install**, run,
  and embed in your CI/CD processing pipeline.
  It runs on **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

- ScanCode detects licenses, copyrights, package manifests, direct dependencies,
  and more both in **source code** and **binary** files and is considered as the
  best-in-class and reference tool in this domain, re-used as the core tools for
  software composition data collection by several open source tools.

- ScanCode provides the **most accurate license detection engine** and does a
  full comparison (also known as diff or red line comparison) between a database
  of license texts and your code instead of relying only on approximate regex
  patterns or probabilistic search, edit distance or machine learning.

- Written in Python, ScanCode is **easy to extend with plugins** to contribute
  new and improved scanners, data summarization, package manifest parsers, and
  new outputs.

- You can save your scan results as **JSON, YAML, HTML, CycloneDX or SPDX** or
  even create your own format with Jinja templates.

- ScanCode can process packages, build manifest and lockfile formats to collect
  Package URLs and extract metadata. See all available `package parsers
  <https://scancode-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/index.html>`_
  for the exhaustive list.
