notes: gibberish.py is a reorganization of the code at
 https://github.com/rrenaud/Gibberish-Detector into an object oriented class.
 gibberish.py was originally a Python script written by Rob Renaud as a solution
 to a stack overflow question (https://stackoverflow.com/a/6298193). The original
 repo at https://github.com/rrenaud/Gibberish-Detector has been cloned many times
 and has been expanded upon by multiple authors. This instance of gibberish.py
 was maintained by Iakov Pustilnik, where it was cloned from
 https://github.com/yapus/gibberish, which was cloned from
 https://github.com/vsobolmaven/gibberish, which was cloned from
 https://github.com/mgreenw/gibberish, which was cloned from
 https://github.com/pjanata/Gibberish-Detector, and ultimately all of these repos
 are from https://github.com/rrenaud/Gibberish-Detector
