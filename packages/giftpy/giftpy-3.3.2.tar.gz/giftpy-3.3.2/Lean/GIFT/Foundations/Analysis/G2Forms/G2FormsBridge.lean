GIFT Tier 2.5: G2 Forms Bridge
===============================

This module connects:
- **Tier 1**: Abstract differential forms (G2Structure, TorsionFree)
- **Tier 2**: Concrete cross product (epsilon, phi0, Lagrange identity)

## Mathematical Content

The canonical G₂ 3-form φ₀ on ℝ⁷ is:
  φ₀ = ∑_{(i,j,k) ∈ Fano} eⁱ ∧ eʲ ∧ eᵏ

where the Fano plane lines determine the structure constants ε(i,j,k).

The cross product is recovered via interior product:
  u × v = (u ⌟ (v ⌟ φ₀))♯

## Key Results

1. `phi0_coefficients`: The 35 independent coefficients of φ₀
2. `psi0_coefficients`: The 35 coefficients of ψ₀ = ⋆φ₀
3. `CrossProductG2`: Canonical G₂ structure from cross product
4. `crossProductG2_matches_phi0`: The structures agree
5. `cross_from_phi_contraction`: u × v from φ₀ contraction

The key identity: for u, v ∈ ℝ⁷,
  (u × v)_k = ∑_{i,j} ε(i,j,k) u_i v_j = (v ⌟ (u ⌟ φ₀))_k

This shows the cross product is encoded in the 3-form.

## Part 6: G₂ as Automorphisms of Cross Product

G₂ is characterized as the group preserving both:
1. The cross product: g(u × v) = gu × gv
2. The 3-form φ₀: g*φ₀ = φ₀

These are equivalent characterizations.
