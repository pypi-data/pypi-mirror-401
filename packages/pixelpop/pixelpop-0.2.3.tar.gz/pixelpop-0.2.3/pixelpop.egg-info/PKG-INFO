# PixelPop

Package for nonparameteric (AKA weakly modeled, data-driven) Bayesian inference of a gravitational wave population, built on `JAX` and `numpyro`. 
Aimed particularly at correlated nonparameteric inference in spaces with dimension 2-3.

This method works by binning the space into a cartesian grid, and inferring the log-rate density in each bin, each of which is a free parameter. 
Each bin is coupled to its nearest-neighbors using an intrinsic conditional-autoregressive (ICAR) model.

The dimension of the inference problem can become very large (e.g. 10^4 for a 2-dimensional space with a density of 100 bins along each axis), and 
we leverage auto-differentiation and GPU acceleration in `JAX`, as well as the efficient No-U-Turn HMC sampler in `numpyro` to sample the posterior.
