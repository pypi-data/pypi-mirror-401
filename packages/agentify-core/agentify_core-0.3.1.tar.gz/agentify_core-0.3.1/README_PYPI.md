# Agentify


**Independent AI agent library based on the OpenAI SDK**

Agentify is a Python library for building and orchestrating AI agents, from simple assistants to complex multi-agent systems. It targets the OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions interface, enabling support for multiple providers through a configurable `base_url` (OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, DeepSeek, Gemini, etc.). Agentify offers a streamlined, independent set of primitives for memory, tools, and coordination so you can focus on product logic without being tied to heavy frameworks.


## Why Agentify?

- **Built for production**: clear abstractions, explicit configuration, error handling and extension points that map well to real deployments.
- **Orchestration-first design**: a uniform `run()` interface for agents, teams, pipelines and hierarchies makes it straightforward to compose and refactor flows.
- **Providers**: switch between OpenAI, Gemini, Azure OpenAI, DeepSeek, Claude and others without changing your agent code.


## Key Features

- **Agents and multi-agent patterns**  
  Single Agents with tools and memory, supervisor–worker Multi-Agent Teams, Sequential Pipelines where output flows from step to step, Hierarchical Structures for complex delegation, and Dynamic Flows where a controller decides at runtime which sub-agents or teams to invoke.

- **Memory service and isolation**  
  Pluggable backends (in-memory, Redis, …) with per-use-case policies (TTL, maximum messages, etc.), plus optional memory isolation so each agent can maintain its own conversation history for scalability and privacy.

- **Reasoning Models**  
  Configure the model's thinking depth, safely merge `model_kwargs`, automatically store
  "Chain of Thought" in conversation history, and log reasoning steps in real-time for visibility.

- **Tools and actions**  
  Simple `@tool` decorator for creating tools from functions with automatic JSON Schema generation, or type-annotated tool interface for custom implementations.

- **Observability hooks**  
  Callback system for logging, monitoring and debugging agent behaviour across complex flows.

- **I/O capabilities**  
  Streaming support for real-time responses and vision/image models for multimodal interactions.

- **Async & Parallel Execution**  
  Built-in `async/await` support (`arun()`) for all agents and flows. Automatically executes independent tool calls in parallel (e.g., fetching data from 3 APIs simultaneously), significantly reducing latency.


## Installation

```bash
pip install agentify-core
```

For optional features:
```bash
pip install agentify-core[all]  # Installs all optional dependencies
```

## Quick Start

```python
from agentify import BaseAgent, AgentConfig, MemoryService, MemoryAddress, tool
from agentify.memory.stores import InMemoryStore

# 1. Create a simple tool with @tool decorator
@tool
def get_time() -> dict:
    """Returns the current time."""
    from datetime import datetime
    return {"time": datetime.now().strftime("%H:%M:%S")}

# 2. Create memory service
memory = MemoryService(store=InMemoryStore(), log_enabled=True, max_log_length=100)
addr = MemoryAddress(conversation_id="session_1")

# 3. Create an Agent with the tool
agent = BaseAgent(
    config=AgentConfig(
        name="ReasoningAgent",
        system_prompt="You are a helpful assistant.",
        provider="provider",
        model_name="model",
        reasoning_effort="high",  # optional param:"low", "medium", "high"
        model_kwargs={"max_completion_tokens": 5000} # Pass model-specific params
    ),
    memory=memory,
    memory_address=addr,
    tools=[get_time]  # Add your tools here
)

# 4. Run a conversation
response = agent.run(user_input="What time is it?")
```

## Composable Flows

Agentify provides powerful primitives that can be combined to build arbitrarily complex systems:

* **BaseAgent**: The fundamental unit of work.
* **Teams**: A group of agents managed by a supervisor.
* **Pipelines**: A sequence of steps where output passes from one to the next.
* **Hierarchies**: Tree structures for massive delegation.

Because all flows share the same `run()` interface, you can build Teams made of Pipelines, Pipelines made of Teams, and deeply nested Hierarchies.

Agentify supports both **strict workflows** (fixed, pre-defined Pipelines and Hierarchies) and **dynamic agentic flows**, where a supervisor/router agent decides at runtime which agent, Team or Pipeline to call next.
