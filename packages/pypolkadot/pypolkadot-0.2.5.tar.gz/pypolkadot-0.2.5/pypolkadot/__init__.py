pypolkadot - Python light client for Polkadot/Substrate via smoldot.

Connect to Asset Hub trustlessly, without running a full node or relying on RPC providers.

Example:
    >>> from pypolkadot import LightClient
    >>> client = LightClient()                    # Asset Hub Polkadot (default)
    >>> client = LightClient(network="kusama")    # Asset Hub Kusama
    >>> client = LightClient(network="paseo")     # Paseo Asset Hub (testnet)
    >>> for block in client.subscribe_finalized():
    ...     print(f"Block #{block.number}: {block.hash}")
