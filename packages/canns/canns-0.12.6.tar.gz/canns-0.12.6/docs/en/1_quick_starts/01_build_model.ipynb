    "In this library, we implement the mathematically tractable and canonical continuous attractor neural network called the **Wu-Amari-Wong (WAW)** model :cite:p:`amari1977dynamics,wu2008dynamics,fung2010moving,wu2016continuous` as our standard implementation. Thanks to seamless integration with **BrainPy** :cite:p:`wang2023brainpy`—a powerful brain dynamics programming framework built on JAX—building this mathematically rigorous model becomes remarkably simple. This guide shows you how to:\n",
