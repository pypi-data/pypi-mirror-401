# SESAME Project

## About

The **SESAME project** aims to unify key human and non-human (Earth system) datasets into a shared spatially-gridded format. These datasets are often siloed in incompatible formats (eg. csv, tiff, netcdf, shp, etc.); SESAME improves interdisciplinary data discoverability and interoperability for research and modeling the global human system.

## Main Tools

- **`point_2_grid`**  
  Maps point data onto standardized global grids. Supports counting points per cell, summing or averaging associated values, or grouping by class to generate multi-variable datasets.

- **`line_2_grid`**  
  Maps line data onto global grids by calculating the length of each line segment within grid cells. Supports aggregation methods such as mean, max, or standard deviation through spatial intersections.

- **`poly_2_grid`**  
  Handles polygon data by computing the fraction or area of each polygon that overlaps with each grid cell. Supports combining multiple polygon types into a multi-variable NetCDF output.

- **`grid_2_grid`**  
  Converts raster data to a new grid resolution. Ensures global coverage, checks projections, fills in missing cells with NaNs, and supports aggregation methods like sum, mean, max, min, or standard deviation.

- **`table_2_grid`**  
  Converts jurisdiction-level tabular data into standardized grids using surrogate variables. Accounts for boundary changes over time for accurate spatial representation.

- **`add_iso3_column`**  
  Standardizes country names by converting them to ISO3 codes. This function is a prerequisite for running `table_2_grid`.

- **`grid_2_table`**  
  Reverses the gridding process by aggregating gridded data into summary tables based on predefined regions or countries.

- **Built-in plotting functions**  
  SESAME also includes tools for quick visualization and mapping, such as `plot_histogram`, `plot_scatter`, `plot_time_series`, and `plot_hexbin` for charts, and `plot_map`, `plot_country` for gridded or choropleth maps. These functions help generate both exploratory plots and publication-ready outputs with minimal setup.

## Installation Instructions

If you're using **conda** to manage your Python environment:

### Step 1: Create and activate the environment

```bash
# create a new conda environment
conda create -n sesame_env
# activate the environment
conda activate sesame_env

# Install all geospatial dependencies via conda
conda install -c conda-forge gdal rasterio cartopy geopandas h5netcdf matplotlib
# install SESAME from testPyPI
pip install --index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple/ --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple sesame-iesd==0.1.10
```
### Step 2: Add this as a Python code snippet:
```bash
import sesame as ssm 
```

### If you are using Windows and encounter the error: 
"ERROR: Failed building wheel for cartopy," please follow these steps:

1. Download and install the Microsoft C++ Build Tools from the official website:  
   [https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)

2. During installation, make sure to select the **"Desktop development with C++"** workload.  
   This is required to build packages like cartopy that depend on C++ extensions.
