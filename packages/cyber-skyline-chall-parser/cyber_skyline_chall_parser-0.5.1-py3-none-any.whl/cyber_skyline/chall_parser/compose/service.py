Docker Compose Service Configuration for CTF Challenges

This module defines a simplified Service class that represents a Docker Compose service
specifically tailored for CTF challenge deployment. It focuses on the essential fields
needed for challenge infrastructure while ignoring complex orchestration features.

# Design Notes:
# 
# 1. Security Focus: Many Docker Compose features are intentionally excluded
#    to reduce attack surface and complexity. For example, volume mounts,
#    privileged mode, and host networking are not supported.
#
# 2. Template Integration: The environment field supports Template objects
#    to enable dynamic content generation using the Faker library.
#
# 3. Minimal but Extensible: The class includes only essential fields but
#    provides extension mechanisms for future expansion.
#
# 4. Type Safety: All fields are properly typed to enable static analysis
#    and better development experience.
#
# TODO: Evaluate if init process support is needed for proper signal handling
