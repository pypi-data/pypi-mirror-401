\begin{abstract}
Stopword lists are fundamental resources for Natural Language Processing (NLP), yet they remain scarce for low-resource African languages. This paper presents the first comprehensive, linguistically grounded stopword list for Fulfulde (Adamawa variant), a Niger-Congo language spoken by over 3 million people in Cameroon and Nigeria. We describe our methodology combining corpus-based frequency analysis with expert linguistic validation, resulting in a curated list of 180+ stopwords covering all major grammatical categories. We release this resource as an open-source Python library and evaluate its impact on text classification and information retrieval tasks. Our experiments show that using Fulfulde-specific stopwords improves classification accuracy by 12.3\% and reduces feature dimensionality by 43.7\% compared to no stopword filtering. This work contributes to the growing ecosystem of NLP tools for African languages and provides a replicable methodology for developing similar resources for other low-resource languages.

\section{Introduction}

Stopword removal is a fundamental preprocessing step in many Natural Language Processing (NLP) pipelines. Stopwords---words that carry little semantic content and appear with high frequency---are typically filtered out to reduce noise and computational complexity in tasks such as information retrieval, text classification, and topic modeling \citep{manning2008introduction}. While comprehensive stopword lists exist for major world languages such as English, French, and Arabic, they remain critically lacking for the majority of African languages.

Fulfulde (also known as Fula, Fulani, or Pulaar) is a Niger-Congo language of the Atlantic branch, spoken by 20-25 million people across 20+ countries in West and Central Africa \citep{ethnologue2023}. The Adamawa variant, spoken in Cameroon and Northern Nigeria, represents one of the largest dialectal clusters with approximately 3 million speakers. Despite this substantial speaker population, Fulfulde remains severely under-resourced in terms of NLP tools and linguistic resources.

The lack of basic NLP resources for Fulfulde poses significant challenges:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Limited access to digital services in the language
    \item Barriers to educational technology development
    \item Exclusion from multilingual NLP systems
    \item Inability to process and analyze Fulfulde text at scale
\end{itemize}

This paper addresses this gap by presenting \textbf{the first comprehensive stopword list for Fulfulde (Adamawa variant)}. Our contributions are:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item A linguistically validated stopword list of 180+ words covering all major grammatical categories
    \item A replicable methodology combining corpus analysis with expert validation
    \item An open-source Python library for easy integration into NLP pipelines
    \item Experimental validation on text classification and information retrieval tasks
    \item A foundation for future Fulfulde NLP resource development
\end{enumerate}

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section~\ref{sec:related} reviews related work on stopwords and African language NLP. Section~\ref{sec:linguistic} describes the linguistic characteristics of Fulfulde relevant to stopword identification. Section~\ref{sec:methodology} details our methodology for compiling and validating the stopword list. Section~\ref{sec:resource} presents the resource structure and availability. Section~\ref{sec:evaluation} reports experimental results. Section~\ref{sec:discussion} discusses limitations and future work, and Section~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes.

\section{Related Work}
\label{sec:related}

\subsection{Stopwords in NLP}

Stopword removal has been a standard preprocessing technique since the early days of information retrieval \citep{luhn1958automatic}. Traditional approaches relied on manually curated lists of high-frequency function words \citep{fox1989stopword}. More recent work has explored automated methods based on term frequency analysis \citep{lo2005automatic}, information theory metrics \citep{zou2006identifying}, and machine learning \citep{saif2014stopwords}.

For major languages, standard stopword lists are widely available: NLTK \citep{bird2009natural} provides lists for 16 languages, scikit-learn \citep{pedregosa2011scikit} includes lists for 15 languages, and the Stopwords ISO project\footnote{\url{https://github.com/stopwords-iso/stopwords-iso}} covers 50+ languages. However, these resources remain concentrated in Indo-European and East Asian languages, with minimal coverage of African languages.

\subsection{African Language NLP}

Recent years have seen growing interest in African language NLP, driven by initiatives such as Masakhane \citep{nekoto2020participatory} and the African NLP workshop series. Key resources developed include:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Machine translation datasets for 50+ languages \citep{nekoto2020participatory}
    \item Named entity recognition corpora \citep{adelani2021masakhaner}
    \item Language identification tools \citep{jauhiainen2019automatic}
    \item Speech recognition systems \citep{ogueji2021african}
\end{itemize}

However, basic linguistic resources such as stopword lists remain scarce. To our knowledge, publicly available stopword lists exist for fewer than 10 African languages, including Swahili, Yoruba, and Amharic. This work represents the first such resource for Fulfulde.

\subsection{Fulfulde Language Resources}

Existing Fulfulde language resources are limited:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Descriptive grammars \citep{arnott1970nominal, mcintosh1984fulfulde}
    \item Lexicons and dictionaries \citep{noye1989dictionnaire}
    \item Biblical translations (available in multiple variants)
    \item Small-scale educational materials
\end{itemize}

Digital NLP resources are extremely limited. Recent work includes a small parallel corpus for machine translation \citep{adelani2022thousand} and preliminary work on part-of-speech tagging \citep{dione2014corpus}. Our stopword list represents a foundational contribution to this emerging ecosystem.

\section{Linguistic Background}
\label{sec:linguistic}

\subsection{Fulfulde Overview}

Fulfulde is characterized by several distinctive linguistic features that influence stopword identification:

\subsubsection{Nominal Class System}

Fulfulde has approximately 20-25 nominal classes (depending on analysis), each with corresponding pronouns, determiners, and agreement markers. This contrasts with gender systems in Indo-European languages and results in a large set of grammatical morphemes that function as stopwords.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{llll}
\toprule
\textbf{Class} & \textbf{Singular} & \textbf{Plural} & \textbf{Example} \\
\midrule
O & o & ɓe & gorko (person) \\
Nde & nde & de & puccu (horse) \\
Ndu & ndu & di & mburu (bread) \\
Ndi & ndi & di & laamu (authority) \\
Ka & ka & ɗi & lekki (tree) \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Sample nominal classes in Fulfulde}
\label{tab:nominal_classes}
\end{table}

\subsubsection{Agglutinative Morphology}

Fulfulde exhibits extensive agglutination, with grammatical information encoded through affixes rather than independent function words. However, many grammatical particles remain separate and function as stopwords.

\subsubsection{Word Order and Syntax}

The basic word order is SVO (Subject-Verb-Object) in main clauses, with VSO variation in certain contexts. Relative clauses and subordination involve specific particles that appear frequently in text.

\subsection{Stopword Categories}

Based on Fulfulde grammar, we identify the following categories of potential stopwords:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Personal pronouns}: mi (I), a (you-sg), o (he/she), en (we-excl), on (we-incl), ɓe (they)
    \item \textbf{Demonstratives and deictics}: ɗo, ɗon, oo, ɗum
    \item \textbf{Nominal class pronouns}: All class markers listed in Table~\ref{tab:nominal_classes}
    \item \textbf{Prepositions}: e (with), nder (in), haa (to/until), dow (on)
    \item \textbf{Conjunctions}: bee (and), koo (or), ammaa (but)
    \item \textbf{Auxiliaries}: woni (to be), ɗon (progressive marker), woodi (to have)
    \item \textbf{Negation markers}: ai, ataa, naa, fay
    \item \textbf{Interrogative particles}: mo (who), ko (what), moy (where)
    \item \textbf{Discourse particles}: nden (then), ni (that), boo (please)
    \item \textbf{Tense/aspect markers}: don, no, ma
\end{enumerate}

This taxonomy guided our corpus-based extraction and validation process.

\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

Our methodology combines corpus-based frequency analysis with expert linguistic validation. The process consisted of four main phases:

\subsection{Phase 1: Corpus Collection}

We compiled a Fulfulde corpus from multiple sources to ensure representativeness:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Religious texts}: Bible translation (New Testament), Quranic passages
    \item \textbf{Educational materials}: Primary school textbooks, literacy primers
    \item \textbf{Media}: Radio broadcast transcriptions, news articles
    \item \textbf{Administrative texts}: Government documents, public notices
    \item \textbf{Oral transcriptions}: Folk tales, personal narratives
\end{itemize}

The final corpus comprised approximately 450,000 tokens across diverse genres and registers. All texts were in the Adamawa variant using standard Latin orthography.

\subsection{Phase 2: Frequency Analysis}

We performed frequency analysis using the following procedure:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Tokenization}: Whitespace-based splitting with special handling for clitics and apostrophes
    \item \textbf{Normalization}: Lowercasing and Unicode normalization (NFC form)
    \item \textbf{Frequency counting}: Raw frequency and document frequency for each token
    \item \textbf{Ranking}: Tokens ranked by combined frequency score
\end{enumerate}

Table~\ref{tab:top_words} shows the 20 most frequent words in our corpus.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\small
\begin{tabular}{clrr}
\toprule
\textbf{Rank} & \textbf{Word} & \textbf{Frequency} & \textbf{Doc Freq} \\
\midrule
1 & e & 12,453 & 98.3\% \\
2 & mi & 9,827 & 94.7\% \\
3 & o & 8,956 & 93.2\% \\
4 & ɗum & 7,234 & 89.5\% \\
5 & nder & 6,891 & 87.8\% \\
6 & a & 6,543 & 86.4\% \\
7 & ɓe & 5,987 & 84.2\% \\
8 & ko & 5,654 & 82.9\% \\
9 & haa & 5,321 & 81.3\% \\
10 & en & 4,987 & 79.6\% \\
11-20 & \multicolumn{3}{l}{woni, don, bee, mo, nde, dow, koo, on, am, ɗon} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Top 20 most frequent words in the Fulfulde corpus}
\label{tab:top_words}
\end{table}

\subsection{Phase 3: Linguistic Validation}

High frequency alone is insufficient for stopword identification. We applied linguistic criteria:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Grammatical function}: Does the word serve primarily a grammatical rather than lexical function?
    \item \textbf{Semantic content}: Does the word carry minimal independent meaning?
    \item \textbf{Context independence}: Is the word's occurrence independent of topic/domain?
    \item \textbf{Non-informativeness}: Would removing the word preserve core content?
\end{enumerate}

Two Fulfulde linguists (native speakers with linguistics training) independently reviewed the top 500 frequency-ranked words, classifying each as stopword/content word. Inter-annotator agreement was high (Cohen's κ = 0.89). Disagreements were resolved through discussion.

\subsection{Phase 4: Extension and Refinement}

Beyond high-frequency words, we systematically added:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Complete paradigms for included word classes (e.g., all personal pronouns)
    \item Nominal class markers not in top frequency ranks
    \item Common fused forms (e.g., miɗo = mi + ɗo)
    \item Variant spellings (e.g., nde/ɗe)
\end{itemize}

The final list was reviewed by three additional Fulfulde speakers for completeness and accuracy.

\section{The Resource}
\label{sec:resource}

\subsection{Stopword List Structure}

The final stopword list contains 182 entries organized into 15 grammatical categories (see Table~\ref{tab:categories}). The full list is available in our GitHub repository.

\begin{table}[h]

\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Distribution of stopwords by grammatical category}
\label{tab:categories}
\end{table}

\subsection{Python Library}

We provide an easy-to-use Python library (compatible with Python 3.7+) with the following features:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Basic usage example},label=lst:basic]
from fulfulde_stopwords import get_stopwords, remove_stopwords

# Get all stopwords
stopwords = get_stopwords()

# Remove stopwords from text
tokens = ['mi', 'heɓi', 'wuro', 'e', 'nder']
filtered = remove_stopwords(tokens)
# Result: ['heɓi', 'wuro']
\end{lstlisting}

The library includes:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Stopword retrieval (\texttt{get\_stopwords})
    \item Stopword checking (\texttt{is\_stopword})
    \item Token filtering (\texttt{remove\_stopwords})
    \item Text filtering (\texttt{filter\_text})
    \item Statistics calculation (\texttt{get\_stats})
\end{itemize}

Integration with popular NLP libraries (NLTK, spaCy, scikit-learn) is straightforward:

\begin{lstlisting}[caption={Integration with scikit-learn},label=lst:sklearn]
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from fulfulde_stopwords import get_stopwords

stopwords = list(get_stopwords())
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words=stopwords)
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Availability}

The resource is released under the MIT License and available at:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{GitHub}: \url{https://github.com/2zalab/fulfulde-stopwords}
    \item \textbf{PyPI}: \texttt{pip install fulfulde-stopwords}
    \item \textbf{Documentation}: \url{https://github.com/2zalab/fulfulde-stopwords\#readme}
\end{itemize}

\section{Evaluation}
\label{sec:evaluation}

We evaluate the impact of our stopword list on two NLP tasks: text classification and information retrieval.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}

\subsubsection{Dataset}

We created a Fulfulde text classification dataset with 1,200 documents across 6 categories:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item News (200 documents)
    \item Religion (200 documents)
    \item Education (200 documents)
    \item Health (200 documents)
    \item Agriculture (200 documents)
    \item Culture (200 documents)
\end{itemize}

Documents were collected from diverse sources and manually labeled. We used 80\% for training and 20\% for testing.

\subsubsection{Baselines}

We compare four conditions:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{No filtering}: No stopword removal
    \item \textbf{Frequency-based}: Top 50 most frequent words removed
    \item \textbf{English stopwords}: English stopword list (inappropriate baseline)
    \item \textbf{Fulfulde stopwords}: Our stopword list
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Task 1: Text Classification}

We trained Multinomial Naive Bayes and Linear SVM classifiers using TF-IDF features.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Accuracy} & \textbf{F1-Score} & \textbf{Features} & \textbf{Reduction} \\
\midrule
No filtering & 0.732 & 0.718 & 4,523 & --- \\
Frequency-based & 0.765 & 0.751 & 4,473 & 1.1\% \\
English stopwords & 0.698 & 0.682 & 4,489 & 0.8\% \\
\textbf{Fulfulde stopwords} & \textbf{0.855} & \textbf{0.841} & \textbf{2,547} & \textbf{43.7\%} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Text classification results (Linear SVM)}
\label{tab:classification}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:classification} shows that Fulfulde stopwords significantly improve classification performance (+12.3\% accuracy) while reducing feature dimensionality by 43.7\%.

\subsection{Task 2: Information Retrieval}

We evaluated retrieval performance using TF-IDF similarity on a query set of 50 information needs with manually annotated relevant documents.

\begin{table}[h]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{lcccc}
\toprule
\textbf{Method} & \textbf{MAP} & \textbf{MRR} & \textbf{P@10} & \textbf{nDCG@10} \\
\midrule
No filtering & 0.542 & 0.671 & 0.456 & 0.612 \\
Frequency-based & 0.558 & 0.684 & 0.472 & 0.628 \\
English stopwords & 0.523 & 0.658 & 0.441 & 0.597 \\
\textbf{Fulfulde stopwords} & \textbf{0.631} & \textbf{0.752} & \textbf{0.538} & \textbf{0.701} \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\caption{Information retrieval results}
\label{tab:retrieval}
\end{table}

Table~\ref{tab:retrieval} shows consistent improvements across all IR metrics when using Fulfulde stopwords.

\subsection{Analysis}

The strong performance gains demonstrate that:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item Stopword removal improves both classification and retrieval in Fulfulde
    \item Language-specific stopwords substantially outperform frequency-only approaches
    \item Using inappropriate (English) stopwords degrades performance
    \item The resource enables significant feature reduction without information loss
\end{enumerate}

Error analysis revealed that remaining errors often involve:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Dialectal variation in word usage
    \item Code-switching with French or English
    \item Orthographic inconsistencies
\end{itemize}

These point to areas for future refinement.

\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}

\subsection{Implications for Low-Resource NLP}

This work demonstrates that even basic linguistic resources can have substantial impact on NLP performance for low-resource languages. The methodology we employed---combining corpus analysis with expert validation---is replicable for other African languages, many of which lack even stopword lists.

\subsection{Dialectal Variation}

Our focus on Adamawa Fulfulde reflects the need for variant-specific resources. However, significant overlap exists across Fulfulde varieties. Future work could:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Extend the list to cover Maasina, Pulaar, and other major dialects
    \item Create a unified resource with dialect-specific annotations
    \item Investigate cross-dialectal transfer in NLP tasks
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Integration with Broader NLP Pipelines}

Stopword lists are most effective as part of comprehensive preprocessing pipelines. Priority areas for Fulfulde NLP development include:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Tokenization and sentence segmentation
    \item Lemmatization and stemming
    \item Part-of-speech tagging
    \item Named entity recognition
\end{itemize}

Our stopword list provides a foundation for these developments.

\subsection{Limitations}

Several limitations should be noted:
\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep]
    \item \textbf{Corpus size}: 450K tokens is modest; larger corpora could reveal additional patterns
    \item \textbf{Domain coverage}: Certain domains (technical, scientific) are underrepresented
    \item \textbf{Orthographic variation}: Multiple spelling conventions exist for Fulfulde
    \item \textbf{Evaluation dataset size}: Larger benchmark datasets are needed
\end{enumerate}

\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

We have presented the first comprehensive stopword list for Fulfulde (Adamawa variant), a critically under-resourced African language. Our resource combines corpus-based frequency analysis with expert linguistic validation, resulting in a curated list of 182 stopwords. Released as an open-source Python library, this resource enables improved text classification, information retrieval, and other NLP tasks for Fulfulde.

Experimental evaluation demonstrates substantial performance gains: 12.3\% improvement in classification accuracy and consistent improvements across all information retrieval metrics. The resource also enables 43.7\% reduction in feature dimensionality, improving computational efficiency.

This work contributes to the growing ecosystem of NLP tools for African languages and provides a replicable methodology for developing similar resources. We hope it will enable and inspire further research on Fulfulde and related low-resource languages.

Future work will focus on:
\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item Extending coverage to other Fulfulde variants
    \item Developing complementary resources (lemmatizers, POS taggers)
    \item Creating larger benchmark datasets
    \item Investigating the impact on additional NLP tasks
\end{itemize}

All resources are freely available to support continued research and development.
