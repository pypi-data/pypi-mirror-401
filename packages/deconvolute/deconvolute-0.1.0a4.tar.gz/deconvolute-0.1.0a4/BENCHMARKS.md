# Performance Benchmarks and Efficacy Validation

## Purpose
The efficacy of RAG security controls is non-deterministic and highly dependent on the underlying Large Language Model (LLM) used in the pipeline. While the Deconvolute SDK ensures the *mechanism* of defense (e.g. proper token injection, correct XML encapsulation), the *robustness* of these defenses against adversarial attacks varies by model.

This document serves as the central registry for empirical validation results.

## Methodology
Validation is conducted using an adversarial red-teaming framework.

## Current Status

*Note: Absence of a benchmark for a specific model does not imply incompatibility, but rather a lack of empirical security guarantees.*
