    Base result model for all security detection operations.

        threat_detected (bool): True if a threat or security violation was detected.

        timestamp (datetime): The UTC timestamp when the check was performed.

            (e.g. 'Canary', 'YaraScanner').
        metadata (dict[str, Any]): A dictionary for arbitrary contextual data.
            Used for telemetry (e.g. latency, model versions, specific rule IDs).
