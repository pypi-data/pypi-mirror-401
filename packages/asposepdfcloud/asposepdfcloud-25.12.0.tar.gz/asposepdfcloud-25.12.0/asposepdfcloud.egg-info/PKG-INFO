You can use it with any language or platform that supports REST, be it the web, desktop, mobile, or the cloud. The API integrates with other cloud services to provide you the flexibility you require for processing documents. It is suitable for the most types of businesses, documents, or content.

## Getting Started with Aspose.Pdf Cloud SDK for Python

Firstly, create an account at [Aspose for Cloud](https://dashboard.aspose.cloud/#/apps) to get your application information and free quota to use the API.
Now execute from the command line command to fetch the SDK. 
```sh
pip install asposepdfcloud
```

If the python package is hosted on Github, you can install directly from Github

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python.git
```


Then import the package:
```python
import asposepdfcloud
```

### Setuptools
Install via [Setuptools](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools).

```sh
python setup.py install --user
```
(or `sudo python setup.py install` to install the package for all users)

Then import the package:
```python
import asposepdfcloud
```

## Get PDF Page Annotations in Python
```python
	# Get your ClientId and ClientSecret from https://dashboard.aspose.cloud (free registration required).
	pdf_api_client = asposepdfcloud.ApiClient('MY_CLIENT_SECRET', 'MY_CLIENT_ID')
	pdf_api = asposepdfcloud.PdfApi(pdf_api_client)
	file_name = 'sample.pdf'
	page_number = 1
	response = pdf_api.get_page_annotations(file_name, page_number, folder=temp_folder)
```

## SelfHost Aspose.PDF Cloud
Create **ApiClient** object without **client_secret** and **client_id** parameters, but with **host** parameter set to *url of [SelfHost Aspose.PDF Cloud](https://hub.docker.com/r/aspose/pdf-cloud)* and **self_host** parameter set to *True*:
```python
	pdf_api_client = asposepdfcloud.ApiClient('', '', 'MY_SELFHOST_URL', True)
```

## Use cases

The Aspose.PDF Cloud SDK includes a set of ready-to-run use cases in the "[Uses-Cases](https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python/tree/master/Uses-Cases)" directory. These examples illustrate common operations such as managing annotations, attachments, text, and more.

1. Add your API credentials **client_id** and **client_secret** into [settings/credentials.json](https://github.com/aspose-pdf-cloud/aspose-pdf-cloud-python/tree/master/settings/credentials.json):

```
{
  "client_secret": "YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET",
  "client_id": "YOUR_CLIENT_ID"
}
```
2. Launch use case:
```
python Uses-Cases/Annotations/annotations_launch.py
```

## Unit Tests
