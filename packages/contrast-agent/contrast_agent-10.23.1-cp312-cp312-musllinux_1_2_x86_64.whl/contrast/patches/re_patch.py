        Hook for re.sub and re.subn used for propagation in assess

        The following explains why we can't simply patch these methods using
        policy.

        It is possible for the repl argument to be a callable. In this case, the
        callable is passed a Match object, and it returns the string to be used for
        the replacement. In order to correctly propagate the substitution
        operation, we need to keep track of the results of calling the replacement
        function.

        It might seem like we should just call the replacement function again
        during our propagation action. But this is not practicable for several
        reasons:

          1. We're in scope at the time, so any propagation that needs to occur
             within the replacement callable itself will be missed.
          2. Related to above, but methods of Match do not return the same object
             even when called multiple times with the same arguments, so we would
             not be tracking the strings that actually get used in the substitution
             result.
          3. There's no guarantee that the replacement function does not cause any
             side effects or rely on any state in application code. We definitely
             don't want to mess around with this.

        The solution is to wrap the replacement callable with our own function that
        records the results of each call. We then pass our wrapped callable to the
        original function, and we pass the accumulated results to the propagator.
        This has the additional benefit of allowing us to wrap the match object
        that is passed to the repl function with our proxied object so that we
        propagate any calls that are made within this function if necessary.
