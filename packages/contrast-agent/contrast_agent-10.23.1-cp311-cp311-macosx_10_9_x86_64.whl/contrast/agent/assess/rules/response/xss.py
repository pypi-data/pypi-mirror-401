    The xss rule is applied to the response body in order to determine whether it
    contains untrusted data. We rely on propagation through any template rendering
    and through the framework. The expectation is that untrusted data from
    a request will propagate successfully all the way to the response body, which
    we are able to see here.

    Each child middleware class must implement specific logic for the trigger node
    since the reporting will differ between frameworks.
