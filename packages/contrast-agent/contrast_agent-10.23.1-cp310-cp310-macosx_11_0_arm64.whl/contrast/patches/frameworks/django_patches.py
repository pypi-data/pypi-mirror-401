        This patch implements a more optimized "deadzoned" original mark_safe call.

        We are deadzoning calling the original mark_safe because it may call SafeText,
        a class that inherits from str and that ends up propagating excessively.

        Because mark_safe is called many times when Django renders a template,
        excessive propagation is incredibly costly. So instead, we do the same work as
        the KEEP propagator would, but with a deadzoned call to the original function.
