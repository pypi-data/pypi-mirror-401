    Base class for children that provide the Singleton pattern

    Singletons are classes that guarantee that only a single instance can ever
    be created. Any time a "new" instance of the class is instantiated, it
    actually refers to the same underlying object. This is useful for providing
    a container for global state.

    This implementation was taken from the Python documentation (admittedly,
    from a very old version):
