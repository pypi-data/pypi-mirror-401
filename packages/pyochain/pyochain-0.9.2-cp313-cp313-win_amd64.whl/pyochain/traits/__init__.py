"""Public mixins traits for internal pyochain types, and custom user implementations.

Since `Pipeable` and `Checkable` depend only on Self for arguments, returns types and internal logic, they can be safely added to any already existing class to provide additional functionality.

`PyoIterable` is a more specific trait, equivalent to subclassing `abc.Iterable`, but with additional methods and requirements specific to pyochain.
