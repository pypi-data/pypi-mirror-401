# RepoScope GitHub Action

The **RepoScope GitHub Action** runs RepoScope as part of a GitHub workflow and uploads
the generated `.reposcope/` reports as workflow artifacts.

PR commenting is **explicitly opt-in**.

## What this action does

- Runs RepoScope against the checked-out repository
- Generates architecture, risk, onboarding, and summary reports
- Uploads `.reposcope/` as workflow artifacts
- Optionally posts a **concise, trust-safe PR comment** with top risks
