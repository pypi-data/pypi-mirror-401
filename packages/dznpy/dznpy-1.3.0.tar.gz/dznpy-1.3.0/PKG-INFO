# dznpy

Python modules to support in developing C++ software with [Dezyne](https://dezyne.org/). Mainly, parse Dezyne files into
an Abstract Syntax Tree from which the developer/user of dznpy can 'walk' through with Python helpers.

## Installation

Like any Python package on PyPi:

    pip install dznpy

## Usage

For examples and documentation visit the homepage at https://github.com/mikeftrict/dznpy where for instance it is
demonstrated how to generate custom C++ thread-safe shell code (aka Advanced Shell as included). Another example
shows the C++17 generation of a GoogleMock from  a Dezyne interface.
