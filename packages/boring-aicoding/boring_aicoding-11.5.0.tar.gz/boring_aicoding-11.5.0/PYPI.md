**Autonomous AI Agent Loop with VibeCoder Experience**

---

## ✨ The Vibe Coder Experience

**No Code Needed.** Just describe the vibe.

Boring-Gemini features a **Universal Natural Language Router**. You don't need to remember 98+ complex tools. Just say what you want:

> "Search for authentication logic"  
> "Review my code for security issues"  
> "幫我寫測試" (Help me write tests)

---

## 🚀 Quick Start (One-Click)

### 🪄 Zero-Config Wizard 
Boring features a smart setup wizard that automatically bridges your IDE (Cursor, VS Code, Claude Desktop) with the Gemini agent.

```bash
pip install "boring-aicoding[all]"
boring wizard
```

### 💎 Smithery Integration
One-click install for Cursor/Claude Desktop.

```bash
npx -y @smithery/cli@latest install boring/boring --client cursor
```

## 🧐 Cognitive Evolution (Pillar V)

V11.2.2 transforms Boring from a simple loop into a **Self-Improving Intelligence System**:

- **🧘‍♀️ Deep & Critical Thinking**: Decomposes complex problems using multi-layered reasoning states (System 2).
- **⚡ Brain Reflex (Active Recall)**: Instantly recalls past debug patterns. No more "searching"—it remembers how you fixed that `AttributeError` last time.
- **🏆 Skill Compilation**: High-frequency successful patterns are distilled into **Strategic Skills**, making your local agent uniquely expert in your stack.
- **🛠️ Live Tool Synthesis**: The agent can now **generate its own tools** in Python to solve hyper-specific problems on-the-fly.
- **🌐 Knowledge Swarm**: Sync learned patterns across your team via Git-based synchronization.

## ⚡ Core Capabilities

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 🧠 **Autonomous Loop** | Runs continuously: thinking → coding → testing → fixing. |
| 🕵️ **Context Optimization** | 80% token savings via smart chunking and specificity ranking. |
| 🛡️ **Shadow Mode** | Safe execution sandbox catches destructive operations before they happen. |
| 🧩 **Natural Language** | Universal Router: "幫我寫測試" or "Fix auth bugs" triggered instantly. |
| 🧪 **Vibe Score** | Gamified health check: Lint, Security, and Docs tracked over time. |
