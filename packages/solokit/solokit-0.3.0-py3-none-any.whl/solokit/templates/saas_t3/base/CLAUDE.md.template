## Building From Scratch

This project uses minimal scaffolding. You'll create files from scratch:

1. **Read the PRD** at `docs/PRD.md`
2. **Understand the story** requirements and acceptance criteria
3. **Create necessary files** following ARCHITECTURE.md patterns
4. **Write tests** alongside implementation
5. **Run quality gates** before completing

### Quick Pattern Reference

**Adding a New Feature:**

1. Database: Add model to `prisma/schema.prisma`
2. Generate: Run `npx prisma generate && npx prisma migrate dev`
3. Router: Create `server/api/routers/[feature].ts`
4. Register: Add router to `server/api/root.ts`
5. Component: Create `components/[feature]/`
6. Page: Create `app/[feature]/page.tsx`
7. Tests: Create tests in `__tests__/` directories

---

## Stack Architecture Rules

### Critical Rules

1. **Always use tRPC for API communication**
   - Never use raw `fetch()` for internal API calls
   - Never create REST endpoints in `/api/` routes
   - All server communication goes through tRPC routers

2. **Database access via Prisma**
   - Import `db` from `@/server/db` for all database operations
   - Never import Prisma client directly
   - Never access `db` from client components (server-only)

3. **Environment variables**
   - All env vars must be validated through `lib/env.ts`
   - Use `env.VARIABLE_NAME` not `process.env.VARIABLE_NAME`
   - Add new variables to the env schema before using

4. **Authentication**
   - Use NextAuth.js helpers from `@/server/auth`
   - Protect tRPC procedures with `protectedProcedure`

### File Organization

| New Code Type    | Location                 |
| ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| tRPC routers     | `server/api/routers/`    |
| React components | `components/`            |
| Pages            | `app/`                   |
| Database schema  | `prisma/schema.prisma`   |
| Server utilities | `server/`                |
| Client utilities | `lib/`                   |

### Code Patterns

**Creating a tRPC Router:**

```typescript
// server/api/routers/posts.ts
import { createTRPCRouter, publicProcedure, protectedProcedure } from "@/server/api/trpc";
import { z } from "zod";

export const postsRouter = createTRPCRouter({
  getAll: publicProcedure.query(async ({ ctx }) => {
    return ctx.db.post.findMany();
  }),

  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(z.object({ title: z.string().min(1), content: z.string().optional() }))
    .mutation(async ({ ctx, input }) => {
      return ctx.db.post.create({ data: input });
    }),
});
```

**Using tRPC in Components:**

```typescript
"use client";
import { api } from "@/lib/api";

export function PostsList() {
  const { data, isLoading } = api.posts.getAll.useQuery();
  const createMutation = api.posts.create.useMutation();
  // ...
}
```

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

- Creating `/api/` REST routes instead of tRPC routers
- Importing `db` in client components
- Using `process.env` directly without env validation
- Skipping Zod validation on tRPC inputs
- Not adding new routers to the root router in `server/api/root.ts`

## Solokit Usage Guide

This project uses Solokit for Session-Driven Development. Follow these guidelines for consistent and effective usage.

### Understanding Solokit Commands

Solokit commands are available as **slash commands** in Claude Code (e.g., `/start`, `/end`, `/work-new`) or via the `sk` CLI in terminal. **Slash commands are preferred** as they provide interactive prompts.

For CLI usage with specific arguments, use `--help` to discover options:

```bash
sk <command> --help
```

### Work Item Management

#### Creating Work Items

**When asked to create a work item, ALWAYS use the CLI:**

```bash
# First, check available options
sk work-new --help

# Create with required fields
sk work-new --type feature --title "Add user authentication" --priority high

# With dependencies
sk work-new --type feature --title "Add OAuth" --priority high --dependencies feat_user_auth

# Mark as urgent
sk work-new --type bug --title "Fix critical login error" --priority critical --urgent
```

**NEVER create work items by directly editing `work_items.json`.**

**Valid Types**: feature, bug, refactor, security, integration_test, deployment
**Valid Priorities**: critical, high, medium, low

#### Listing Work Items

```bash
# List all work items
sk work-list

# Filter by status
sk work-list --status not_started
sk work-list --status in_progress

# Filter by type
sk work-list --type bug

# Filter by milestone
sk work-list --milestone "v1.0"
```

#### Viewing Work Item Details

```bash
sk work-show <work_item_id>
```

#### Updating Work Items

```bash
# Check available update options
sk work-update --help

# Update status
sk work-update feat_001 --status in_progress

# Update priority
sk work-update feat_001 --priority critical

# Add dependency
sk work-update feat_001 --add-dependency feat_002

# Mark as urgent
sk work-update feat_001 --set-urgent
```

#### Deleting Work Items

```bash
sk work-delete <work_item_id>
```

### Spec File Guidelines

**CRITICAL: When creating work items, spec files are automatically created from templates.**

#### Spec File Location

- Spec files are stored in `.session/specs/`
- Each work item gets a spec file: `.session/specs/{work_item_id}.md`

#### When to Update Spec Files

1. **After creating a work item** - Fill in the template placeholders
2. **Before starting work** - Ensure spec is complete
3. **During implementation** - Update with any changes or discoveries

#### Spec File Best Practices

1. **Always use the template structure**
   - Don't create spec files from scratch
   - Use the existing template in `.session/specs/`
   - Fill in ALL sections, don't leave placeholders

2. **Be thorough and consistent**
   - If creating multiple work items, give EQUAL attention to each spec file
   - Don't write detailed specs for the first few and brief specs for the rest
   - Each spec file should have the same level of detail

3. **Include acceptance criteria**
   - Every spec must have clear, testable acceptance criteria
   - These will be used during `/validate` and `/end`

4. **Link related work items**
   - Reference dependencies in the spec
   - Note any blocking or blocked-by relationships

#### Spec File Template Structure

```markdown
# Work Item: {title}

## Overview

[Clear description of what this work item accomplishes]

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Criterion 1
- [ ] Criterion 2
- [ ] Criterion 3

## Technical Approach

[How will this be implemented?]

## Dependencies

[List any work items this depends on]

## Testing Requirements

[What tests need to be written?]

## Notes

[Any additional context]
```

### Session Workflow

#### Starting a Session

Use `/start` to begin a session:

```bash
/start                    # Interactive - select from available work items
/start <work_item_id>     # Start specific work item
```

The start command:

- Updates work item status to `in_progress`
- Generates a session briefing in `.session/briefings/`
- Provides context about the work item and dependencies

#### Checking Session Status

Use `/status` to check current session:

```bash
/status
```

Shows:

- Current work item
- Session duration
- Quality gate status
- Pending tasks

#### Validating Without Ending

Use `/validate` to check quality gates:

```bash
/validate
```

Runs quality gates without ending the session:

- Test coverage check
- Linting
- Type checking
- Spec completion status

Use this frequently during development to catch issues early.

#### Ending a Session

Use `/end` to complete a session:

```bash
/end
```

The end command:

- Runs all quality gate validations
- Prompts for session summary
- Updates work item status if complete
- Generates session history in `.session/history/`
- Prompts for learning capture

**IMPORTANT**: Always end sessions properly. Don't abandon sessions.

### Learning Capture

#### When to Capture Learnings

Capture learnings when you:

- Solve a tricky problem
- Discover a better pattern
- Find an important gotcha
- Learn something about the codebase

#### How to Capture Learnings

**Method 1: During Session End (Preferred)**
When running `/end`, you'll be prompted to capture learnings. This is the preferred method as it links learnings to the session context.

**Method 2: Explicit Command**

```bash
/learn
```

This will prompt for:

- Learning title
- Description
- Category
- Tags

#### Learning Storage

- Learnings are stored in `.session/tracking/learnings.json`
- They are indexed and searchable
- They persist across sessions

#### Searching Learnings

```bash
/learn-search "authentication"
```

#### Viewing Learnings

```bash
/learn-show                           # Show all learnings
/learn-show --category debugging      # Filter by category
/learn-show --tag authentication      # Filter by tag
```

**IMPORTANT**:

- Always capture learnings through Solokit commands, not by editing JSON directly
- Don't put learnings in commit messages - use the learning system
- Learnings should be reusable knowledge, not task-specific notes

### Dependency Graph

Visualize work item dependencies:

```bash
/work-graph                       # Generate dependency graph
/work-graph --focus feat_001      # Focus on specific work item
/work-graph --critical-path       # Show critical path
/work-graph --bottlenecks         # Show bottlenecks
```

---

## Claude Behavior Guidelines

### Be Thorough

1. **Complete all tasks fully**
   - Don't rush through multiple items
   - Give equal attention to each task
   - If creating 5 work items, each spec file should be equally detailed

2. **Don't make assumptions**
   - Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
   - Confirm understanding before making significant changes
   - When in doubt, ask rather than guess

3. **Follow established patterns**
   - Check existing code for patterns before writing new code
   - Maintain consistency with the codebase style
   - Reference ARCHITECTURE.md for stack-specific patterns

4. **Validate your work**
   - Run `/validate` after making changes
   - Ensure tests pass before considering work complete
   - Check that linting and type checking pass

### Ask Clarifying Questions When

- Requirements are vague or could be interpreted multiple ways
- You're unsure which of several approaches to take
- The task might affect other parts of the codebase
- You need to make architectural decisions
- The user's request conflicts with existing patterns

### Writing PRDs

When asked to create or write a PRD:

1. **Always read `.session/guides/PRD_WRITING_GUIDE.md` first** - This guide is mandatory
2. Follow the structure and best practices defined there
3. Use vertical slices, not horizontal layers (see guide for details)
4. Include all required sections: technical constraints, acceptance criteria, error cases
5. Reference `.session/guides/STACK_GUIDE.md` for stack-specific considerations
6. Save the PRD at `docs/PRD.md`

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT write PRDs from memory or general knowledge. The PRD_WRITING_GUIDE.md contains Solokit-specific patterns that ensure PRDs translate correctly into work items.

### Reference Documentation

- **ARCHITECTURE.md** - For stack-specific patterns, conventions, and code examples
- **README.md** - For project-specific configuration and getting started
- **.session/specs/** - For work item requirements and acceptance criteria
- **.session/guides/PRD_WRITING_GUIDE.md** - **MUST follow when writing PRDs**
- **.session/guides/STACK_GUIDE.md** - For understanding stack choice and capabilities
- **sk <command> --help** - For Solokit command options

## What NOT to Do

### Never Do These

1. **Don't edit tracking files directly**
   - NEVER edit `.session/tracking/work_items.json` manually
   - NEVER edit `.session/tracking/learnings.json` manually
   - Always use `sk` commands to modify these files

2. **Don't skip the spec file template**
   - NEVER create spec files from scratch
   - ALWAYS use the template structure in `.session/specs/`
   - ALWAYS fill in all sections of the template

3. **Don't be inconsistent with multiple items**
   - If creating multiple work items, don't write detailed specs for the first few and brief specs for the rest
   - Each item deserves equal attention and thoroughness

4. **Don't put learnings in wrong places**
   - NEVER add learnings to commit messages
   - NEVER create random learning files outside the system
   - ALWAYS use `/learn` or capture during `/end`

5. **Don't ignore the architecture**
   - NEVER violate stack-specific rules (see Stack Architecture Rules above)
   - NEVER use patterns that contradict ARCHITECTURE.md
   - NEVER skip validation steps

6. **Don't guess command options**
   - NEVER assume you know all options for an `sk` command
   - ALWAYS run `sk <command> --help` first if unsure
   - NEVER pass invalid arguments to commands

7. **Don't abandon sessions**
   - NEVER leave a session without running `/end`
   - NEVER start a new session without ending the current one
   - ALWAYS complete the session workflow properly

8. **Don't skip quality gates**
   - NEVER commit code that fails linting
   - NEVER commit code that fails type checking
   - NEVER commit code without running tests
   - NEVER bypass pre-commit hooks with `--no-verify`

### Stack-Specific Anti-Patterns

#### saas_t3

- DON'T create REST API routes in `/api/` - use tRPC routers
- DON'T import `db` in client components
- DON'T use `process.env` directly - use the env validation

## Quality Requirements

**Quality Tier**: {tier_name}
**Test Coverage Target**: {coverage_target}%

### Required Quality Gates

All code changes must pass these quality gates before completion:

#### All Tiers

- [ ] All tests pass
- [ ] Code is formatted (run formatter before commit)
- [ ] No linting errors
- [ ] Type checking passes
- [ ] Test coverage meets {coverage_target}% target

#### Additional Requirements by Tier

{tier_specific_requirements}

### Running Quality Checks

```bash
# Run all quality validations
/validate

# Manual checks for {template_id}:
npm test                 # Run tests
npm run test:coverage    # Check coverage
npm run lint             # Run linting
npm run type-check       # Run type checking
```

### Pre-Commit Hooks

This project has pre-commit hooks installed. They run automatically on `git commit`.

If hooks fail:

1. Fix the issues reported
2. Stage the fixes: `git add .`
3. Commit again

To bypass hooks (NOT RECOMMENDED):

```bash
git commit --no-verify
```
