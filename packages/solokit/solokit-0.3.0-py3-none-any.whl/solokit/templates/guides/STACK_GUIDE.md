# Solokit Stack Selection Guide

This guide helps you choose the right technology stack for your project. Each stack is optimized for specific use cases and enforces architectural patterns that work well for those scenarios.

---

## Quick Decision Tree

```
What are you building?

├── A SaaS product with user accounts and complex data?
│   └── Do you want maximum TypeScript type safety?
│       ├── Yes → saas_t3 (T3 Stack)
│       └── No, I prefer flexibility → fullstack_nextjs
│
├── An ML/AI backend or Python-heavy API?
│   └── ml_ai_fastapi
│
├── An admin dashboard or internal CRUD tool?
│   └── dashboard_refine
│
└── A general web application (marketing, content, e-commerce)?
    └── Do you need complex client-side interactivity?
        ├── Yes → saas_t3 or fullstack_nextjs
        └── No, mostly server-rendered → fullstack_nextjs
```

## Detailed Stack Profiles

### 1. SaaS T3 Stack (`saas_t3`)

**Technology Versions:**
- Next.js 16.0.7 + React 19.2.1
- tRPC 11.7.1
- Prisma 6.19.0
- TypeScript 5.9.3
- Tailwind CSS 4.1.17

**Best For:**
- SaaS products with user authentication
- Applications requiring end-to-end type safety
- Teams that are TypeScript-focused
- Internal tools where you control all clients
- Rapid development with minimal API boilerplate

**Not Ideal For:**
- APIs consumed by third-party clients (mobile apps, external services)
- Polyglot backends (Python ML services, Go microservices)
- Teams unfamiliar with TypeScript
- Simple static websites

**Key Architectural Patterns:**

1. **tRPC for All Internal APIs**
   - No REST endpoints for internal data fetching
   - Type safety flows from database → API → UI automatically
   - Queries and mutations are type-checked at compile time

2. **Server/Client Separation**
   - Database access only in `server/` directory
   - Clear boundaries prevent accidental client-side DB imports

3. **Environment Validation**
   - All environment variables validated with Zod at startup
   - Fail fast if configuration is missing

**File Organization (target structure you will build):**

Note: The template provides minimal scaffolding. The structure below shows what your project will look like as you build features.

```
server/
├── api/
│   ├── trpc.ts       # tRPC initialization (provided)
│   ├── root.ts       # Router composition (provided, add routers)
│   └── routers/      # CREATE: Feature routers
└── db.ts             # Prisma client (provided)

lib/
├── api.tsx           # tRPC React provider (provided)
└── env.ts            # Environment validation (provided)

app/                  # CREATE: Next.js pages
components/           # CREATE: React components
prisma/
└── schema.prisma     # Database schema (provided, add models)
```

**What This Stack Enforces:**
- All API communication through tRPC (not REST)
- TypeScript strict mode
- Prisma for database access
- Server components for data fetching

---

### 2. ML/AI FastAPI (`ml_ai_fastapi`)

**Technology Versions:**
- FastAPI 0.121.3
- Python 3.11+
- SQLModel 0.0.25 + SQLAlchemy 2.0.37

- Projects requiring tight frontend integration

**Key Architectural Patterns:**

1. **Async-First Design**
   - All route handlers are async
   - Non-blocking I/O for database and external calls
   - Efficient handling of concurrent requests

2. **Service Layer Pattern**
   - Routes → Services → Database
   - Business logic isolated in services
   - Easy to test with dependency injection

3. **Dependency Injection**
   - Database sessions via `Depends(get_db)`
   - Clean separation of concerns
   - Testable by overriding dependencies

4. **Schema Separation**
   - Database models (SQLModel) separate from API schemas (Pydantic)
   - Clear input/output contracts

**File Organization (target structure you will build):**

Note: The template provides minimal scaffolding. The structure below shows what your project will look like as you build features.

```
src/
├── api/
│   ├── dependencies.py   # Database dependencies (provided)
│   └── routes/           # CREATE: API endpoints
├── models/               # CREATE: SQLModel database models
├── services/             # CREATE: Business logic
└── core/
    ├── config.py         # Pydantic Settings (provided)
    └── database.py       # Engine and session (provided)

alembic/
├── env.py                # Alembic config (provided)

1. **Refine Data Provider Pattern**
   - All CRUD operations through Refine hooks
   - Backend-agnostic (REST, GraphQL, Supabase all supported)
   - Built-in pagination, filtering, sorting

2. **Resource-Based Architecture**
   - URL structure matches resources (`/users`, `/products`)
   - Automatic routing based on resource definitions
   - Consistent patterns across all entities

3. **Route Groups**
   - Dashboard pages in `(dashboard)` group
   - Shared layouts without URL prefix
   - Clear separation from public pages

**File Organization (target structure you will build):**

Note: The template provides minimal scaffolding. The structure below shows what your project will look like as you build features.

```
app/
├── (dashboard)/          # Route group (provided)
│   ├── layout.tsx        # Dashboard layout (provided)
│   └── [resource]/       # CREATE: Resource pages
│       ├── page.tsx      # CREATE: List view
│       ├── create/       # CREATE: Create view
│       ├── edit/         # CREATE: Edit view
│       └── show/         # CREATE: Detail view

components/
├── layout/               # Header, sidebar (provided)
├── forms/                # CREATE: Form components

└── validations.ts        # CREATE: Zod schemas
```

**What This Stack Enforces:**
- Refine hooks for all CRUD operations (useList, useTable, useForm, useShow)
- shadcn/ui component library
- Data provider pattern (must implement for production)
- Resource-based URL structure

**Important Note:**
You must implement a data provider to connect to your backend. Refine supports:

2. **Server Actions for Mutations**
   - Prefer Server Actions over API routes
   - Progressive enhancement support
   - Simpler mental model

3. **Minimal Abstraction**
   - No tRPC or complex API layer
   - Direct Prisma queries in server code
   - API routes only for webhooks and external APIs

**File Organization (target structure you will build):**

Note: The template provides minimal scaffolding. The structure below shows what your project will look like as you build features.

```
app/
├── api/              # API routes (health check provided)
├── actions/          # CREATE: Server Actions
