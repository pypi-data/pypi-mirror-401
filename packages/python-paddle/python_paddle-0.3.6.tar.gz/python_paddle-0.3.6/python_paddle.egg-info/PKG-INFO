# Unofficial Paddle Billing Python SDK

A small Paddle Billing SDK. It uses pydantic for schemas derived from the Paddle Billing OpenAPI
file.

## Installation

To install the package, install it from pypi:

```sh
uv add python-paddle
# or
pip install python-paddle
```

Or your favorite package manager.

## Usage

Currently, the SDK does not provide functions to call the API for all resources. It does provide
two things:

1. API schemas as Pydantic models
2. Webhook validation
3. Operations on customers
4. Operations on transactions
5. Operations on saved payment methods
6. Operations on subscriptions
7. Operations on addresses
8. Operations on businesses

### Calling the API

To call the API, you need to initialize a client:

```py
from paddle import Paddle

client = Paddle(token="...")
```

In case you're using the sandbox environment, pass `production = False` as an argument when
initializing the `Paddle` class.

```py
client = Paddle(token="...", production=False)
```

Once you have the client, you can call any methods on it asynchronously. For example:

```py
transaction = await client.get_transaction(transaction_id)
```

### Schemas

The schemas can be found under `paddle.schemas`, like `paddle.schemas.Transaction`.

### Webhooks

Webhooks can be validated using `paddle.webhooks.verify`. For example:

```py
from paddle import webhooks

webhooks.verify(
    secret="YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET",
    signature="YOUR_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE",  # Extract this value from the `Paddle-Signature` in the webhook request
    body="THE_REQUEST_BODY",
)
```

It'll raise a `paddle.webhooks.exceptions.ValidationError` if the webhook could not be verified,
otherwise it'll return `True`.

To instead get a `bool` returned from the function, without an error raised on failure, pass the
`error=False` argument.

```py
from paddle import webhooks

is_valid = webhooks.verify(
    secret="YOUR_WEBHOOK_SECRET",
    signature="YOUR_WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE",  # Extract this value from the `Paddle-Signature` in the webhook request
    body="THE_REQUEST_BODY",
    error=False,
)

if is_valid:
    print("Great!")

else:
    print("Damn")
```

### Exceptions

All exceptions raised by this library inherit from `paddle.exceptions.PaddleException`.
