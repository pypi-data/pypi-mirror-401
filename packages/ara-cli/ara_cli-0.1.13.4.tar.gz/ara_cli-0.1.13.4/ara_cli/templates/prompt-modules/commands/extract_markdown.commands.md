# general markdown file generation and file extract instructions
* return full copy pastable file content using a markdown code block with 5-backticks:
`````
# [ ] extract
# filename: <filepath>/<filename>.md
{markdown formatted text}
`````
* The extract and filename statements are only allowed once per markdown code block
* The first character of the first line inside your code block must be '#' and the first character of the second line inside your code block must be '#'
* replace the '# [ ] extract' statement of the template with '# [x] extract' in your response
* in case of files get deprecated give me a list of files that can be safely deleted
