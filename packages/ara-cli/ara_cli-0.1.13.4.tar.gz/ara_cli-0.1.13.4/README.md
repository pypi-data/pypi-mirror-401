# ara-cli

**ara-cli** is a powerful, open source command-line tool for managing, structuring and automating software development artifacts in line with Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) and AI-assisted processes. With an intuitive interface and platform-independent implementation in Python, ara-cli enables teams to structure business goals, capabilities, features, user stories, and tasks, and to leverage integrated AI/chat capabilities for requirements engineering, documentation, and process automation.

---

## Features

- **Comprehensive Artefact Management:**  
  Create, edit, rename, delete, and list all core artefacts of the software development lifecycle: businessgoals, vision, capabilities, keyfeatures, features, epics, userstories, examples, and tasks.

- **Structured Traceability:**  
  Organize and link artefacts for full traceability from business goals to implementation tasks. Effortlessly navigate artefact hierarchies and dependencies.

- **Integrated AI and Chat:**  
  Interact with AI language models directly from your terminal. Use chat and prompt commands to assist with documentation, requirements refinement, and artefact management.

- **Prompt Templates:**  
  Fetch, use, and manage reusable prompt templates for consistent and efficient requirements and documentation workflows.

- **Artefact Status and User Management:**  
  Assign and query status and responsible users for artefacts to support project coordination and tracking.

- **Automated Quality Assurance:**  
  Scan artefact trees for inconsistencies and automatically correct issues using integrated LLM-powered autofix functionality.

- **Powerful Listing and Search:**  
  List artefacts and filter by type, tags, content, contributor relationships, file extensions, and more.

- **Open Source & Platform Independent:**  
  Implemented in Python and available on PyPI for easy installation and integration into any workflow.

## Use Cases

- **Requirements Engineering:**  
  Capture and structure business requirements and user stories with clear traceability.

- **Agile Development:**  
  Manage and automate backlog refinement, sprint planning, and task tracking.

- **AI-Enhanced Productivity:**  
  Use chat and prompt features to accelerate documentation, code review, and knowledge management.

- **Quality Management:**  
  Ensure artefact consistency and high documentation quality via automated scans and fixes.

## Agent Commands

`ara-cli` includes powerful agent-based capabilities that can be accessed through the interactive chat. These agents can perform complex, multi-step tasks, such as conducting interviews or automating coding workflows.

To use the agent commands, first start an interactive chat session:

```bash
ara prompt chat <artefact_classifier> <artefact_name>
```

Once inside the chat, you can use the following commands to manage agents:

| Command          | Shortcut | Description                                       |
| ---------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| `AGENT_RUN`      | `a`      | Run an agent by name.                             |
| `AGENT_STOP`     | `as`     | Stop the currently running agent.                 |
| `AGENT_CONTINUE` | `ac`     | Continue the agent's operation without new input. |
| `AGENT_STATUS`   | `astat`  | Show the status of the current agent.             |
| `exit`           |          | Exit from agent interfacto back to chat.          |

**Example:**

```bash
ara> a interview_agent
```

**Important:** The agent functionality requires the `ara-agents` package to be installed separately. If you do not have `ara-agents` installed, please contact the Talsen Team for assistance.

## Artefact Structure

ara-cli organizes your project artefacts in a clear directory structure:

```
./ara/
   ├── businessgoals/
   ├── vision/
   ├── capabilities/
   ├── keyfeatures/
   ├── features/
   ├── epics/
   ├── userstories/
   ├── examples/
   ├── tasks/
```

---

## Example Workflows

- **Create a new feature and link it to a user story:**

```bash
ara create feature payment contributes-to userstory checkout
```

- **Read an artefact's content and its full parent chain:**

```bash
ara read task implement_api --branch
```

- **List tasks containing specific content:**

```bash
ara list --include-extension .task --include-content "API integration"
```

- **Automate prompt-based LLM interaction for a task:**

```bash
ara prompt send task implement_api
ara prompt extract task implement_api
```
