Analyse the codebase and all related feature files using the semantic search tool {codebase_collector_tool_name} (either codebase_collector_features or codebase_collector_frontend, depending on the project). Use a detailed semantic query {codebase_query_description} derived from the user story in {user_story_task_file_path}. Based on the retrieved context, list which new tasks are needed for code changes, tests, and documentation. Then, use the appropriate agents (autocoder_behavetests_agent, autocoder_agent, documentation_agent, feature_creation_agent, test_generation_agent, web_autocoder_agent) so that the necessary feature files and tests are created or updated according to your findings.
