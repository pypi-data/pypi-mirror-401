# general file generation and file extract instructions
* return only full copy pastable file content using this markdown codeblock format with 5 backticks:
`````
# [ ] extract
# filename: <absolute filepath>/<filename>.<file_extension>
{valid file content depending on the given file_extension}
`````

* The extract and filename statements are only allowed once per markdown code block
* The first character of the first line inside your code block must be '#' and the first character of the second line inside your code block must be '#'
* replace the '# [ ] extract' statement of the template with '# [x] extract' in your response
* in case of files get deprecated give me a list of files that can be safely deleted
