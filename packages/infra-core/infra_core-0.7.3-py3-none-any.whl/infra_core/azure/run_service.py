"""Shared run service primitives for Azure-backed HTTP handlers.

This module exposes the storage mixin used by the crawler and screenshot
services. The mixin centralises Azure Storage client wiring and manifest
generation so individual services can focus on their domain-specific
behaviour (resume handling, progress tracking, etc.).

Example:
    >>> from infra_core.azure.run_service import RunStorageMixin
    >>> settings, mode = AzureStorageSettings.from_env_with_prefix("CRAWLER")
    >>> client = AzureStorageClient.from_settings(settings, mode)
    >>> class DemoService(RunStorageMixin):
    ...     def describe(self, record) -> dict[str, object]:
    ...         return self.build_result_manifest(record)
    >>> service = DemoService(azure_client=client)
