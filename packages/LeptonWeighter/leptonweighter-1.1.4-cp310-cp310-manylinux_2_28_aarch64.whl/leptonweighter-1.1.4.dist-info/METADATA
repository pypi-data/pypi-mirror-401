          Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. <https://fsf.org/>
          Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
          of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
         
         
           This version of the GNU Lesser General Public License incorporates
         the terms and conditions of version 3 of the GNU General Public
         License, supplemented by the additional permissions listed below.
         
           0. Additional Definitions.
         
           As used herein, "this License" refers to version 3 of the GNU Lesser
         General Public License, and the "GNU GPL" refers to version 3 of the GNU
         General Public License.
         
           "The Library" refers to a covered work governed by this License,
         other than an Application or a Combined Work as defined below.
         
           An "Application" is any work that makes use of an interface provided
         by the Library, but which is not otherwise based on the Library.
         Defining a subclass of a class defined by the Library is deemed a mode
         of using an interface provided by the Library.
         
           A "Combined Work" is a work produced by combining or linking an
         Application with the Library.  The particular version of the Library
         with which the Combined Work was made is also called the "Linked
         Version".
         
           The "Minimal Corresponding Source" for a Combined Work means the
         Corresponding Source for the Combined Work, excluding any source code
         for portions of the Combined Work that, considered in isolation, are
         based on the Application, and not on the Linked Version.
         
           The "Corresponding Application Code" for a Combined Work means the
         object code and/or source code for the Application, including any data
         and utility programs needed for reproducing the Combined Work from the
         Application, but excluding the System Libraries of the Combined Work.
         
           1. Exception to Section 3 of the GNU GPL.
         
           You may convey a covered work under sections 3 and 4 of this License
         without being bound by section 3 of the GNU GPL.
         
           2. Conveying Modified Versions.
         
           If you modify a copy of the Library, and, in your modifications, a
         facility refers to a function or data to be supplied by an Application
         that uses the facility (other than as an argument passed when the
         facility is invoked), then you may convey a copy of the modified
         version:
         
            a) under this License, provided that you make a good faith effort to
            ensure that, in the event an Application does not supply the
            function or data, the facility still operates, and performs
            whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful, or
         
            b) under the GNU GPL, with none of the additional permissions of
            this License applicable to that copy.
         
           3. Object Code Incorporating Material from Library Header Files.
         
           The object code form of an Application may incorporate material from
         a header file that is part of the Library.  You may convey such object
         code under terms of your choice, provided that, if the incorporated
         material is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure
         layouts and accessors, or small macros, inline functions and templates
         (ten or fewer lines in length), you do both of the following:
         
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the object code that the
            Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
            covered by this License.
         
            b) Accompany the object code with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
            document.
         
           4. Combined Works.
         
           You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
         taken together, effectively do not restrict modification of the
         portions of the Library contained in the Combined Work and reverse
         engineering for debugging such modifications, if you also do each of
         the following:
         
            a) Give prominent notice with each copy of the Combined Work that
            the Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are
            covered by this License.
         
            b) Accompany the Combined Work with a copy of the GNU GPL and this license
            document.
         
            c) For a Combined Work that displays copyright notices during
            execution, include the copyright notice for the Library among
            these notices, as well as a reference directing the user to the
            copies of the GNU GPL and this license document.
         
            d) Do one of the following:
         
                0) Convey the Minimal Corresponding Source under the terms of this
                License, and the Corresponding Application Code in a form
                suitable for, and under terms that permit, the user to
                recombine or relink the Application with a modified version of
                the Linked Version to produce a modified Combined Work, in the
                manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL for conveying
                Corresponding Source.
         
                1) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
                Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (a) uses at run time
                a copy of the Library already present on the user's computer
                system, and (b) will operate properly with a modified version
                of the Library that is interface-compatible with the Linked
                Version.
         
            e) Provide Installation Information, but only if you would otherwise
            be required to provide such information under section 6 of the
            GNU GPL, and only to the extent that such information is
            necessary to install and execute a modified version of the
            Combined Work produced by recombining or relinking the
            Application with a modified version of the Linked Version. (If
            you use option 4d0, the Installation Information must accompany
            the Minimal Corresponding Source and Corresponding Application
            Code. If you use option 4d1, you must provide the Installation
            Information in the manner specified by section 6 of the GNU GPL
            for conveying Corresponding Source.)
         
           5. Combined Libraries.
         
           You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
         Library side by side in a single library together with other library
         facilities that are not Applications and are not covered by this
         License, and convey such a combined library under terms of your
         choice, if you do both of the following:
         
            a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based
            on the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities,
            conveyed under the terms of this License.
         
            b) Give prominent notice with the combined library that part of it
            is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
            accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
         
           6. Revised Versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License.
         
           The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
         of the GNU Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new
         versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may
         differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
         
           Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the
         Library as you received it specifies that a certain numbered version
         of the GNU Lesser General Public License "or any later version"
         applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and
         conditions either of that published version or of any later version
         published by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library as you
         received it does not specify a version number of the GNU Lesser
         General Public License, you may choose any version of the GNU Lesser
         General Public License ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
         
           If the Library as you received it specifies that a proxy can decide
         whether future versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License shall
         apply, that proxy's public statement of acceptance of any version is
         permanent authorization for you to choose that version for the
         Library.

Prerequisites
-------------

The following libraries are required:

* C++11 capable compiler
* GSL (>= 1.15): http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/
* HDF5 with C bindings: http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/
* Photospline (v2): https://github.com/icecube/photospline

Optional (recommended):

* SQuIDS (>= 1.2): https://github.com/jsalvado/SQuIDS/ - Required by nuSQuIDS
* nuSQuIDS (>= 1.0): https://github.com/arguelles/nuSQuIDS - Enables nuSQuIDS flux interfaces and tau decay corrections
* nuflux: https://github.com/icecube/nuflux - Enables nuflux interface (requires Boost headers)

For Python bindings, you also need:

* numpy: http://www.numpy.org/
* pybind11 (default) or Boost.Python (legacy)

Configuration
-------------

Use the provided configure script:

	./configure --help

Basic configuration:

	./configure --with-squids=/path/to/squids --with-nusquids=/path/to/nusquids

The configure script will automatically detect most dependencies via pkg-config. You can manually specify paths if needed:

	./configure --with-gsl=/path/to/gsl \
	            --with-hdf5=/path/to/hdf5 \
	            --with-squids=/path/to/squids \
	            --with-nusquids=/path/to/nusquids \
	            --with-photospline-config=/path/to/photospline-config

Building
--------

Once configuration is complete, compile the library:

	make

Compile example programs:

	make examples

The examples can be found in `resources/example/`.

Installing
----------

Install the library (default location: `/usr/local`):

	make install

To change the installation prefix:

	./configure --prefix=$HOME/local

Python Bindings
---------------

LeptonWeighter supports two Python binding backends:

### pybind11 (default, recommended)

To build Python bindings using pybind11:

	./configure --with-python-bindings
	make
	make python

pybind11 is detected automatically via pip. If not installed:

	pip install pybind11

Additional options:

	# Specify pybind11 headers location
	./configure --with-python-bindings --with-pybind-incdir=/path/to/pybind11/include

	# Specify Python executable
	./configure --with-python-bindings --python-bin=/path/to/python

### Boost.Python (legacy)

To use Boost.Python instead:

	./configure --with-boost-python-bindings --with-boost=/path/to/boost
	make
	make python

### Installing Python bindings

Install to the system Python path:

	make python-install

Or add the library directory to your PYTHONPATH:

	export PYTHONPATH=/path/to/LeptonWeighter/lib:$PYTHONPATH

### Using the Python module

After installation:

```python
import LeptonWeighter as LW

# Create a flux model
flux = LW.PowerLawFlux(1e-18, 2.0, 1e5)

# Load cross sections from splines
xs = LW.CrossSectionFromSpline("cc_nu.fits", "cc_nubar.fits",
                                "nc_nu.fits", "nc_nubar.fits")

# Load generators from LIC file
generators = LW.MakeGeneratorsFromLICFile("simulation.lic")

# Create weighter
weighter = LW.Weighter(flux, xs, generators)

# Weight an event
event = LW.Event()
event.energy = 1e5  # GeV
event.zenith = 1.0  # radians
# ... set other event properties
weight = weighter.weight(event)
```

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

### nuSQuIDS

nuSQuIDS provides advanced neutrino physics functionality. When nuSQuIDS is available, the following features are enabled:

**C++ library:**
* `GlashowResonanceCrossSection` class - Glashow resonance cross section calculations
* `Weighter::get_effective_tau_weight()` - Effective tau neutrino weighting with tau decay corrections
* `Weighter::get_effective_tau_oneweight()` - Effective tau neutrino one-weight calculation

**Python bindings:**
* `nuSQUIDSAtmFlux` - Atmospheric neutrino flux from nuSQuIDS
* `nuSQUIDSFlux` - General nuSQuIDS flux interface
* `GlashowResonanceCrossSection` - Glashow resonance cross section

To enable nuSQuIDS support:

	./configure --with-nusquids=/path/to/nusquids

### nuflux

nuflux provides conventional and prompt atmospheric neutrino flux models. When nuflux is available, the `NFluxInterface` class is enabled for using nuflux flux models.

Note: nuflux requires Boost headers (for `boost::shared_ptr`).

To enable nuflux support:

	./configure --with-nuflux=/path/to/nuflux

Detailed Author Contributions
-----------------------------

The LeptonInjector and LeptonWeighter modules were motivated by the high-energy light sterile neutrino search performed by B. Jones and C. Arguelles. C. Weaver wrote the first implementation of LeptonInjector using the IceCube internal software framework, icetray, and wrote the specifications for LeptonWeighter. In doing so, he also significantly enhanced the functionality of IceCube's Earth-model service. These weighting specifications were turned into code by C. Arguelles in LeptonWeighter. B. Jones performed the first detailed Monte Carlo comparisons that showed that this code had similar performance to the standard IceCube neutrino generator at the time for throughgoing muon neutrinos.

It was realized that these codes could have use beyond IceCube and could benefit the broader neutrino community. The codes were copied from IceCube internal subversion repositories to this GitHub repository; unfortunately, the code commit history was not preserved in this process. Thus the current commits do not represent the contributions from the original authors, particularly from the initial work by C. Weaver and C. Arguelles.

The transition to this public version of the code has been spearheaded by A. Schneider and B. Smithers, with significant input and contributions from C. Weaver and C. Arguelles. B. Smithers isolated the components of the code needed to make the code public, edited the examples, and improved the interface of the code. A. Schneider contributed to improving the weighting algorithm, particularly to making it work for volume mode cascades, as well as in writing the general weighting formalism that enables joint weighting of volume and range mode.

This project also received contributions and suggestions from internal IceCube reviewers and the collaboration as a whole.
