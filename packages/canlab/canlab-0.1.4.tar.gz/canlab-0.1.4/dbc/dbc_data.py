        scale: the factor by which the integer in the CAN frame must be multiplied by to get one with physical meaning.
        offset: the factor by which the value in the CAN frame is shifted from the true value
        isSigned: a flag represening if the signal is signed or unsigned.
        name: the name of the signal.
        isLSB: if the signal is in LSB format
        value: the value with physical meaning (defaults to 0.0).
