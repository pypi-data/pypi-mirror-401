# Comprehensive test workflow that exercises all workflow model branches
# This TOML file tests all action types with valid field combinations
#
# This file is used by tests/test_workflow_loading.py to verify that:
# 1. All action types can be loaded from TOML (except callable which requires Python objects)
# 2. All validation branches are exercised with valid configurations
# 3. Field validation works correctly for file and docker actions
# 4. Complex workflow configurations can be parsed successfully
#
# Coverage includes:
# - All action types: claude, docker, file, git, github, shell, template
# - All file commands: append, copy, delete (path & pattern), move, rename, write
# - All docker commands: build, extract, pull, push (with and without tags)
# - Both local and remote conditions
# - Complex filter configurations
# - Action-level conditions and failure handling
