"""Read FLIMbox data and related files (FBD, FBF, and FBS.XML).

Fbdfile is a Python library to read FLIMbox data (FBD), firmware (FBF), and
setting (FBS.XML) files. The FLIMbox is an FPGA-based device for high
bandwidth, multi-channel data collection for fluorescence lifetime-resolved
imaging (FLIM) from a pulsed laser scanning confocal microscope.
The files are written by SimFCS and ISS VistaVision software.

Notes
-----

The API is not stable yet and might change between revisions.

Python <= 3.10 is no longer supported. 32-bit versions are deprecated.

The latest Microsoft Visual C++ Redistributable for Visual Studio 2015-2022
is required on Windows.

The FLIMbox formats are not documented and might change arbitrarily.
This implementation is based on reverse engineering existing files.
No guarantee can be made as to the correctness of code and documentation.

`SimFCS <https://www.lfd.uci.edu/globals/>`_, a.k.a. Globals for Images,
is software for fluorescence image acquisition, analysis, and simulation,
developed by Enrico Gratton at UCI.

`VistaVision <http://www.iss.com/microscopy/software/vistavision.html>`_
is commercial software for instrument control, data acquisition, and data
processing by ISS Inc (Champaign, IL).

Examples
--------

Read a FLIM lifetime image and metadata from an FBD file:

>>> with FbdFile('tests/data/flimbox_data$CBCO.fbd') as fbd:
...     bins, times, markers = fbd.decode()
...     image = fbd.asimage()
...
>>> image.shape
(1, 2, 256, 256, 64)
>>> print(bins[0, :2], times[:2], markers[:2])
[50 58] [ 0 32] [1944097 2024815]
>>> import numpy
>>> hist = [numpy.bincount(b[b >= 0]) for b in bins]
>>> int(hist[0].argmax())
53

View the histogram and metadata in a FLIMbox data file from the console::

    $ python -m fbdfile tests/data/flimbox_data$CBCO.fbd

@final
class FbdFile(BinaryFile):
    """FLIMbox data file.

    FBD files contain encoded data from the FLIMbox device, storing a
    stream of 16-bit or 32-bit integers (data words) that can be decoded to
    photon arrival windows, channels, and times.

    The measurement's frame size, pixel dwell time, number of sampling
    windows, and scanner type are encoded in the last four characters of the
    file name.
    Newer FBD files, where the 3rd character in the file name tag is `0`,
    start with the first 1kB of the firmware file used for the measurement,
    followed by 31kB containing a binary record with measurement settings.
    FBD files written by VistaVision are accompanied by FBS.XML setting
    files.

    It depends on the application and its settings how to interpret the
    decoded data, for example, as time series, line scans, or image frames
    of FCS or digital frequency domain fluorescence lifetime measurements.

    The data word format depends on the device's firmware.
    A common layout is::

        |F|E|D|C|B|A|9|8|7|6|5|4|3|2|1|0|  data word bits
                            |-----------|  pcc (cross correlation phase)
                        |---------------|  tcc (cross correlation time)
                      |-|                  marker (indicates start of frame)
        |-------------|                    index into decoder table

    The data word can be decoded into a cross correlation phase histogram
    index (shown for the 1st harmonics)::

        bin = (pmax-1 - (pcc + win * (pmax//windows)) % pmax) // pdiv

    - ``bin``, cross correlation phase index (phase histogram bin number).
    - ``pcc``, cross correlation phase (counter).
    - ``pmax``, number of entries in cross correlation phase histogram.
    - ``pdiv``, divisor to reduce number of entries in phase histogram.
    - ``win``, arrival window.
    - ``windows``, number of sampling windows.

    The current implementation uses a decoder table to decode arrival windows
    for each channel. This method is inefficient for 32-bit FLIMbox data
    with large number of windows and channels.

    Parameters:
        file:
            File name or seekable binary stream.
        code:
            Four-character string, encoding frame size (1st char),
            pixel dwell time (2nd char), number of sampling windows
            (3rd char), and scanner type (4th char).
            By default, the code is extracted from the file name.
        decoder:
            Name of decoder settings function.
        fbf:
            FLIMbox firmware header settings.
            By default, firmware settings are loaded from the file header,
            if any.
        fbs:
            FLIMbox settings from FBS.XML file.
            By default, settings are loaded from companion file, if any.
        frame_size:
            Number of pixels in one line scan, excluding retrace.
        windows:
            Number of sampling windows used by FLIMbox.
        channels:
            Number of channels used by FLIMbox.
        harmonics:
            First or second harmonics.
        pdiv:
            Divisor to reduce number of entries in phase histogram.
        pixel_dwell_time:
            Number of microseconds the scanner remains at each pixel.
        laser_frequency:
            Laser frequency in Hz.
            The default is 20000000 Hz, the internal FLIMbox frequency.
        laser_factor:
            Factor to correct dwell_time/laser_frequency.
            Use when the scanner clock is not known exactly.
        scanner_line_length:
            Number of pixels in each line, including retrace.
        scanner_line_start:
            Index of first valid pixel in scan line.
        scanner_frame_start:
            Index of first valid pixel after marker.
        scanner:
            Scanner software or hardware.
        synthesizer:
            Synthesizer software or hardware.
