"""
File System Tool (Read-Only)

Demonstrates:
  • Side effect awareness (file operations can be dangerous!)
  • Sandbox restrictions (only read from project directory)
  • Security best practices (path traversal prevention)

Kurral side effect protection:
  - First replay generates side_effect/side_effects.yaml
  - You review and mark tools as safe/dangerous
  - Kurral blocks dangerous operations during replay
  - This file_read tool will be marked as "needs review"

Security notes:
  - READ ONLY: No write, delete, or modify operations
  - SANDBOXED: Can only read files in project directory
  - VALIDATED: Prevents path traversal attacks (../, symlinks)
