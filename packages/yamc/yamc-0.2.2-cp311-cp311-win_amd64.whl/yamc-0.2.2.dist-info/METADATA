# YAMC

YAMC (Yet Another Monte Carlo) is an **open-source, general-purpose Monte Carlo neutron transport code**, developed independently for **research and educational use**.

The software implements core Monte Carlo transport algorithms for neutrons in arbitrary geometries and is intended for **scientific experimentation, teaching, and method development** in computational particle transport.

See the 👉 **[documentation](https://fusion-neutronics.github.io/yamc/)** 👈 for installation and usage details.

🦀 Rust is used for the core logic to deliver high performance and strong compile-time safety guarantees. It also provides cross-platform support across major operating systems and architectures (e.g., Linux, macOS, Windows; x86_64 and ARM) while enabling robust, low-overhead Python bindings.

🐍 Python API for ease of use. The Python API consists of thin, zero-compute wrappers around Rust functions implemented independently and is designed to be syntactically compatible with OpenMC to enable easy comparison, verification and familiarity. All computational logic is implemented in Rust.
