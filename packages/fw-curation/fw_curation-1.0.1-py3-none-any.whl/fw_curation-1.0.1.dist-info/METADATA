# fw-curation

`fw-curation` is a python package maintained by [Flywheel](https://flywheel.io)
It provides a set of utilities for writing SDK scripts to perform curation.

## Installation

The package can be installed using pip or a preferred package dependency management
tool using python 3.10 or later.

```bash
pip install fw-curation
```

## Documentation

The documentation for `fw-curation` can be found on the
[Flywheel Scientific Solutions documentation site](https://flywheel-io.gitlab.io/scientific-solutions/lib/fw-curation).

## Contributing

### Building

The dependency and virtual environment manager for `fw-curation` is [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

``` bash
uv sync
```

### Testing, Linting, Building Documentation

Linting, testing, and documentation building are all done using `pre-commit`.

Pre-commit hooks are installed by running `pre-commit install`. After hooks are
installed, they will automatically be run on each `git commit`. They can all be skipped
by running `git commit --no-verify` or specific hooks can be skipped by setting the
environmental variable, ex. `SKIP=test:pre-commit:pytest git commit`.

Individual hooks can also be run independently. For example, to run `pyproject_export`
to update the `requirements.txt` and `requirements-dev.txt` files, you can run
`pre-commit run pyproject_export -a`. For a list of hooks, view the
[pre-commit-config](.pre-commit-config.yaml).

### Managing Dependencies

To add new dependencies to this repo, use [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and follow
the below steps:

```bash
# Install my-package:
uv add my-package
# Or install my-package as part of the required packages for development:
uv add --group dev my-package
```

To update dependencies with uv:

```bash
uv sync --upgrade
```

To remove dependencies with uv:

```bash
uv remove my-package
```
