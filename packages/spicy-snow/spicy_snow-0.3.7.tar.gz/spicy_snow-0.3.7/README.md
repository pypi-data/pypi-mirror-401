# spicy-snow

Python module to use volumetric scattering at C-band to calculate snow depths from Sentinel-1 imagery using Lieven et al.'s 2021 technique.

The relevant papers for this repository technique are:

Lievens et al 2019 - https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-12566-y

Lievens et al 2021 - https://tc.copernicus.org/articles/16/159/2022/

## Example Installation

```sh
pip install spicy-snow
```

## Example usage:

```python

# Add main repo to path if not pip installed
# import sys
# sys.path.append('path/to/the/spicy-snow/')

from pathlib import Path
from spicy_snow.retrieval import retrieve_snow_depth

# change to your minimum longitude, min lat, max long, max lat
test_aoi = [-114.5, 43, -114, 44]

# can also be a point for point based retrievals
# test_aoi = [-114.2, 43.75]

# you will want to start before the snowfalls since this is a change detection method
dates = ['2020-10-01', '2021-05-01']

# this will be where your results are saved
out_nc = Path('./test.nc').resolve()

# resolution in meters to work at (100, 500, 1km all have been tested).
# default is 100 meters
spatial_resolution = 100

# data source can be either "opera" RTC or "hyp3" cloud processed
# opera is much faster and doesn't require hyp3 credits
# hyp3 uses gamma processing and may be cleaner
source = 'opera' # other option "hyp3"

spicy_ds = retrieve_snow_depth(aoi = test_aoi, dates = dates, 
                               work_dir = Path('./spicy-test/').resolve(), 
                               resolution = spatial_resolution,
                               debug=False,
                               source = source,
                               outfp=out_nc)
```




## Description of the output netcdf variables.

 - wet_snow: layer showing layers flagged as wet snow (1 = wet, 0 = dry)
 - snow_depth: derived snow depth in meters
 - snowcover: snow coverage binary mask (True = snow on, False = snow-free)
 - fcf: forest coverage percentage
 - vv: gamma0 sentinel-1 VV backscatter in dB
 - vh: gamma0 sentinel-1 VH backscatter in dB

All the other layers are intermediate layers for if you want to explore the processing pipeline.

## Data Sources

Sentinel-1 RTCs are downloaded from the Alaska Satellite Facility and processed by [JPL's Opera Project](https://github.com/opera-adt/RTC). Forest cover within CONUS comes from the National Land Cover Database, otherwise from the Proba-V forest cover. Snow coverage is from the VIIRS snow cover product. See and use citations below.
