    The main entrypoint for browser automation. This engine exposes the main entry point which is the run() method

        `vertexai_project_id`: Create a VertexAI project to use that instead of OpenAI
        `vertexai_server_location`: VertexAI server location
        `gemini_api_key`: API key for Gemini-2.5-pro native support without VertexAI
        `headless`: Choose if you want to run in the headless mode or not
        `handle_dependencies`: Choose if you want to automatically install dependencies during runtime
        `use_logger`: Choose if you want to use the logger (that is enable logging of data)
        `enable_tracing`: Choose if you want to enable tracing. This will create a .zip file which you can use in traceviewer

        `database`: An instance of the Database class which will define all database specific configs

    Find these default values at `pyba/config.yaml`.

    The `Engine` is inherited off from the `BaseEngine`. The BaseEngine handles the common methods for
    all the modes (default, DFS and BFS). The main `Engine` decides if execution needs to be passed to a different
    mode depending on what is set by the user.

        would return data **during** the execution, and now once it finishes. It will dump it in the database as well, and it
        decides if data needs to be extracted on an action basis.

        Using this feature will NOT cost you any more tokens than usual.
