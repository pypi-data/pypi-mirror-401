class BaseFuture(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class providing a unified future interface.

    This class serves as an abstraction layer that unifies different types of futures from various frameworks:
    - Python's standard `concurrent.futures.Future`
    - `asyncio.Future`
    - Ray's `ObjectRef`
    - Synchronous results (wrapped for API compatibility)

    The API closely mirrors Python's `concurrent.futures.Future` to ensure familiarity and compatibility.

    Implementation:
    --------------
    BaseFuture and all its subclasses are implemented using __slots__ for performance:

    - **High Performance**: Optimized initialization with __slots__ and fast UUID generation
    - **Memory Efficient**: __slots__ reduces memory overhead per instance
    - **Type Safety**: Runtime validation at construction time with clear error messages
    - **Thread Safety**: Fast UUID generation using `id(self)` (~0.01µs vs 2.5µs for os.urandom)

    Each subclass defines __slots__ and implements the abstract methods for their specific
    execution framework.

    Key Benefits:
    ------------
    1. **Framework Agnostic**: Code can work with futures without needing to know their specific framework.
       The `wrap_future()` function automatically converts any future-like object into this unified interface.

    2. **Consistent API**: Provides a common interface (Adapter pattern) across all future types with:
        - `__await__` support for async/await syntax
        - Consistent timeout and error handling
        - Uniform callback mechanisms

    3. **Thread-Safe**: All operations are thread-safe when a lock is provided. Implementations use locks
       to ensure thread-safety except for futures like SyncFuture that don't need it.

    4. **Extensible**: New future types can be easily added by implementing this interface, allowing
       support for additional frameworks.

    5. **Type-Safe**: Runtime validation at construction time with clear error messages for incorrect types.

    Behavioral Guarantees:
    ---------------------
    All implementations of BaseFuture provide identical behavior through the public API:

    1. **Exception Types**: All futures raise the same exception types for the same conditions:
        - `concurrent.futures.CancelledError` when accessing a cancelled future
        - `TimeoutError` when operations exceed the specified timeout
        - Original exception from the computation when it fails

       Note: Even `asyncio.Future` raises `concurrent.futures.CancelledError` (not `asyncio.CancelledError`)
       for API consistency.

    2. **Callbacks**: All `add_done_callback()` implementations pass the wrapper future (not the underlying
       framework future) to the callback. Callbacks are called exactly once when the future completes.

    3. **Cancellation**: `cancel()` returns False if the future is already done, True if cancellation succeeded.
       Once cancelled, `result()` and `exception()` raise `CancelledError`.

    4. **Blocking Behavior**: `result()` and `exception()` block until the future completes (unless a timeout
       is specified). Both methods respect the timeout parameter consistently.

    5. **Await Support**: All futures support async/await syntax through `__await__`, making them usable
       in async contexts regardless of the underlying framework.

    Thread Safety:
    --------------
    All future operations are thread-safe. Each future maintains a private lock (`_lock`) used to
    synchronize access to internal state. SyncFuture sets this to None as it doesn't need locking.

    Private Members:
    ---------------
    Subclasses should define __slots__ with these common attributes:

    - `uuid`: Unique identifier for the future
    - `_result`: The computed result (or None if not yet available)
    - `_exception`: The exception raised (or None if successful)
    - `_done`: Whether the future has completed
    - `_cancelled`: Whether the future was cancelled
    - `_callbacks`: List of callbacks to invoke when done
    - `_lock`: Thread lock for synchronization (None for SyncFuture)

    Framework-specific private members (like `_future`, `_loop`, `_object_ref`) are defined only
    on the subclasses that need them.

        Implementation:
        --------------
        RayFuture is an optimized __slots__-based wrapper for Ray's `ObjectRef`:

        - **Performance**: Fast UUID generation using `id(self)` (~0.01µs)
        - **Thread-Safe**: Uses an internal lock to ensure thread-safe state management
        - **Type-Safe**: Validates the wrapped object_ref is a Ray `ObjectRef` at construction
        - **Exception Conversion**: Converts Ray's `GetTimeoutError` to standard `TimeoutError`
        - **Callback Support**: Implements proper callback invocation on completion
        - **State Tracking**: Maintains internal state for completion, cancellation, and results

        Args:
            object_ref: A Ray `ObjectRef` instance. Must be a valid Ray ObjectRef object.

        Raises:

    This function automatically detects the type of future and wraps it in the
    appropriate BaseFuture subclass. It's the main entry point for using the
    unified future interface.

    Args:
        future: A future-like object from any execution framework. Supported types:
            - `BaseFuture` (returned as-is)
            - `concurrent.futures.Future`
            - `asyncio.Future` or `asyncio.Task`
            - Coroutine (scheduled on current running event loop)
            - Ray's `ObjectRef` (if Ray is installed)
            - Any other object (wrapped as `SyncFuture` with the object as result)

    Returns:
        A BaseFuture instance providing the unified interface

    Example:

        import asyncio

        # Works with threading futures

    Note:
        If the input is already a BaseFuture, it's returned as-is without wrapping.
