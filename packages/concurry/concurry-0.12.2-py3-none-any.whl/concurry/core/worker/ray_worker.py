# When you define an async method in a Ray actor and call it with .remote(),
# Ray automatically handles the async execution.
#
# TODO: For optimal async performance with Ray, we could:
# 1. Detect async methods and use Ray's async actor APIs
# 2. Leverage Ray's asyncio integration for concurrent task execution
# 3. Use Ray's async/await support for better concurrency within actors
#
# For now, Ray's default behavior correctly executes async functions,
# though it may not provide the same level of concurrent execution as
# a dedicated event loop (like AsyncioWorkerProxy).

class RayWorkerProxy(WorkerProxy):
    """Worker proxy for Ray-based execution.

    This proxy uses Ray actors to execute methods in a distributed manner.

    **Default Resource Allocation:**

    - `num_cpus = 1`: Each Ray actor is allocated 1 CPU by default
    - `num_gpus = 0`: No GPU allocation by default
    - `resources = None`: No custom resources by default

    These defaults ensure Ray actors are created without requiring explicit
    resource specifications, while still allowing users to override as needed.

    **Exception Handling:**

    - Setup errors (e.g., `AttributeError` for non-existent methods) fail immediately
    - Execution errors are wrapped by Ray in `RayTaskError` (Ray's standard behavior)
    - Original exception information is preserved in the Ray error message

    **Async Function Support:**

    Ray has native support for async methods in actors - they work automatically.
    For TaskWorker with async functions, they are wrapped to execute correctly
    but won't provide the same concurrency benefits as `AsyncioWorkerProxy`.

    **Future Unwrapping with Zero-Copy Optimization:**

    When passing RayFuture instances from one Ray worker to another, the underlying
    ObjectRef is passed directly (zero-copy), avoiding data serialization. For futures
    from other worker types, values are materialized before passing. This optimization
    is automatic when `unwrap_futures=True` (default).

    **Example:**

        ```python
        import asyncio

        class MyWorker(Worker):
            async def async_method(self, x: int) -> int:
                await asyncio.sleep(0.01)
                return x * 2

        # Use defaults (1 CPU, 0 GPUs)
        w = MyWorker.options(mode="ray").init()
        result = w.async_method(5).result()  # Works with Ray's native async support

        # Override resources
        w = MyWorker.options(mode="ray", actor_options={"num_cpus": 2, "num_gpus": 1}).init()

        # Specify custom resources
        w = MyWorker.options(
            mode="ray",
            actor_options={"resources": {"special_hardware": 1}}
        ).init()

        w.stop()
