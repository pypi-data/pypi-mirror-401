# ## Prerequisites
#
# First install and import the required dependencies:
# WINDOWS_COMMENT_BLOCK

# +
# %pip install DEPENDENCIES
# -

# +
IMPORTS_BLOCK
# -

# Then define some utility functions to handle dataframes and plot results:

# +
UTILS_BLOCK
# -

# ### Context
#
# Next, we'll define our Context. This is where we set the privacy budget,
# and the columns that will be part of the synthetic dataset.

SYNTH_CONTEXT_BLOCK

# CSV_COMMENT_BLOCK
#
# ## Results
#
# First, we'll release a contingency table, a data structure which can give us
# DP counts for different combinations of column values.

SYNTH_QUERY_BLOCK

# If we try to run more queries at this point, it will error. Once the privacy budget
# is consumed, the library prevents you from running any more queries.
#
# If there are lots of null values, it may mean that the OpenDP library was not able to
# collect enough information to describe your dataset within the privacy budget.
# You might try:
# - Increasing your privacy budget
# - Selecting fewer columns
# - Selecting fewer cutpoints
# - Filling in the "keys" kwarg
# - Preprocessing to combine keys which occur a small number of times

# # Coda
# The code below produces a summary report.
