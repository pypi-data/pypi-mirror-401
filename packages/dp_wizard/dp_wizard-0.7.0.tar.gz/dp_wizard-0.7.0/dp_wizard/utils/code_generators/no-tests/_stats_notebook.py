# ## Analysis
#
# Based on the input you provided, for each column we'll create a Polars expression
# that describes how we want to summarize that column.

COLUMNS_BLOCK

# ### Context
#
# Next, we'll define our Context. This is where we set the privacy budget,
# and set the weight for each query under that overall budget.

STATS_CONTEXT_BLOCK

# CSV_COMMENT_BLOCK
#
# ## Results
#
# Finally, we run the queries and plot the results.

STATS_QUERIES_BLOCK

# If we try to run more queries at this point, it will error. Once the privacy budget
# is consumed, the library prevents you from running any more queries.
