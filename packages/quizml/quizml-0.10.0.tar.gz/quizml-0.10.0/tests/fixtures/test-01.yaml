    Consider the dataset below:

    ![](tests/fixtures/figures/dogcat.jpg){width=30em }

    Explain how you could design a classification system for this dataset.

  answer: |
    We could go back to difference equations or we can go directly:
    $$
      Y(z) = \frac{1}{2}\left( X(z) + X(-z) \right)
    $$
