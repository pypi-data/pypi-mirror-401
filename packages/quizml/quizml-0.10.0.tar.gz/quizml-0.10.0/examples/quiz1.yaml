    If vector ${\bf w}$ is of dimension $3 \times 1$ and matrix ${\bf A}$ of
    dimension $5 \times 3$, then what is the dimension of $\left({\bf w}^{\top}{\bf
    A}^{\top}{\bf A}{\bf w}\right)^{\top}$?
  choices:
    - o:  $5\times 5$
    - o:  $3\times 3$
    - o:  $3\times 1$
    - x:  $1\times 1$
