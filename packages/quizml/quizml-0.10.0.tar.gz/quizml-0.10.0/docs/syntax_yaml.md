## Test File Syntax <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

QuizML takes in a YAML file. [YAML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML) is a
generic human-readable data-serialization language, typically used for
configuration files, and it is used here to define the questions' statements,
marks, type, answers, etc.

One motivation behind using YAML is that all text entries (e.g., question
statements, answers, etc.) can be written in
[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and with a few extensions,
it is possible write LaTeX equations, and it will be very similar, in feel and
capabilities to LaTeX.

Below is an longer example of what an exam script would look like:

?> QuizML avoids some of the YAML oddities such as the [Norway
Problem](https://hitchdev.com/strictyaml/why/implicit-typing-removed) by
interpreting yaml fields according to the provided schema definition (see
[Schema Validation](schema_validation) for more information).
