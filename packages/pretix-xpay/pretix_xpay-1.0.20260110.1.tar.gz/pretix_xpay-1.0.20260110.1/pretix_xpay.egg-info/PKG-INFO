Accept payments through the Nexi's XPay interface

This implements the XPay Italian legacy system (https://ecommerce.nexi.it/specifiche-tecniche/), which should be implemented (as stated by the Nexi's support) if you haven't subscribed a contract with Banca Intesa or ex consorzio triveneto.
We started implementing the XPay global/italian system (https://developer.nexi.it/en/servizio-ecommerce), but after a while we discovered we were using the other system so we stopped.
You can find the implementation on the other branch (https://github.com/APSfurizon/pretix-xpay/tree/xpay-global).
