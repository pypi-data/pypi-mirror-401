*** Major Fixes ***

Upgraded to Java 25, partly due to memory leak in J24
AC frequency now calculates to full resolution (was limited to integer)
Synthetic channels all now round (some were trimming the final value)
Incorrect 'host time' was shown after the first stream
Inconsistent measurement points could be read (cursors Vs CSV, Vs summary data)

Apple menus were not consistent with best practice on other apps
