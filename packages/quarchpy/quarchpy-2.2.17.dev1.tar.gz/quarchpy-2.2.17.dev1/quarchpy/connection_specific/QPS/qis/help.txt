QIS v1.51

qis:

	Greatly simplifies the task of interfacing user scripts to the PPM. All time dependent code and 
	data decoding is hidden behind a TCP/IP server interface supporting both REST and raw TCP protocols.
	In addition, the live stream data passes through an internal intermediary buffer further simplifying
	the timing requirements of any interfacing scripts.
	   
	On startup, qis creates a toolbar icon and optionally displays the inbuilt terminal interface. A 
	right click on the toolbar icon displays a menu with the following options:
		About
		Show Terminal
		Exit
		
	The Show Terminal menu item may appear disable/grayed out in the following circumstances
		A terminal window is already open
		The inbuilt terminal interface is disabled, see "The inbuilt terminal window".

	
Command line parameters:

	The files qis.bat, qis-NoGUI.bat (Windows) and qis.sh, qis-NoGUI.sh (Linux) contain examples of 
	command line parameter usage.

	-terminal 
		Displays a terminal window on application start. N.B. Only valid when the terminal window
		option is unlocked where locked is defined as when the file disableterminal.txt exists
		and is set to read only.

	-loglevel=OFF,FATAL,ERROR,WARN,INFO,DEBUG,TRACE,ALL
	    Sets the logging level, which by default is set to INFO

	-logconsole
	    Log to the console as well as to file
		
	-devdebug
		Enables development debug output to the console
		
	-devdebug2
		Enables devdebug and some more costly debug output
		
	-Djava.awt.headless=true
		This is a Java environment setting where Java is configured to run without GUI components 
		and qis will run in headless mode, no system tray icon or terminal window so interaction
		is only possible via a separate REST or TCP application.

	-port
	    Allows user to specify the telnet port to use

	-restport
	    Allows user to specify the rest port to use


Client side connections:

	REST is accepted on port 9780
	TCP  is accepted on port 9722, NB it is possible to connect via a standard Telnet client if said
	client supports raw mode, I recommend Putty.
	
	These port settings can be found and changed in the qis local directory file qis.properties.

	
The inbuilt terminal window:

	At startup qis opens a command/terminal window allowing the user immediate interaction without the
	need to script a connection or track down a copy of Putty. The opening of terminal window may be
	prevented by setting the qis local directory file disableterminal.txt to read only.
	

$ Commands internal to qis:

	$help
		Displays copyright, license and help information.
		 
	$list 			
		List attached devices, eg
		
		1) usb::qtl1847-01-016
		2) rest::qtl1944-01-020
		3) tcp::qtl1944-01-020

	$list details
		List attached devices with additional information, eg
		
		1) usb::QTL1847-01-016 Port:9 Stream:Yes Name:XLC Programmable Power Module
		2) rest::QTL1999-02-020 IP:192.168.1.90 Port:80 NBName:1999-02-020 Stream:Yes Name:HD Programmable Power Module +Triggering
		3) tcp::QTL1999-02-020 IP:192.168.1.90 Port:9760 NBName:1999-02-020 Stream:Yes Name:HD Programmable Power Module +Triggering

	$scan
		Perform a scan for connected network attached devices via UPD port 30303. This command returns immediately 
		but the actual scan takes about 3 seconds to complete. It is recommended to wait 3 seconds before executing
		any other command. 
		
		N.B. USB devices are scanned automatically.

	$scan TCPIPdevicespecifier 
		Scan for a device at a specific tcp/ip address, eg
	
		$scan tcp::192.168.1.90
		Located Device: qtl1944-01-020
		
		$scan tcp::192.168.1.91
		No Quarch Device Found at: 192.168.1.91

		$scan tcp::NetBIOSName
	
		Once a device tcp/ip address has been scanned successfully the device will appear in the $list
		and is available for use.
	
	$scan?
		Returns state of USB and Ethernet scanners. Ethernet information includes scan time in mS
		
	$scan -tinteger
		Integer value is in milliseconds (1000 = 1 second). Sets the Ethernet scan timer to the specified value, if the value is 0 the
		automatic scan is stopped. The minimum realistic scan time is 10mS, the default is 20000mS (20 seconds)
	
	$debug [on|off]

		$default tcp::qtl1944-01-020
		hello?
		HD Programmable Power Module +Triggering
	
		The default device is unique to each client side connection, though due to the nature of
		http it may be unwise to rely on the connection been maintained during a REST session.
		
	$default deviceListEntryNumber
	$def deviceListEntryNumber
		set device as default for all device commands, eg
		
		Assuming the $list command returns

		$default?
		Default Device tcp::qtl1944-01-020

	$loglevel [level]
	    Sets the log-level
	    Of the form: $loglevel DEBUG, with valid options: [OFF, FATAL, ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE, ALL]
	$loglevel?
	    Returns the current log-level

	$sysinfo
		Displays memory usage and stream task information, eg

	$load filter [directory path]
		Loads all filter XML files found in the provided directory path - XML files must follow the standard layout.

Non $ Commands internal to qis:

	Although the stream command is executed internally by qis it differs from the $ commands in that
	the targeted device may be specified on the stream command line, eg
		
		stream text header
			Returns the stream header information from the most recent stream to be run on the current
			default device.

		usb::qtl1824-03-161 stream text header
			Returns the stream header information form the most recent stream to be run on 
			device usb::qtl1824-03-161

	stream?
		Returns running status and buffer information for the current stream operation, eg
		
		Stopped: User
		Stripes Buffered: 94 of 8388608
		
		Running
		Stripes Buffered: 1167 of 8388608

	stream text header
		Returns header information for the current stream operation eg

		stream text header
		Version: 5
		Format: 15
		Average: 14
	
		See Appendix A for examples of the header data returned by this command.
	
	stream text [all|number of stripes]
		The option all is subject to a limit of 3072 stripes.
		To ease timing considerations, qis implements an internal buffer of approximately
		8 million stripes.
		Returns N stripes in formatted ASCII text from the stream buffer, the format of each line is:
        
        sampleAverageTime(uS) [group 0 channel data] [group 1 channel data] ...
        
        The following example is for a PPM with the single group 0 and 4 channels [5V(V), 5V(A), 12V(V), 12V(A)]
        with the channel values corresponding to their dataPosition value in the stream text header XML:
        
        stream text 3
        0    947 59 948 -26
        4096 947 57 948 -27
        8192 947 58 948 -26

	stream buffer text [all|number of stripes]
		PAM only, text is derived directly from the buffer and returned in a simple record by record 
		format.
	
	stream bin [all|number of stripes]
		The option all is subject to a limit of 4096 stripes.
		To ease timing considerations, qis implements an internal buffer of approximately
		8 million stripes.
		Returns N stripes in binary format from the stream buffer.

	stream mode power [enable|disable]
		HD / XLC only. Enable/disable internal power calculation. Only valid when both voltage and current
		values are available for a given channel. Default is disabled
		
	stream mode power total [enable|disable]
		HD / XLC only. Enable/disable internal power calculation and total power calculation. Only valid
		when two or more power calculations are enabled. Default is disabled and once enabled a stream 
		mode power [enable|disable] command will disable this option
	
	stream mode header [v1|v2|v3]
		PAM / HD / XLC only. Specify header mode. Default is device default. See Appendix A for header details.

	stream mode resample? 
	stream mode resample off
	stream mode resample 1..n[ms|us]
	stream mode resample group g 1..n[ms|us]
        In the case of a single-rate device "stream mode resample #" sets the re-sampling value to #. In the case of a
        multi-rate device "stream mode resample #" sets all groups to #.
		Force stream data to specified resample period. If device period > resample period, device period
		will be used.
		The absolute maximum resample time is 2,147,483,647us or about 2,147 seconds, this is untested!
        For example:
        stream mode resample 10mS           --> sets all groups to 10mS
        stream mode resample group 0 100mS  --> sets group 0 to 100mS
        stream mode resample group 1 200mS  --> sets group 1 to 200mS

	tcp::DeviceIdentifier forcereset
	
	tcp::DeviceIdentifier forceIPAddress aaa.bbb.ccc.ddd
	
	close
		closes the default or specified device connection. NB if a stream is in progress the stream is first stopped
		before the connection is closed therefore the actual close may happen a few seconds after the command is issued.
		For a USB connection any stream will be stopped
		For a TCP connection any stream will be stopped and the TCP connection will be closed
		
			close
			tcp::qtl1999-03-161 close

TCPIPdevicespecifier
	The TCP/IP device specifier has two general forms:
		interface::DeviceIdentifier
			tcp::qtl1944-01-020
			
		interface::IPAddress
			tcp::192.168.1.90
			
	Overrides for the protocol port number and message timeout may be appended to the device
	specifier, eg
		tcp::192.168.1.90:5432%3000
		
		Forces the device connection to use port number 5432 with a message timeout of 3000ms. The initial
		connection timeout for TCP is 10 times the message timeout. 
	

Any command not recognised by qis will be passed on to the current default device or to the device specified on the command line eg

	hello? 
	HD Programmable Power Module +Triggering
	
	usb::qtl1824-03-161 hello?
	XLC Programmable Power Module +Triggering

Appendix B: Synthetic Channel Functions

	stream create channel ...
		Creates a new channel.
	stream created channel delete ...
		Deletes a previously created channel.
	stream create channel enable ...
		Enables/Disables a previously created channel.
	stream created channels clear
		Deletes all previously created channels.
	stream created channels?
		Returns a list of all previously created channels.
	stream created channels enabled?
		Returns a list of previously created channels that are enabled.
	stream created channels disabled?
		Returns a list of previously created channels that are disabled.
	stream created function definitions?
		Returns an XML description of all supported functions.

A more detailed description, with examples, of each command follows:

	stream create channel chan(chName,chGroup) function(arg1, arg2, ...)
		A new synthetic channel is created by way of specifying a channel function using the chan() function, which takes
		arguments of the new channel name and its display group. Following the newly defined channel is the function name that
		takes two or more arguments. For example:
		
		stream create channel chan(L1_RMS,V) rms(100ms, chan(L1,V))
		
		Here we define a new synthetic channel called "L1_RMS" and assign it to the group "V". It is defined using the function rms(), which is
		short for the root mean square function. The rms() function takes two argument, the first being the time window and the second being a channel
		on which the RMS is calculated.
		
		Other examples are:
		
		chan(L1_pf,PF%) PowerFactor(chan(L1_PAct,W),chan(L1_PApp,VA))
		chan(L2_PApp,VA) pApparent(chan(L2_RMS,V),chan(L2_RMS,A))
		
	stream created channel delete chan(chName,chGroup)
		A previously defined channel is deleted using the delete command by specifying both the channel name and group. For example:
		
		stream created channel delete chan(L1_RMS,V)
	
	stream created channel enable chan(chName, chGroup) [ON|OFF]
		A previously defined channel is enabled or disabled using the enable command by specifying both the channel name and group. For example:
		
		stream created channel enable chan(L1_RMS,V) off
		
	stream created channels clear
		Deletes all previously created channels, and serves as a convenience command to the above in which all channels are
		deleted with a single command.
		
	stream created channels?
		Returns a list of all previously created channels. For example:
		
		stream created channels?
		
		could return the following list:
		
		chan(L1_RMS,V) rms(100mS, chan(L1,V))
		chan(L1_RMS,A) rms(100mS, chan(L1,A))
		...
	
	stream created channels enabled?
		Returns a list of enabled previously created channels For example:
		
		stream created channels enabled?
		
		could return the following list:
		
		chan(L1_RMS,V) rms(100mS, chan(L1,V))
		chan(L1_RMS,A) rms(100mS, chan(L1,A))
		...
	
	stream created channels disabled?
		Returns a list of disabled previously created channels For example:
		
		stream created channels disabled?
		
		could return the following list:
		
		chan(L1_RMS,V) rms(100mS, chan(L1,V))
		chan(L1_RMS,A) rms(100mS, chan(L1,A))
		...	
	
	stream created function definitions?
		Returns the XML schema used to define the supported synthetic channel functions. For example:
		
		>stream created function definitions?
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
		<functionDefinitions>
		<function>
		<name>rms</name>
		<returnType>int</returnType>
		<description>The effective value of a sinusoidal waveform which gives the same heating effect as an equivalent DC supply.</description>
		<parameters>
		<parameter>
		<name>window</name>
		<type>timeWindow</type>
		...
		
The currently supported synthetic channel functions are:

	average
	    The average of a channel over the specified time window.
	crestFactor
		The ratio of peak value to RMS value over the specified time window.
	expression
	    Defines a channel via an expression.
	frequency
		The frequency of the signal specified by the source channel.
	multiplier
        The scalar multiple of a single source channel or the product of at least two source channels.
	pActive
		The actual power which is transferred to the load / dissipated in the circuit.
	pApparent
		The product of RMS voltage and RMS current.
	phase
		The difference in phase, expressed in degrees, between the two source channels.
	pInstantaneous
		The product of voltage and current.
	powerFactor
		The ratio of the real power absorbed by the load to the apparent power flowing in the circuit.
	pReactive
		Power absorbed by and returned from the load due to its reactive properties.
	rms
		The effective value of a sinusoidal waveform which gives the same heating effect as an equivalent DC supply.
	sineWave
		A test function generating a sine wave based on the supplied parameters.
	subtract
		The difference of the specified channels.
	sum
		The sum of the specified channels.

Each of the above functions have differing arguments and return value and the best source of reference for each function's
details is via the XML function definitions command described above.
	
Appendix C: FAQ

	Why does the client side REST interface default to port number 9780 instead of the standard
	port 80?
	In their infinite wisdom the Windows 10 designers hijack port 80 for their own needs.  	
	
	When I try to launch qis I see a dialog box/terminal window saying the application is
	"Shutting Down".
	qis supports two client side interfaces, REST and TCP, if neither interface can be claimed
	there is no means of communicating with client software so the application shuts down.   
	
	Can I increase the amount of memory available to qis/java?
	See Java documentation for the -Xmx launch option. eg -Xmx4096m would allow java to use up to
	4GB of system ram.
