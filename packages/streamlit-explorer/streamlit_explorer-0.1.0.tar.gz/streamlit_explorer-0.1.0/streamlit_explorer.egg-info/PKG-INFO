    # Read and display the file
    with open(selected_file, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
        st.text(content)
```

## 📖 Usage Examples

### Basic Folder Selection

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_explorer import DirPicker

selected_folder = DirPicker(key="my_folder")

if selected_folder:
    st.success(f"Selected: {selected_folder}")
```

### File Selection with Extension Filter

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_explorer import FilePicker

# Filter for specific file types
selected_file = FilePicker(
    key="python_picker",
    file_extensions=['.py', '.pyw']
)

if selected_file:
    st.success(f"Selected Python file: {selected_file}")
```

### Custom Starting Path

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_explorer import DirPicker, FilePicker

# Start from a specific directory
folder = DirPicker(
    key="custom_folder",
    start_path="/home/user/projects"
)

file = FilePicker(
    key="custom_file",
    start_path="/home/user/documents"
)
```

### Multiple Pickers on Same Page

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_explorer import DirPicker, FilePicker

col1, col2 = st.columns(2)

with col1:
    st.subheader("Select Input Folder")
    input_folder = DirPicker(key="input_folder")

with col2:
    st.subheader("Select Output Folder")
    output_folder = DirPicker(key="output_folder")

st.subheader("Select Configuration File")
config_file = FilePicker(
    key="config_file",
    file_extensions=['.json', '.yaml', '.yml']
)
```

### Complete Application Example

```python
import streamlit as st
from streamlit_explorer import DirPicker, FilePicker
import os

st.title("📁 File Processing Application")

# Select source folder
st.header("1. Select Source Folder")
source_folder = DirPicker(key="source")

if source_folder:
    st.info(f"Source: {source_folder}")
    
    # Select destination folder
    st.header("2. Select Destination Folder")
    dest_folder = DirPicker(key="destination")
    
    if dest_folder:
        st.info(f"Destination: {dest_folder}")
        
        # Select files to process

                key="csv_file",
                start_path=source_folder,
                file_extensions=['.csv']
            )
        
        with col2:
            excel_file = FilePicker(

## 🎨 Features in Detail

### Navigation Controls

1. **Direct Path Entry**: Type or paste any valid path directly into the text input at the top
2. **Search Box**: Filter folders/files in real-time as you type (case-insensitive)
3. **Up Button (⬆️)**: Navigate to the parent directory (disabled at root)
4. **Back Button (⬅️)**: Return to the previous location in your navigation history
5. **Folder Buttons**: Click any folder to navigate into it
6. **File Buttons** (FilePicker only): Click any file to select it

### Scrollable Container

- Fixed height of 450px for the file/folder list
- Smooth scrolling for directories with many items
- Navigation controls remain accessible outside the scroll area

### Search Functionality

- Real-time filtering as you type
- Case-insensitive matching
- Searches both files and folders (in FilePicker)
- Clears automatically when navigating to a new folder

### File Extension Filtering

When using FilePicker with the `file_extensions` parameter:
- Only files with matching extensions are displayed
- Multiple extensions can be specified
- Folders are always shown for navigation
- Extensions must include the dot (`.txt`, not `txt`)

### Error Handling

- Gracefully handles permission denied errors
- Displays clear error messages
- Continues to function even when some directories are inaccessible
