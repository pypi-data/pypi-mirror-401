## Key features

- Stranded and hairpin winding generators
- Magnetic calculations: MMF, harmonics, and winding factors
- Slot current distribution and pin/connection details
- 2D visualization utilities for winding layouts and reports
- Example scripts and a lightweight web UI (see Quick links)

- Examples: [examples/](examples/)
- Web UI (optional): https://github.com/DawnEver/wdg-lab-webui

## Installation

Recommended: install from source (development mode).

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DawnEver/wdg-lab.git
cd wdg-lab
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment, uv is recommanded:
```bash
uv venv
# or use venv
pip -m venv .venv
```

3. Install the package
```bash
uv pip install -e . # for normal user
uv pip install -e ".[web]" # for web user
uv pip install -e ".[dev,web]" # for developer
```

## Quick start

- Generate a winding from parameters (examples include basic parameter sets):

```bash
python examples/gen_winding_from_params.py
```

- Generate a winding from winding configuration files:
```bash
python examples/gen_winding_from_toml.py
```

## Project layout

- `wdg_lab/` — core library modules and APIs
- `examples/` — runnable examples and small utilities
- `tests/` — unit tests and validation cases
