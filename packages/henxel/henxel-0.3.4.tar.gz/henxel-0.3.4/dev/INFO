Note on binding in tkinter:
1: Event is triggered in the widget that has focus but it has no binding for that event.
2: Widget is from such widget-class that has default bindging for this event.
3: The desired binding is in the nearest parent-widget.

Example, print bindtag-order of two widgets in python-console,
first widget is Text-widget and then Editor-widget
>>> e=henxel.Editor()
>>> e.contents.bindtags()
('.!editor.!text2', 'Text', '.!editor', 'all')

>>> e.bindtags()
('.!editor', 'Henxel', 'all')

Bindings are executed from left to right.

Example: in class Editor there is:
self.bind( "<Return>", self.do_nothing)

Then if focus is in Editor.contents (pressing newline in editor),
first to catch the event (after OS) is: '.!editor.!text2'
That is the Text-class-instance, if there is a binding for that event,

And there is:
self.contents.bind( "<Return>", self.return_override)

It is executed and if there is no 'break' returned, this Return-event will continue
to the next bindtag: 'Text' which has all the default bindings for a Text-class.
After that the event would be going to the parent widget, Editor-widget etc.


What is this for? Say one has a widget: Text-widget and binding to its parent Editor-widget like:
	self.bind( "<Return>", self.return_override_editor)
And there would not be binding like:
	self.contents.bind( "<Return>", self.return_override_text)
But then if Text-widget has focus and pressed Return: 'Text' class-bindings are executed before
Editor-widget and this might not be what one wants:
('.!editor.!text2', 'Text', '.!editor', 'all')

But that event can be unbinded, Example: Print current bindings for a class:
>>> e.contents.bind_class('Text')

Unbinding default binding of Text-widget:
e.contents.unbind_class('Text', '<Return>')
And then it works.
