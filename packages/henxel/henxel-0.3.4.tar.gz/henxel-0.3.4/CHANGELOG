search, replace:

Have to use marks to get overlapping searches work.

Can not replace/replace_all while "-overlap" in search_settings

if -start == 'insert' and search_word == selection_get:
	start search from sel_start
	done in do_search()


search ACA:
ACABACABA
ACA

can search with -overlap, if want to replace, use -regexp:
boundary == A
want change contents B:
B(?=A)

(also matches BBA etc, so must check first with search)

	tab_over_indent
###################

wordexpand now does expand from single letter at indent0
	also removed re-import
	# Get atrributes of 'self' faster. For example, if want: self.attribute1,
	# one writes any single letter, like 'a' and hits Tab, and gets 'self.'
	# Then add 'a' --> prevword is now 'self.a'. Now continue Tabbing:
	# --> self.attribute1 is now likely to appear soon.

#######################

undo_override, redo_override
#######################

ENABLE SUBSTITUTION WITH REGEXP


replace/all is now done with "tcl regsub" instead of "tk text replace"
--> Replacing with regexp, back references etc..


###
Example: If contents of tab is:
Example: 121 212

Example: 121 212

Example: 121 212


And there is "-regexp" in search_setting, And doing replace:

Then if search_word(old_word) would be:
"(\d+) (\d+)"
And if substitution(new_word) would be:
"\2 \1"

Result after replacing would then be:
Example: 212 121

Example: 212 121

Example: 212 121
###

###
Adding space to end of substitution:
	search_word + () ==empty string, if search_word is "A", then using
		A()
	with substitution, if want for example " BB "
		\0 BB \1
		
	where \0 is whole matched string and \1 is the empty string
	"&" can be used inplace of "\0"
	
	--> "A BB "

###


Adding to linestart: "^"
Adding to lineend: "$"
Concatenate lines: "\n+"
###

#######################

new state: 'goto_def'
	in goto_def(), when not already searching

removed tab_override()
# can_expand_word called before indent and unindent

# Reason is that before commit 5300449a75c4826
# when completing with Tab word1_word2 at word1:
# first, pressing Shift down to enter underscore '_'
# then fast pressing Tab after that.

# Now, Shift might still be pressed down
# --> get: word1_ and unindent line but no completion

# Want: indent, unindent one line (no selection) only when:
# cursor_index <= idx_linestart

# Solution
# Tab-completion also with Shift-Tab,
# which is intended to help tab-completing with slow/lazy fingers

		# Some object, that cleanup tried to delete,
		# did not yet had been created.
		#print(err)
	raise init_err
	
With this setup, no matter how editor was launched, if init fails,
there will not be any zombie editor window (root) leftovers.


when editor launch fails:
except Exception as init_err:
if not doing launch_test:
	give info about recovering: like help(henxel.stash_pop) etc
	

	
only debug mode is currently used in testlaunch to speed up testing

Less important changes End


# 0.3.2
- Fixed fontchooser, for example the animation should work again

- If uncomment fails, cursor should now keep original position

- 'focus'-tag is now underlined

- Some fixing in comment and uncomment like comment or uncomment curline
	without selection

- Search again backwards --> ctrl-shift-backspace,
	still back to previous with arrow left but it has some
	yet to be fixed issues likely to do something with check_sel

- Ctrl-Tab --> insert Tab

- Removed move _updownleftright() as unused and updated help

- When search, multilines (> 2 lines) are not autofilled as suggested search word

- Fix for: 'SyntaxWarning: invalid escape sequence' for one string in init.
	due to 'new' string escaping rules in python 3.12

- Caps-Lock state(if on) is now showed in btn_git
	It needed among other things bind to Motion to work

- There was issue: When search: after giving search word, then quickly pressing return and esc
	--> state of editor locked to search.
	This was fixed with checking if state is waiting in stop_search
	This kind of issues should be also checked on other escapable callbacks
	in the future.
		
- move_by_words and select_by_words now handle line ends better.

- Renamed copying and pasteing functions more clearly

- Copying now checks if user wants to copy a block and tries to keep
	its shape when doing paste. This is in 'alpha' -condition
	

# 0.3.1
- Keywords for syntax highlighting are now from: import keyword.

- 'sel'-tag has now second highest priority only below focus.

- Control-backspace to search again now works again.

- Word-expander works now as Tab-completion, its expands over dot attributes,
	like: self.at TAB --> self.attrib1, if self.attrib1 is already somewhere in contents.
	It is quite usable.

- Removed binding ctrl_L-super_L-return to run file in return_override().

- Ctrl-q -> Ctrl-Q for del_tab: prevent closing tab without saving by accident.

- Cmd-ae -> goto_linestart/end, when in macOS, this is quite usable.

- Also in macOS: Cmd-(Shift)-Up/Down -> move/select 10 lines up/down. Also usable.
	In Linux and Windows this is: Control-(Shift)-Up/Down and bind is to move_many_lines() instead
	of mac_cmd_overrides(). Not tested in Windows, but hopes are that the states are right.

- In return_override, if line is empty, rstrip to cursor to fix indent sailing if
	in middle of space.


- There were lot of issues with functions like select_by_words(), move_by_words() etc.
	which changed selection. First fix was like:
	self.contents.event_generate('<<SelectPrevWord>>')
	
	But it was flashy at lineends (because needed to adjust selection later),
	so ended up using <<PrevWord>> instead with:
	self.contents.mark_set(self.anchor, idx).
	
	It (that is: handling of selection changes) is now done right by setting
	selection-start-mark or -anchor with:
	self.contents.mark_set('tk::anchor1', '38.6').
	
	The name of anchor changes if editor is launched multiple times in one Python-session,
	so the current name is retrieved in init but there is still another problem:
	this anchor does not exist if certain event has not occured before.
	
	To get this working, the name of anchor is needed, it is done just before quite
	similar fix for Windows, and it is ugly.


- When doing search and replace one can now copy text and select and adjust selection
	with many functions like yank line, goto lineend etc.
	
	
- When doing search and replace:
	space 	--> exit to focus
	esc 	--> exit to start
	double-click --> exit to cursor
	
- When doing replace: One can continue replacing even if focus is not in contents.
	Replacement-string can now be changed in the middle of replacing.

- Status-messages of gotoline, search and replace are now in entry. This was done
	for increase fullscreen usability. Git branch-name remains in btn_git and
	tab-position remains in title.
	
- Editor is now aware if it is in fullscreen-mode. It is not used on anything.

- Editor now handles long strings better in entry, like filenames or searches.

- Small but important change in wait_for() to change state so that certain bindings
	do not trigger while waiting.

- Added two tkinter-books to dev/books.

- Added screenshots to README, and removed 'more on virtual environments' -section
	as potentially dangerous.

- Ctrl-q now quits with save when not in macOS, same way than cmd-q does in macOS.

- Updated helpfile

- Updated links to point to Tcl 9.0


# 0.3.0
- Fixed win_install_mkvenv
- Small fixes
- Ctrl-ju --> scroll downup without moving cursor, also at the end of the file.
- Walktabs is again alt-wq if not in macOS.


# 0.2.9
- Added win_install_mkvenv.py to /util which can be run in Windows with
	py win_install_mkvenv.py

Running it creates:
	create_scripts.bat
	launched.bat
	mkvenv.bat
	
in sys.prefix which hopefully is in the PATH.

Then one can do in Windows: mkvenv name_of_env.

That will install possible requirements also.
And mkvenv creates act.bat to root of venv that will activate venv.
And mkvenv creates launch_ed.bat to root of venv that will activate venv
and launch IDLE-shell and launch Henxel-editor if it is installed.
I no longer recommend installing pyreadline3 because it seems to not work
properly in Win10. Instead, using IDLE-shell has tab-completion and multiline
editing etc. Only that one can not change direction of prompt movement after
command execution. It now moves down and will eventually stay at the
bottom line. It would be preferable if prompt would move up instead,
and stay in the first line. One cannot clear screen in Windows so this is quite unfortunate.

- Small looks fixes.

- Alt -leftright now walks tabs in all OS-types. And Alt-wq closes editor
with save. This was done to increase cross-platform consistency in
shortcut-keys. It is also more easy to remember, maybe not so ideal though.

- Fixed move_by_words, select_by_words and yank_line for win10.


# 0.2.8
- Moved tcl-script, that fixes ctrl-rightleft behaviour for Windows, to better place.
So active tab should be safe now also in Windows.
- Tried 'lsappinfo metainfo' as a way to get terminal app name in macOS but it did not
work much faster so left as it was before: 'lsappinfo front' to get ASN and then
'lsappinfo info -only name'. Giving focus back to python terminal-window is not very
simple task in macOS. Currently tested with Terminal and iTerm2. It works quite ok now.
- OS-type is now determined as does IDLE-editor, copied it from there:

sys.platform == 'darwin'
sys.platform[:3] == 'win':
sys.platform.count('linux'):

This usage of module sys is nice addition, it was used very little before. Also now
there is no need to blindly try to find macOS terminal.
- Fix for: search_next would not work if holding ctrl down and repeatedly pressing backspace.
- Scrollbar is now little thinner if using macOS.
- Yank_line copies now whole line instead of just visible part of line.
- Added functions idx_linestart and -end to get effective indexes of the line.
- Added functions move_by_words and select_by_words which handles ctrl-leftright and
ctrl-shift-leftright behaviour in Linux and Windows and Alt-leftright and
Alt-shift-leftright behaviour in macOS. This was done to fix default handling of related
events near lineends.


# 0.2.7
- One can now yank line with ctrl- or cmd-y.
- Testing blockcursor -> normal cursor.
- Made padx and pady depend on font.measure instead of hardcoded values. Currently used only in contents and linenumbers.
- Clarified bindings after finding out that one can bind to Cmd with Mod1.
- Fixed goto_linestart -end etc. to make 'select line from' work.
- Not much else but wanted to release a little more working version.


# 0.2.6
- Added initial support for macOS. Tested to work in macOS 12. Had some major issues with it like
inability to bind. Also, focus it not restored to Python-console after closing editor, so some
trickery is made at import stage. You can find this in the beginning of class Editor.
Coloring with system theme (light/dark) is also difficult and
may require event-loop, if done with tkinter, or tracing in Tcl and is not yet done.
- Both command-w and -q closes editor with save. Cmd-left or right walks tabs. Cmd-n opens new tab
and cmd-return opens filedialog.
- When have selection in contents or entry, pressing arrow left or right
moves cursor to other end clearing selection.
- Ctrl-shift-a or -e does select from line, so does Cmd-shift-left or -right in macOS.
- Made macOS-helptext.
- Added copy of NotoMono v. 1.0 to /font for possible use in future.
- Some improvements in colorchooser.
- Noticed that macOS seems to have some momemtum in scrolling.
- Improvements in fontchoose, like made optionmenu choises bigger etc.
- Removed building part from 'More on virtual environments' -section of Readme.md
- TkDefaulFont is '.AppleSystemUIFont' in macOS and causes troubles
because it is not in font-families. We check for error at closing editor
and when choosing font.


# 0.2.5
- Added small Tcl-script in init to fix ctrl-(shift)-right-left no work in Windows11 with Tcl 8.6.12.
Changed it to the same as in Tcl 8.6.13 in Debian 12. 8.6.13-version uses word-chars in wordbreak regular
expressions where 8.6.12 uses space-chars. It explains some of the difference. Space chars RE were greedier
compared to word-char based ones, and thus they matched more. In normal text editing one would definitely
want to use space chars RE but this editor is for code editing.
- Center_view now shifts 1/3 screen height up per event.
- Because Viewsync-event does not trigger when window size changes, to get linenumbers updated,
added handle_configure() that is binded to <Configure>-event, which is generetad when window size changes.
-Being monospaced font does not guarantee same lineheight between lines not containing bold-text
and lines that do contain bold-text, like keywords. Courier for example is monospaced but does not have
this kind of constant lineheight. If choosing other than constant lineheight font, linenumbers
can have little offset. So Consolas is now before Courier in GOODFONTS. Because of this, made changes to
changefont.py: Added filters for mono- and constant height -fonts, also removed unnecessary options. Also
added missing call for tracefunc in checkbutton_command. Vertical fonts (those starting with @) are removed
from the list. Added info about filters.


# 0.2.4
- Canceled move_line binded with arrow left-right as it interfered with search_next.
- Canceled updown_override which expanded indenation on empty lines as confusing.
- Fixed editor not getting focus at launch in Windows.
- Fixed goto-linestart_end to work in error-view.
- Paste to Python-console works now also in Windows. This is why module threading is now imported and used in copy_windows(). Earlier paste freezed editor so it had to be fixed.
- Fixed copy-pasteing lines in place to work in windows as intented.


# 0.2.3
- Fix for: Editor not launching in Debian 12.
- Editor now launches in Windows, but freezes if trying paste to Python-console while editor is open and have to be closed, also move_line is not yet working.
- Indenting now works in Windows so do all shortcuts except for running file.
- Fix for:  bell after gotoline, replace, replace_all.
- Arrow-up and -down now expands indentation on empty line to same as in old line.
- No more saving TKDEFAULFONT as font-family in get_config.


# 0.2.2
- Much improved colorchooser, settings have now colors and is not compatible with older conf-files.
	Had to import copy-module for that which is to be removed in the future, when have colors-class.
- Again many fixes in replace.
- You can now center view with Ctrl-j.
- Improved checkpars alot. Curls are also counted.
- Disabled some default Text-widget-class-bindings like Ctrl-arrow: move 'one paragraph'
	to somewhere etc.


# 0.2.1
- Fixed multiline parentheses check.
- Fixed replace, self.replace_overlap_index is still needed.
	Replaced are now showed until esc, showed also if doing search again.
	You can now replace by pressing Return only.
	
- Ctrl-d in last tab, which has no filepath, clears contents.
- Ctrl-a is now: goto linestart as is the default. Select all, if needed,
	can be found from mouse-menu.
	
- Removed tabify from mouse-menu as not needed, and binded Control-t to it.
- Goto linestart now skips indentation.
- When Un-,Indenting or pasting many lines, first line is shown.
	Also you can now fix that first line indentation with arrow left and right
	while indenting many lines.
	
- Made waiter-func to add delay while doing things which involve view-changes like
	unindent many lines or searching.
	
- Fix for: view-change to a file with cursor on start of multiline string.
- Added missing docstring to wordexpand.py
- Updated help.


# 0.2.0
- It is now possible to close tab without saving it with: ctrl-q
- Added missing unbind for buttonrelease-1 when replacing.
- Added initial word-expander from idle/autoexpand.py, renamed it wordexpand.py,
	binded to Alt-e and updated help-text.
- Also removed overlap-index stuff from replace and use now 'replaced'-tag instead
	to mark already replaced areas.


# 0.1.9
- After save (give filename), put focus on text.
- Pasting to tab with no filename does no longer trigger syntax highlighting.
- Unindenting single line works now as it should.
- Updated help-text.
- Added initial checking for parenthesis mismatch.
- Fix error raised in v.0.1.8, when walking to newtab.
- When searching, ensure_visibility shows now 4 next lines instead of just 2.
- When deleting selection, an extra character before selection was also deleted. This is now fixed.


# 0.1.8
- Fix error-view syntax-highlighting.
- Fix error when doing ctrl-s if cursor not visible.
- Colorchooser now shows current color correctly.
- Updated help-file.
- Fixes for show_next, ensure_visibility, walk_tabs.
- Fixes for paste() when dealing with multiline string markers.


# 0.1.7
- Added bunch of files from idlelib to be used as example resource in the future.
	https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/3.11/Lib/idlelib/
- Small fixes.


# 0.1.6
- Quick fix for check_indent_depth()


# 0.1.5
- From CHANGELOG.md to CHANGELOG.
- Add version number to help.
- Fix syntax-highlight like: calls
- Small fixes.
- You can now change indentation depth with: .change_indentation_width()
- Indentation depth is saved in configuration.
- Indentation depth is now checked before opening files.


# 0.1.4
- Updating whole-files syntax is now much faster like when walking tabs etc. It is done by calling update_tokens directly, without waiting for sync-event. Sync-event is still used to detect changes and syntax-highlighting is now much ahead last version.
- Only replace_all leaves tags on now, after searching.


# 0.1.3
- Unified tokenfuncs.
- Added syntax-option to conf.
- Tab is syntax-highlighted when it has/gets py-filename.
- Added shortcut for run-file: Ctrl-Super-Return. Super means search-key.
- Alt-x toggles syntax.
- Fixed syntax-highlighting to handle multiline strings etc.
- Replace all is now much faster and so is show_next and prev.
- Error-view has also syntax.
- Because Alt-n after replacing is bad, dont want to open new tab, but also
want Alt-n-Return, so now: ctrl-n is show_next and ctrl-p show_prev when searching.


# 0.1.2
- Add initial syntax highlight for python-files.
- Fixed tabify to correctly strip all tabs on disk save.
- Add tabify region-utility to popup-menu.
- Search now leaves tags on. Double-Esc clears.
- It is now possible to go back to last cursor position with arrow left
when doing seach_next if have gone too far.
- changefont.py now takes optional tracefunc as kw-argument to perform whatever action is needed
on font changes.
- changes on shortcuts:
- ctrl-p --> alt-f,  ctrl-s --> alt-s,  ctrl-n --> alt-n
- ctrl-o  insert linebreak
- ctrl-i  move right
- ctrl-b  move left
- ctrl-e  move to line end
- ctrl-s  move to line end
- ctrl-k  remove from cursor to lineend


# 0.1.1
- Quick fix for: wrong bind in font_choose
- And for: __new__ should not alter existing object types


# 0.1.0
- Files can again be opened from entry.
- Improvements for fdialog.Fdialog like show current directory.
- File loading is no more blocking but more like fontchoose, using tracevar.
- If current git-branch is main or master it is shown with red color.
- No more multiple fontchoose-, colorchoose- or filedialogs or editors.
- Binding for fontchoose: ctrl-p moved from self to contents reason being
the same as usual, it has default binding in Text()-widget which moves
cursor line up. Which is actually pretty good choice, also that ctrl-n for down.
But I need those and I can scroll.
- Widgets are now disabled when filedialog is open.
- changefont.FontChooser no longer initiates its toplevel-window, and font names are taken from font-instances name-attribute rather than using dummy-names.
- etc. small fixes


# 0.0.9
- Fix for: being able modify contents at the beginning of search.
- Cursor pos is again set after editor launch
- Clarified some varnames: like tag 'found' to 'focus'
- Dumped tkinter.filedialog.FileDialog. Instead use now fdialog.FDialog
- Tested setting cursor blink off when idle but it added too much overhead, so left as is.
	(Had to bind to: Button, KeyRelease, FocusIn and it seemed to be too much.)


# 0.0.8
- Reorder grid-related stuff in init to make instantiation of editor feel more instant.
- You can now toggle linenumbers with Alt-l (as lemon). This adds a new option to conf meaning this version is not compatible with earlier ones.
- Adjusted colors and borders for filedialog.Filedialog used in load().
- Made small fix to no_copy_ln(). If encounter problem with copying from editor to shell or console, try
first to copy something from shell or console to editor and retry. I have not had this issue for some time now.
- Added inspect-option to popup-menu, and updated help-file for how to use it.


# 0.0.7
- Fix for: goodfonts were left commented and removed badfonts as unused.
- Removed tkinter.scrolledtext -module as unused.
- Added info how to inspect objects in help. Was thinking implementing, but I changed my mind.
- Added a section about venvs for more advanced programmers in README.


# 0.0.6
- Trailing whitespace of non-empty lines is now stripped away in tabify() when saving files to disk.
- Control-f is now binded to Text-widget instead of Toplevel. Reason is again to avoid default binding.
	It seems to center to cursor by default.
- After doing long paste, more lines than in screen, cursor was out of screen. Now view is refreshed after
	paste.
- When doing search or replace, clipboard contents is now autofilled to entry in most situations. Yes, I got
	idea from Gnome editor, which by the way has some issue showing the last lines sometimes, this is bad,
	I have always showed the lines, keeping them untouched is another story.
- Finally got rid of module random. Fonts are now initiated with family='TkDefaulFont'.
- Some renaming etc. in linenumbers.
- Linenumber update is now handled by built-in event: <<'WidgetViewSync'>>  which is great news:
	got rid of quite complex self-handled event-loop. It was working alright but this approach is simpler
	and more responsive. Im keeping copy of version 0.0.5 in dev/oldversions so it can be used as a reference. Install it with pip install oldversion.tar.gz.
	About event <<'WidgetViewSync'>> :
	It is generated when doing: insert, delete or screen geometry change. Also on almost all font-changes but
	not when scrolling, so this is the reason why update_linenums is called also from sbset_override.
	This really made a difference. It is now child-play to do things like toggle-linenums etc.
- Started replacing usage of % in strings with f-strings. Now all calls to print() are %-free. Still ~150 replacements left.


# 0.0.5
- Small fix in getLineNumbers()
- Added borders etc.
- You can now walk back with: alt-q
- File open -dialog width is increased
- Close open dialogs when quitting, tk_chooseColor is problematic though
	(it might have own temporary root)
- Dumped 'proxy-undo',  reason being lag-increase, files are in /dev if interested
- If get motivation to continue with undo, I will go with ungrid, also in /dev


# 0.0.4
- Made decision not to try to do tab-specific undo, for reasons you can read in dev/todo.py
- Undo should no longer clear contents.
- Pasting from editor to console works again.
- Changed title of file selection dialog --> select file
- Changed title of editor: 3/5 --> 00@00
- Added dev-dir to repo and some may be useful -files there
- Updated mkvenv in readme
