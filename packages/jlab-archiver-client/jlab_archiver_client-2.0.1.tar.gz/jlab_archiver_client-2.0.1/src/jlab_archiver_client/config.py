"""Configuration management for the jlab_archiver_client package.

This module provides a thread-safe configuration singleton for managing connection
settings and endpoint paths for the Jefferson Lab Archiver myquery server. The
configuration can be modified at runtime and supports safe concurrent access from
multiple threads.

The configuration uses a singleton pattern to ensure that all parts of the application
share the same configuration state. The 'from' import pattern is supported through
a mutate-in-place API, so imported references never go stale.

Key Features:
    * Thread-safe configuration updates and reads
    * Singleton pattern for global configuration state
    * Support for multiple myquery endpoints (mysampler, interval, channel, point, mystats)
    * Runtime configuration changes without restart
    * Consistent snapshots for atomic reads

Attributes:
    config (_Config): The global configuration singleton instance.

Example::

    >>> from jlab_archiver_client.config import config
    >>> # Configure for local development server
    >>> config.set(myquery_server="localhost:8080", protocol="http")
    >>>
    >>> # Configure for production server
    >>> config.set(myquery_server="epicsweb.jlab.org", protocol="https")
    >>>
    >>> # Get a consistent snapshot of current configuration
    >>> current_config = config.snapshot()
    >>> print(current_config['myquery_server'])
    epicsweb.jlab.org
