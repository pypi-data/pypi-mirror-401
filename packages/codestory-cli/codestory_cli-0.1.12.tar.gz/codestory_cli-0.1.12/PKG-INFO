Summary: Every project should have a good story behind it. With a good story (git history), you can reason about changes in a way that would be impossible just looking at a codebase. But let us do the work in creating that story

The Codestory CLI is a high level interface over git. Why?
Git is a powerful tool. It is also an excellent tool for shooting yourself in the foot.

While Git provides the infrastructure for version control, you rarely need to be down in the pipes for daily work. Codestory lets you do 99% of regular tasks much more effectively. When you need Git, its always there for those more complex tasks. It does not replace Git; it allows you to use it effectively without the headache.

Codestory provides powerful commands to enhance your version control workflow: commit changes into small, logical commits with AI-generated messages; fix past commits by intelligently splitting them into more focused changes; clean entire repository histories to improve commit quality; and configure settings to tailor the tool to your needs.

Think of this as a natural transition to a higher-level version control, where you can worry less about housekeeping and focus on building.
