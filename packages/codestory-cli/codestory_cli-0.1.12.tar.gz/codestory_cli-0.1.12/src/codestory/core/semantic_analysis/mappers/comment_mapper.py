"""Comment mapping utilities.

Builds a map of which lines (0-indexed) in a source file are pure
comment lines meaning the only non-whitespace characters on that line
belong to one or more comment captures returned by Treesitter. Inline
comments that follow code on the same line are excluded. Multi-line
comment nodes are handled by splitting their covered span per line.
