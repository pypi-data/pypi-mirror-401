# starobj

Table-based storage for BMRB's NMR-STAR 3.x.

*This code is tied to BMRB's NMR-STAR data model and dictionary and is probably of limited
utility to users outside of BMRB. You have been warned.*

The tables are relational, `sqlite3` and PostgreSQL (`psycopg2` with a bit of editing) 
are supported.

The code is pure python, main components are

* database loader (`parser.py`),
* pretty printer (`unparser.py`),
* NMR-STAR data access classes (`entry.py` and `startable.py`)
* NMR-STAR dictionary wrapper (`stardict.py`)
* and a poor man's DB abstraction layer (`db.py`)

## NMR-STAR relational mappings

The format of NMR-STAR 3 (and PDB's mmCIF) tag names is `_`**`table`**`.`**`column`**, that is: underscore -
table name (aka tag category) - dot - column name (aka tag name). The mapping from NMR-STAR/mmCIF to relational 
tables is straightforward except for the gotchas:

* Because some of the names are SQL reserved words, this library double-quotes them all and makes 
them case-sensitive as a side-effect.

* NMR-STAR uses "saveframe" block and has several special tags and rules to maintain saveframe information
in the relational tables:

  * `Sf_framecode` tags contain the name of the parent saveframe (saveframe names must be unique within
    the entry),
  * `Sf_category` tags contain the category, or type, of the enclosing saveframe,
  * "local ID" tags, typically named `ID`, contain the number of the saveframe of a 
    given type within the entry. The `(Sf_category, ID)` tuple must be unique within 
    the entry.
  * `Entry_ID` tags contain entry ID. `(Entry_ID, Sf_category, ID)` is the databse-global 
    unique key for the saveframe. Every data table in the saveframe has a corresponding 
    foreign key tuple that links it to its saveframe.
  * Last but not least, there is a convenience key: `Sf_ID` that is autoincremented insteger, 
    unique per saveframe accross the entire database with multiple entries. It is 
    regenerated on database reload, `Sf_ID` tags never appear in the NMR-STAR files.

This code creates one additiona table (see `parser.py`): 
```
entry_saverames (category text, entryid text, sfid integer, name text, line integer)
```
It is needed to keep track of various housekeeping info, e.g. line numbers 
for error reporting, auto-generated `sfid` primary keys, etc.

## Usage

See `test` subdirectory for code examples.

**Required**:

BMRB SAS parser and an NMR-STAR dictionary. They are both on GitHub, but the sqlite3 
database version of the dictionary is not. Contact us for the latest and greatest.

PyGreSQL (although it can be trivially changed to `psycopg2`, see `db.py`), v.5 recommended.
