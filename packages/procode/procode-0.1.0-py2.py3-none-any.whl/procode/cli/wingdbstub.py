"""wingdbstub.py -- Start debugging Python programs from outside of Wing

Copyright (c) 1999-2018, Archaeopteryx Software, Inc.  All rights reserved.

Written by Stephan R.A. Deibel and John P. Ehresman

Usage:
---------

This file is used to initiate debug in Python code without launching
that code from Wing.  To use it, edit the configuration values below,
start Wing and configure it to listen for outside debug connections,
and then add the following line to your code:

  import wingdbstub

Debugging will start immediately after this import statement is reached.

For details, see Debugging Externally Launched Code in the manual.

# stored in wingdebugpw in the Settings Directory shown in Wing's About
# box is used by both ends of the connection.  In other cases, Wing will
# wrote a new security token to the Settings Directory for the user running
# the debug process.  An unknown security token will be rejected, but Wing
# will offer to accept future connections using an that token.  To avoid
# this, copy the file wingdebugpw from the Settings Directory shown in Wing's
# About box to the same directory as this copy of wingdbstub.py, or set
# kSecurityToken below to the contents of that file.  This is also needed
# when Wing cannot write to the Settings Directory, or the contents of that
# directory are not persisted between debug runs, as is the case with some
# types of containers.

# The security token to use, overriding any other value.  If None, the token is
# instead read from the file configured with kFWFilePath and kPWFileName below.
