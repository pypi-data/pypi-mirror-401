**Description**

`assetic` is an SDK wrapper for the Assetic REST APIs

**Installation (recommended)**

To install assetic run:

    pip install assetic

**Manual Installation**

Can be manually but dependencies will also require installing
Can optionally use a zip file available from Assetic if pip cannot be used

**Quick Start**

Once you have installed everything, include the following in your python script:
	import assetic

	#create an instance and authenticate

	asseticsdk = assetic.asseticSDK()

From there you can use the APIs:

    assetapi = assetic.AssetApi()
	assetapi.getassets()
