# Angry Metal Guy Player

Angry Metal Guy Player (AMG Player) is a Python multi platform console tool to automatically play or download tracks from [Angry Metal Guy](https://www.angrymetalguy.com/) reviews.

I created this because:

- I like Angry Metal Guy, and discovered great music (both metal and totally non-metal) thanks to their reviews
- I often disagree with their ratings (in fact I disagree more often than I agree), both for overrating and underrating
- Even when I disagree, I like reading their reviews
- I want to listen to the music **before** I read the review, to avoid getting influenced
- To be efficient, I want to listen to the tracks like a radio, and read the review to learn more only when I like something

## Features

- Can work either in interactive mode (manually select tracks) or totally automatic (play new tracks like a radio)
- Supports embedded tracks from: YouTube, Bandcamp, SoundCloud, ReverbNation
- Plays YouTube video if available, or generates a video on the fly with the cover image + audio track(s) (requires FFmpeg)
- Can download tracks (with embedded album art) to play later
