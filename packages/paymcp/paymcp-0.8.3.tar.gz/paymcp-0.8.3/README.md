# PayMCP

**Provider-agnostic payment layer for MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools and agents.**

> 🆕 **x402 protocol is now fully supported.** PayMCP includes native support for the [x402 payment protocol](https://www.x402.org/) and a dedicated `Mode.X402` for clients capable of automatic on-chain payments.

`paymcp` is a lightweight SDK that helps you add monetization to your MCP‑based tools, servers, or agents. It supports multiple payment providers and integrates seamlessly with MCP's tool/resource interface.

## 🔧 Features

- ✅ Add `@price(...)` decorators to your MCP tools to enable pay‑per‑request billing.
- ✅ Gate tools behind **active subscriptions** (where supported) with the `@subscription(...)` decorator; helper tools included.
- 🔁 Pay‑per‑request flows support multiple **modes** (AUTO / X402 / TWO_STEP / RESUBMIT / ELICITATION / PROGRESS / DYNAMIC_TOOLS).
- 🔌 Built-in support for major providers ([see list](#supported-providers)) — plus a pluggable interface for custom providers.
- ⚙️ Easy integration with `FastMCP` or other MCP servers


## 🚀 Quickstart

Install the SDK from PyPI:
```bash
pip install mcp paymcp
```

Initialize `PayMCP`:

```python
import os
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP, Context
from paymcp import Mode, price
from paymcp.providers import StripeProvider

mcp = FastMCP("AI agent name")

PayMCP(
    mcp,
    providers=[
        StripeProvider(api_key=os.getenv("STRIPE_API_KEY")),
    ],
    mode=Mode.AUTO # optional, AUTO (default) / X402 / TWO_STEP / RESUBMIT / ELICITATION / PROGRESS / DYNAMIC_TOOLS
)

```

> 💡 **Tip:** In `Mode.AUTO`, you can configure both a traditional provider (e.g. Stripe) and an X402 provider.
> If the client has an X402 wallet, PayMCP will automatically use the x402 protocol; otherwise, it falls back to the traditional provider.

Use the `@price` decorator on any tool:

```python
@mcp.tool()
@price(amount=0.99, currency="USD")
def add(a: int, b: int, ctx: Context) -> int: # `ctx` is required by the PayMCP tool signature — include it even if unused
    """Adds two numbers and returns the result."""
    return a + b
```

> **Demo MCP servers:**
> - Pay‑per‑request example: [python-paymcp-server-demo](https://github.com/blustAI/python-paymcp-server-demo)
> - Subscription example: [paymcp-subscription-demo-py](https://github.com/PayMCP/paymcp-subscription-demo-py)


## 💰 Choose How to Charge (per tool)

Use **either** `@price` or `@subscription` on a tool (they are mutually exclusive).

### Option A — Pay‑per‑request

```python
@mcp.tool()
@price(amount=0.19, currency="USD")
def summarize(text: str, ctx: Context) -> str:
    return text[:200]
```

### Option B — Subscription‑gated (providers with subscription support, e.g., Stripe)

User authentication is **your** responsibility. PayMCP will resolve identity from `ctx.authInfo` **or** a Bearer token (Authorization header). Make sure your token carries:
- `sub` (treated as `userId`), and ideally
- `email` (highly recommended for provider matching, e.g., Stripe).

PayMCP does **not** validate or verify the token; it only parses it to extract `userId`/`email`.

```python
from paymcp import subscription

@mcp.tool()
@subscription(plan="price_pro_monthly")  # or a list of accepted plan IDs from your provider
async def generate_report(ctx: Context) -> str:
    return "Your report"
```

When you register the first subscription‑protected tool, PayMCP auto‑registers helper tools:

- `list_subscriptions` — current subscriptions + available plans for the user.
- `start_subscription` — accepts `planId` to create (or resume) a subscription.
- `cancel_subscription` — accepts `subscriptionId` to cancel at period end.

## 🔌 Writing a Custom Provider

Any provider must subclass `BasePaymentProvider` and implement `create_payment(...)` and `get_payment_status(...)`.

```python
from paymcp.providers import BasePaymentProvider

class MyProvider(BasePaymentProvider):

    def create_payment(self, amount: float, currency: str, description: str):
        # Return (payment_id, payment_url)
        return "unique-payment-id", "https://example.com/pay"

    def get_payment_status(self, payment_id: str) -> str:
        return "paid"

PayMCP(mcp, providers=[MyProvider(api_key="...")])
```

---

## 🗄️ State Storage 

By default, PayMCP stores payment_id and pending tool arguments **in memory** using a process-local `Map`. This is **not durable** and will not work across server restarts or multiple server instances (no horizontal scaling).

To enable durable and scalable state storage, you can provide a custom `StateStore` implementation. PayMCP includes a built-in `RedisStateStore`, which works with any Redis-compatible client.

```python
from redis.asyncio import from_url
from paymcp import PayMCP, RedisStateStore

redis = await from_url("redis://localhost:6379")
PayMCP(
    mcp,
    providers=[
        StripeProvider(api_key=os.getenv("STRIPE_API_KEY")),
    ],
    state_store=RedisStateStore(redis)
)
```

## 🧭 Modes (pay‑per‑request only)

In version 0.4.2, `paymentFlow` was renamed to `mode` (old name still works).

The `mode` parameter controls how the user is guided through the pay‑per‑request payment process. Pick what fits your client:

- **`Mode.AUTO`** (default) — Detects client capabilities and automatically selects the payment provider.
  If both a traditional provider and an X402 provider are configured, PayMCP uses x402 when the client supports it, and falls back to the traditional provider otherwise.
- **`Mode.TWO_STEP`** — Splits the tool into two MCP methods. First call returns `payment_url` + `next_step`; the confirm method verifies and runs the original logic. Works in most clients.
- **`Mode.RESUBMIT`** — Adds optional `payment_id` to the tool signature. First call returns `payment_url` + `payment_id`; second call with `payment_id` verifies then runs the tool. Similar compatibility to TWO_STEP.
- **`Mode.ELICITATION`** — Sends a payment link via MCP elicitation (if supported). After payment, the tool completes in the same call.
- **`Mode.PROGRESS`** — Keeps the call open, streams progress while polling the provider, and returns automatically once paid.
- **`Mode.DYNAMIC_TOOLS`** — Temporarily exposes additional tools (e.g., `confirm_payment_*`) to steer the client/LLM through the flow.
- **`Mode.X402`** — Uses the [x402 protocol](https://www.x402.org/) for automatic on‑chain payments. Clients receive an MCP error with HTTP status `402 Payment Required` formatted per x402, and can auto‑pay and retry without user interaction.

⚠️ **Important limitations**:

- `Mode.X402` can be used **only if you are certain the MCP client supports automatic payments via x402**.
- **Most major MCP clients do NOT currently support x402.**
- If client support is uncertain, **use `Mode.AUTO` instead** — it will safely fall back to other compatible flows.

**Supported assets (current x402 protocol):**
- **USDC on Base**
- **USDC on Solana** (often referred to as **USDC‑SPL**)

To accept payments in `Mode.X402`, you **must** use the `X402Provider`.

#### X402 Provider Configuration

Minimal setup for accepting **USDC payments** using x402:

```python
import os
from paymcp.providers import X402Provider

provider = X402Provider(
    pay_to=[{"address": "0xYourAddress"}]
)
```

For **development and testing**, use Base Sepolia testnet:

```python
provider = X402Provider(
    pay_to=[{
        "address": "0xYourAddress",
        "network": "eip155:84532",  # Base Sepolia testnet
    }]
)
```

`eip155:84532` is the **CAIP‑2 network identifier** for the Base Sepolia testnet.

You can configure **multiple `pay_to` entries** to enable **multi‑network or multi‑asset acceptance** within the same provider instance.

> ⚠️ **Note:** `Mode.X402` works only with MCP clients that explicitly support the x402 payment protocol. Since most existing clients do not, it is strongly recommended to use `Mode.AUTO` unless you fully control the client environment.

## 🔒 Security Notice

PayMCP is NOT compatible with STDIO mode deployments where end users download and run MCP servers locally. This would expose your payment provider API keys to end users, creating serious security vulnerabilities.
