The GDAPS library allows Django to make real "pluggable" apps.

A standard Django "app" is *reusable* (if done correctly), but is not *pluggable*,
like being distributed and "plugged" into a Django main application without modifications. GDAPS is filling this gap.

The reason you want to use GDAPS is: **you want to create an application that should be extended via plugins**. GDAPS consists of a few bells and twistles where Django lacks "automagic":

* Apps are automatically found using setuptools' entry points
* Apps can provide their own URLs (they are included and merged into urlpatterns automatically)
* Apps can define ``Interfaces``, that other GDAPS apps then can implement
* Apps can provide template hooks that can be filled with plugins' content


## Limitations

* GDAPS interfaces cannot inherit classes that import models (like `PermissionRequiredMixin`), as the declaration is too early in the Django setup process, and apps aren't loaded at that time.


## Contribute
