"""
Baseline receiver for MIMO-OFDM neural receiver demo.

Implements a conventional receiver chain that serves as the
performance baseline for comparison against the neural receiver:

    Channel Estimation -> LMMSE Equalization -> Soft Demapping -> LDPC Decoding

The receiver supports two CSI modes:

1. **Perfect CSI** (``cfg.perfect_csi=True``): Uses ground-truth channel
   coefficients from the CSI object. Establishes an upper bound on achievable
   performance with ideal channel knowledge.

2. **Estimated CSI** (``cfg.perfect_csi=False``): Uses LS channel estimation
   from pilot symbols with nearest-neighbor interpolation. Represents realistic
   receiver performance with practical channel estimation.

This baseline receiver is used during inference to compare BER/BLER against
the neural receiver, demonstrating the gains from learned signal processing.

    """
    Conventional MIMO-OFDM receiver with LS estimation and LMMSE equalization.

    Implements the standard receive processing chain used as a baseline for
    neural receiver comparison. The chain consists of:

    1. **Channel Estimation**: LS estimation at pilot positions with
       nearest-neighbor interpolation to data positions.

    2. **LMMSE Equalization**: Linear minimum mean square error spatial
       filtering to separate MIMO streams.

    3. **Soft Demapping**: APP (a posteriori probability) demapper producing
       soft LLR values for each coded bit.

    4. **LDPC Decoding**: 5G NR LDPC decoder producing hard bit decisions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    cfg : ~demos.mimo_ofdm_neural_receiver.src.config.Config
        Configuration object containing modulation, coding, and CSI settings.

    csi : CSI
        Channel state information object providing ground-truth channel
        coefficients for perfect-CSI mode.

    Attributes
    ----------
    _cfg : ~demos.mimo_ofdm_neural_receiver.src.config.Config
        Reference to configuration object.

    _csi : CSI
        Reference to CSI object for perfect-CSI path.

    Note
    ----
    The receiver shares the ``CSI`` instance with the transmit chain to ensure
    the same channel realization is used for both transmission and perfect-CSI
    reception. This is critical for fair performance evaluation.

    Example
    -------
    >>> cfg = Config(perfect_csi=False)
    >>> csi = CSI(cfg)
    >>> rx = Rx(cfg, csi)
    >>> out = rx(y, h_freq, no)
    >>> decoded_bits = out["b_hat"]

        Dict[str, tf.Tensor]
            Dictionary containing intermediate and final outputs:

        Pre-conditions
        --------------
        - ``y`` must contain valid received samples including pilot positions.
        - ``no`` must be positive (zero causes division issues in LMMSE).

        Post-conditions
        ---------------
        - ``h_hat`` contains channel estimates on data subcarriers only
          (guard bands and pilots removed).
        - ``b_hat`` contains hard binary decisions in {0, 1}.
        - All intermediate tensors are available for analysis/debugging.

        Note

        The perfect-CSI path uses ``csi.remove_nulled_scs`` to extract channel
        coefficients on active subcarriers, matching the format expected by
        the LMMSE equalizer. The error variance is set to zero since there
        is no estimation error with perfect knowledge.
