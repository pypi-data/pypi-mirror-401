"""
Memory polynomial power amplifier model for DPD system simulation.

Implements a PA behavioral model based on measured coefficients
from a WARP (Wireless Open-Access Research Platform) board. The memory
polynomial structure captures both static nonlinearity (AM/AM, AM/PM)
and dynamic memory effects that arise from thermal and electrical time
constants.

The model is implemented as a differentiable Keras layer, enabling gradient-based
DPD training where the PA acts as a fixed (non-trainable) component in the
signal path.

    """
    Memory polynomial power amplifier model.

    Implements a memory polynomial (MP) PA model with fixed coefficients
    derived from WARP board measurements. The model captures amplitude-
    dependent gain compression (AM/AM) and phase distortion (AM/PM),
    as well as memory effects from previous samples.

    The PA transfer function is:

    .. math::

        y[n] = \\sum_{k \\in \\{1,3,5,7\\}} \\sum_{m=0}^{3} a_{k,m} \\cdot x[n-m] \\cdot |x[n-m]|^{k-1}

    where :math:`a_{k,m}` are complex coefficients, :math:`k` is the polynomial
    order (odd-only to model symmetric nonlinearity), and :math:`m` is the
    memory tap index.

    Parameters
    ----------
    **kwargs
        Additional keyword arguments passed to the Keras Layer base class.

    Notes
    -----
    **miscellaneous:**

    - Input signal should be normalized to appropriate power level
      (the model expects inputs with RMS around 0.1-1.0)
    - Output has same shape as input
    - Output exhibits AM/AM compression and AM/PM distortion

    Example
    -------
    >>> pa = PowerAmplifier()
    >>> x = tf.complex(tf.random.normal([16, 1024]), tf.random.normal([16, 1024]))
    >>> x = x * 0.3  # Scale to reasonable PA input level
    >>> y = pa(x)
    >>> y.shape

        Estimate small-signal (linear) gain of the PA.

        Uses a low-amplitude test signal to measure gain in the linear region
        where higher-order polynomial terms are negligible. This gain value
        is needed for proper normalization in the indirect learning DPD
        architecture.

        Parameters
        ----------
        num_samples : int
            Number of random samples for gain estimation. More samples
            reduce variance. Defaults to 10000.

        Returns
        -------
        tf.Tensor
            Estimated voltage gain (linear scale, not dB). Typically close

        Notes
        -----
        **Why estimate gain?**

        In indirect learning DPD, the PA output is divided by the gain G
        before being fed to the postdistorter. Without this normalization,
        the postdistorter would learn to invert both the PA nonlinearity
        AND its linear gain, which is undesirable.

        **Why low amplitude?**

        At low input amplitudes, the PA operates linearly and higher-order
        terms (``|x|^2``, ``|x|^4``, etc.) become negligible. The measured gain
        then reflects only the first-order (linear) coefficient.
