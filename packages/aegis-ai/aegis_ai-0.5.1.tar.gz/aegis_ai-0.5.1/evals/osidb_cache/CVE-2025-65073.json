    "impact": "IMPORTANT",
    "title": "OpenStack Keystone: Unauthorized access and privilege escalation via AWS signature validation flaw",
    "statement": "This vulnerability allows an attacker to obtain a valid OpenStack's Keystone token belonging to a valid user by sending a valid AWS signature to the /v3/ec2tokens or /v3/s3tokens API's endpoints, leading to access to unauthorized resources or privilege escalation within the OpenStack instance.\n\nThis attack is considered to have a high complexity (AC:H) due to the fact of obtaining such valid AWS token is not straight forward. To be considered vulnerable, the OpenStack deployments should expose the related API end points through a public API or external access.",
    "mitigation": "Red Hat has investigated whether a possible mitigation exists for this issue, and has not been able to identify a practical example. Please update the affected package as soon as possible.",
    "comment_zero": "OpenStack Keystone before 26.0.1, 27.0.0, and 28.0.0 allows a /v3/ec2tokens or /v3/s3tokens request with a valid AWS Signature to provide Keystone authorization.",
