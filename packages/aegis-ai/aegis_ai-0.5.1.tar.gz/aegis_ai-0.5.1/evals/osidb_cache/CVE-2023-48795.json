    "cwe_id": "CWE-222",
    "impact": "MODERATE",
    "title": "Prefix truncation attack on Binary Packet Protocol (BPP)",
    "statement": "This CVE is classified as moderate because the attack requires an active Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) who can intercept and modify the connection's traffic at the TCP/IP layer.\n\nAlthough the attack is cryptographically innovative, its security impact is fortunately quite limited. It only allows the deletion of consecutive messages, and deleting most messages at this protocol stage prevents user authentication from proceeding, leading to a stalled connection.\n\nThe most significant identified impact is that it enables a MITM to delete the SSH2_MSG_EXT_INFO message sent before authentication begins. This allows the attacker to disable a subset of keystroke timing obfuscation features. However, there is no other observable impact on session secrecy or session integrity.",
    "mitigation": "Update to the last version and check that client and server provide kex pseudo-algorithms indicating usage of the updated version of the protocol which is protected from the attack. If \"kex-strict-c-v00@openssh.com\" is provided by clients and \"kex-strict-s-v00@openssh.com\" is in the server's reply, no other steps are necessary.\n\nDisabling ciphers if necessary:\n\nIf \"kex-strict-c-v00@openssh.com\" is not provided by clients or \"kex-strict-s-v00@openssh.com\" is absent in the server's reply, you can disable the following ciphers and HMACs as a workaround on RHEL-8 and RHEL-9:\n\n1. chacha20-poly1305@openssh.com\n2. hmac-sha2-512-etm@openssh.com\n3. hmac-sha2-256-etm@openssh.com\n4. hmac-sha1-etm@openssh.com\n5. hmac-md5-etm@openssh.com\n\nTo do that through crypto-policies, one can apply a subpolicy with the following content:\n```\ncipher@SSH = -CHACHA20-POLY1305\nssh_etm = 0\n```\ne.g., by putting these lines into `/etc/crypto-policies/policies/modules/CVE-2023-48795.pmod`, applying the resulting subpolicy with `update-crypto-policies --set $(update-crypto-policies --show):CVE-2023-48795` and restarting openssh server.\n\nOne can verify that the changes are in effect by ensuring the ciphers listed above are missing from both `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/openssh.config` and `/etc/crypto-policies/back-ends/opensshserver.config`.\n\nFor more details on using crypto-policies, please refer to https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/9/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening\n\nNote that this procedure does limit the interoperability of the host and is only suggested as a temporary mitigation until the issue is fully resolved with an update.\n\nFor RHEL-7: \nWe can recommend to use strict MACs and Ciphers on RHEL7 in both files /etc/ssh/ssh_config and /etc/ssh/sshd_config.\n\nBelow strict set of Ciphers and MACs can be used as mitigation for RHEL 7.\n\n```\nCiphers aes128-ctr,aes192-ctr,aes256-ctr,aes128-gcm@openssh.com,aes256-gcm@openssh.com\nMACs umac-64@openssh.com,umac-128@openssh.com,hmac-sha2-256,hmac-sha2-512\n```\n\n- For Openshift Container Platform 4:\nPlease refer the KCS[1] document for verifying the fix in RHCOS.\n\n[1] https://access.redhat.com/solutions/7071748",
