    "title": "CVE-2025-12735",
    "statement": "Although expr-eval is listed as a bundled dependency in grafana-pcp in RHEL 8, the library is not present in the compiled JavaScript bundle and the vulnerable code does not execute.",
    "comment_zero": "The expr-eval library is a JavaScript expression parser and evaluator designed to safely evaluate mathematical expressions with user-defined variables. However, due to insufficient input validation, an attacker can pass a crafted variables object into the evaluate() function and trigger arbitrary code execution.",
    "comments": "",
    "description": "A vulnerability was discovered in the expr-eval npm package, a JavaScript library used to parse and evaluate mathematical expressions. The issue allows an attacker to define arbitrary functions within the context object used by the parser's evaluate() method. By providing maliciously crafted input, an attacker can exploit this flaw to inject and execute arbitrary system-level commands on the host system. This could lead to the execution of malicious code.",
