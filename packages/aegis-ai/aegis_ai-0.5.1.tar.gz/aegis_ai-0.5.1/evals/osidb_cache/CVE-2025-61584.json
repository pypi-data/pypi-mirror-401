    "statement": "",
    "comment_zero": "serverless-dns is a RethinkDNS resolver that deploys to Cloudflare Workers, Deno Deploy, Fastly, and Fly.io. Versions through abd including 0.1.30 have a vulnerability where the pr.yml GitHub Action interpolates in an unsafe manner untrusted input, specifically the github.event.pull_request.head.repo.clone_url and github.head_ref, to a command in the runner. Due to the action using the pull_request_target trigger it has permissive permissions by default. An unauthorized attacker can exploit this vulnerability to push arbitrary data to the repository. The subsequent impact on the end-user is executing the attackers' code when running serverless-dns. This is fixed in commit c5537dd, and expected to be released in 0.1.31.",
