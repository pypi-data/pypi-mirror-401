    "description": "A flaw was found in libcurl. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow via an integer overflow in zlib 1.2.0.3 or older when libcurl performs automatic gzip decompression.",
    "explanation": "The suggested statement highlights the low impact on Red Hat products due to the dependency on older zlib versions and specific usage conditions for libcurl's gzip decompression. The mitigation reflects that this is a code-level vulnerability for which no practical configuration-based workaround is available.",
    "suggested_statement": "This issue has a low impact on Red Hat products as it only affects libcurl when used with zlib versions 1.2.0.3 or older, which are not widely present in affected Red Hat components. The vulnerability requires specific conditions for exploitation related to automatic gzip decompression.",
    "suggested_mitigation": "Mitigation for this issue is either not available or the currently available options do not meet the Red Hat Product Security criteria comprising ease of use and deployment, applicability to widespread installation base, or stability."
