    "statement": "This CVE is not applicable to any supported version of Red Hat Enterprise Linux since RHEL-4.",
    "explanation": "The Red Hat CVSS3 score is 3.3 (Low), while the NVD CVSS3 score is 7.3 (High). The primary reason for this difference lies in the assessment of the Attack Vector (AV), Confidentiality (C), and Integrity (I) metrics.\n\nRed Hat assigns an Attack Vector of Local (AV:L), based on the specific context of its products. The vulnerability requires an outdated version of the zlib library (1.2.0.3 or older), which is not present in a remotely exploitable manner in supported Red Hat products. Consequently, Red Hat also assesses the impact on Confidentiality and Integrity as None (C:N, I:N), viewing the only potential impact as a local denial of service (Availability: Low).\n\nIn contrast, NVD provides a more generic assessment, rating the Attack Vector as Network (AV:N). This assumes a general use case where the vulnerable libcurl component could be exposed to network-based attacks. This broader perspective leads NVD to assign Low impacts to Confidentiality (C:L) and Integrity (I:L), resulting in a significantly higher overall score. Red Hat's scoring reflects the specific, mitigated risk within its own software ecosystem."
