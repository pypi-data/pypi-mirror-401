    "Screen 5.0.0"
  ],
  "affected_products": [],
  "explanation": "The vulnerability in Screen 5.0.0 allows an unprivileged local user to escalate privileges to root. This is due to the application not dropping setuid-root privileges when handling user-supplied paths, enabling the creation of root-owned files and subsequent privilege escalation. This aligns with a CVSS 3.1 score of 8.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H), categorizing the impact as IMPORTANT.",
