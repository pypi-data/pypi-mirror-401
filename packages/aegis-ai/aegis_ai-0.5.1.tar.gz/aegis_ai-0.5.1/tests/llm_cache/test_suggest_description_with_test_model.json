    "original_title": "Buffer Overflow in libcurl via zlib Integer Overflow",
    "original_description": "A flaw was found in libcurl. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trigger a buffer overflow via an integer overflow in zlib 1.2.0.3 or older when libcurl performs automatic gzip decompression.",

        "libcurl"
    ],
    "explanation": "The original title was slightly long and included implementation details (zlib). The suggested title is more concise, focusing on the component and the direct vulnerability type. The original description was clear but a bit verbose. The suggested description is more direct, specifying the attack vector (malicious HTTP response) and clarifying the conditions (automatic gzip decompression with old zlib) in a more streamlined manner, adhering to the structured format.",

    "suggested_description": "A flaw was found in libcurl. This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to cause a buffer overflow via a specially crafted gzip-compressed HTTP response when automatic decompression is enabled with an older version of zlib."
