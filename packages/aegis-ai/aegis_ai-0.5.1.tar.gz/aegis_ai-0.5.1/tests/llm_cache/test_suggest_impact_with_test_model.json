    "explanation": "The vulnerability is a buffer overflow within libcurl that occurs during the automatic decompression of gzip-encoded content. However, this flaw is only exploitable when libcurl is used in conjunction with a significantly outdated version of the zlib library (1.2.0.3 or older). Supported Red Hat products, including Red Hat Enterprise Linux, utilize modern versions of zlib and are therefore not affected. The impact is rated as LOW because the conditions required for a successful exploit are highly unlikely to be present in any supported Red Hat environment. The official Red Hat CVSS vector indicates a low-impact, local availability issue, reflecting the minimal practical risk.",
