           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or

              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Cleanlab’s open-source library helps you **clean** data and **lab**els by automatically detecting issues in a ML dataset. To facilitate **machine learning with messy, real-world data**, this data-centric AI package uses your *existing* models to estimate dataset problems that can be fixed to train even *better* models.
 

<p align="center">

</p>
<p align="center">
    Examples of various issues in Cat/Dog dataset <b>automatically detected</b> by cleanlab via this code:    
</p>

```python
        lab = cleanlab.Datalab(data=dataset, label="column_name_for_labels")
        # Fit any ML model, get its feature_embeddings & pred_probs for your data
        lab.find_issues(features=feature_embeddings, pred_probs=pred_probs)
        lab.report()
```

- Use cleanlab to automatically check every: [text](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/datalab/text.html), [audio](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/datalab/audio.html), [image](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/datalab/image.html), or [tabular](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/datalab/tabular.html) dataset.
- Use cleanlab to automatically: [detect data issues (outliers, duplicates, label errors, etc)](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/datalab/datalab_quickstart.html), [train robust models](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/indepth_overview.html), [infer consensus + annotator-quality for multi-annotator data](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/multiannotator.html), [suggest data to (re)label next (active learning)](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples/blob/master/active_learning_multiannotator/active_learning.ipynb).

## Run cleanlab open-source

This cleanlab package runs on Python 3.10+ and supports Linux, macOS, as well as Windows.

- Get started [here](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/)! Install via `uv`, `pip`, or `conda`.
- Developers who install the bleeding-edge from source should refer to [this master branch documentation](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/master/index.html).

**Practicing data-centric AI can look like this:**
1. Train initial ML model on original dataset.
2. Utilize this model to diagnose data issues (via cleanlab methods) and improve the dataset.
3. Train the same model on the improved dataset. 
4. Try various modeling techniques to further improve performance.

Most folks jump from Step 1 → 4, but you may achieve big gains without *any* change to your modeling code by using cleanlab!
Continuously boost performance by iterating Steps 2 → 4 (and try to evaluate with *cleaned* data).

## Use cleanlab with any model and in most ML tasks

All features of cleanlab work with **any dataset** and **any model**. Yes, any model: PyTorch, Tensorflow, Keras, JAX, HuggingFace, OpenAI, XGBoost, scikit-learn, etc.

cleanlab is useful across a wide variety of Machine Learning tasks. Specific tasks this data-centric AI package offers dedicated functionality for include:
1. [Binary and multi-class classification](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/indepth_overview.html)
2. [Multi-label classification](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/multilabel_classification.html) (e.g. image/document tagging)
3. [Token classification](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/token_classification.html) (e.g. entity recognition in text)
4. [Regression](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/regression.html) (predicting numerical column in a dataset)
5. [Image segmentation](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/segmentation.html) (images with per-pixel annotations)
6. [Object detection](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/object_detection.html) (images with bounding box annotations)
7. [Classification with data labeled by multiple annotators](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/multiannotator.html)
8. [Active learning with multiple annotators](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples/blob/master/active_learning_multiannotator/active_learning.ipynb) (suggest which data to label or re-label to improve model most)
9. [Outlier detection](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/tutorials/outliers.html) (identify atypical data that appears out of distribution)

For other ML tasks, cleanlab can still help you improve your dataset if appropriately applied.
See our [Example Notebooks](https://github.com/cleanlab/examples) and [Blog](https://cleanlab.ai/blog/learn/).


## So fresh, so cleanlab

Beyond automatically catching [all sorts of issues](https://docs.cleanlab.ai/stable/cleanlab/datalab/guide/issue_type_description.html) lurking in your data, this data-centric AI package helps you deal with **noisy labels** and train more **robust ML models**.
Here's an example:

```python

# cleanlab works with **any classifier**. Yup, you can use PyTorch/TensorFlow/OpenAI/XGBoost/etc.
cl = cleanlab.classification.CleanLearning(sklearn.YourFavoriteClassifier())

# cleanlab finds data and label issues in **any dataset**... in ONE line of code!
label_issues = cl.find_label_issues(data, labels)

# cleanlab trains a robust version of your model that works more reliably with noisy data.
cl.fit(data, labels)

# cleanlab estimates the predictions you would have gotten if you had trained with *no* label issues.
cl.predict(test_data)

# A universal data-centric AI tool, cleanlab quantifies class-level issues and overall data quality, for any dataset.
cleanlab.dataset.health_summary(labels, confident_joint=cl.confident_joint)
```

cleanlab **clean**s your data's **lab**els via state-of-the-art *confident learning* algorithms, published in this [paper](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12125) and [blog](https://l7.curtisnorthcutt.com/confident-learning). See some of the datasets cleaned with cleanlab at [labelerrors.com](https://labelerrors.com).

cleanlab is:

1. **backed by theory** -- with [provable guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.00068) of exact label noise estimation, even with imperfect models.
2. **fast** -- code is parallelized and scalable.
4. **easy to use** -- one line of code to find mislabeled data, bad annotators, outliers, or train noise-robust models.
6. **general** -- works with **[any dataset](https://labelerrors.com/)** (text, image, tabular, audio,...) + **any model** (PyTorch, OpenAI, XGBoost,...)

Examples of incorrect given labels in various image datasets <a href="https://l7.curtisnorthcutt.com/label-errors">found and corrected</a> using cleanlab. 
While these examples are from image datasets, this also works for text, audio, tabular data.
