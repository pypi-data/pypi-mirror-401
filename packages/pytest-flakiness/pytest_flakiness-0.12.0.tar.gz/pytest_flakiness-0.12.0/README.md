The official [Flakiness.io](https://flakiness.io) reporter for **pytest**.

> [!TIP]
> Report demo is available at https://flakiness.io/flakiness/pytest-flakiness

## Installation

Install using **uv** (recommended):

```bash
uv add --dev pytest-flakiness
```

Or via standard pip:

```bash
pip install pytest-flakiness
```

## Usage

Once installed, simply run pytest. The reporter will automatically activate, aggregate test results,
and create Flakiness Report in the `flakiness-report` directory.

```bash
pytest
```

The generated report can be viewed interactively via the [Flakiness CLI Tool](https://flakiness.io/docs/cli):

```bash
flakiness show
```

> [!TIP]
> Make sure to add `flakiness-report` directory to your `.gitignore`
> ```gitignore
> flakiness-report/
> ```


If Flakiness Access Token is passed, then the reporter will upload the report to Flakiness.io.
You will see a confirmation in your terminal summary:

```text
...
PASSED [100%]
==============================
✅ [Flakiness] Report uploaded: https://flakiness.io/your_org/your_proj/run/1
==============================
```

## Uploading Reports to Flakiness.io

To upload reports, you need your project's **Access Token**. You can find this in your project settings on [flakiness.io](https://flakiness.io).

Set the Access Token using either an environment variable (recommended for CI/CD) or command-line flag:

```bash
export FLAKINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN="flakiness-io-..."
pytest --flakiness-access-token="flakiness-io-..."
```


### All Configuration Options

All options can be set via environment variables or command-line flags:

| Flag | Environment Variable | Description |
|------|---------------------|-------------|
| `--flakiness-name` | `FLAKINESS_NAME` | Name for this environment. Defaults to `pytest` |
| `--flakiness-output-dir` | `FLAKINESS_OUTPUT_DIR` | Local directory to save JSON report. Defaults to `flakiness-report` |
| `--flakiness-access-token` | `FLAKINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN` | Your Flakiness.io access token (required for upload) |
| `--flakiness-endpoint` | `FLAKINESS_ENDPOINT` | Flakiness.io service endpoint. Defaults to `https://flakiness.io` |

### Custom Environment Data

You can add custom metadata to your test runs using `FK_ENV_*` environment variables. These might be handy
to capture properties that affect system-under-test.

```bash
export FK_ENV_GPU_TYPE="H100"
export FK_ENV_DEPLOYMENT="staging"
```

The `FK_ENV_` prefix is removed and keys are lowercased, e.g. `FK_ENV_DEPLOYMENT` becomes `deployment`, and `FK_ENV_GPU_TYPE` becomses `gpu_type`.

### Local Development

To save reports locally, pass `--flakiness-output-dir`:

```bash
pytest --flakiness-output-dir=./flakiness-reports
```

This will create a `report.json` file and an `attachments/` directory in the specified folder.

## CI/CD Example (GitHub Actions)

To ensure reports are uploaded during your CI runs, map the secret in your workflow:

```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  env:
    FLAKINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.FLAKINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN }}
  run: pytest
```

Or use the command-line flag:

```yaml
- name: Run Tests
  run: pytest --flakiness-access-token="${{ secrets.FLAKINESS_ACCESS_TOKEN }}"
```

## 🛠️ Development Setup

This project uses `uv` for dependency management and `pre-commit` for code quality checks.

### 1. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) installed, then run:

```bash
uv sync
```

### 2\. Enable Git Hooks

This project uses `ruff` (formatting/linting) and `pyright` (type checking) as pre-commit hooks. You must install the git hooks to ensure checks run automatically before you commit:

```bash
uv run pre-commit install
```

### 3\. (Optional) Run Checks Manually

You can trigger the full suite of checks on all files at any time:

```bash
uv run pre-commit run --all-files
```
