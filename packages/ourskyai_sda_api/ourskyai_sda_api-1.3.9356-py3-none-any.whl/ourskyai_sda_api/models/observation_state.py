    The basic flow for a new organization is as follows: 1. View the available satellite targets with the [satellite targets](#tag/satellite-targets/GET/v1/satellite-targets) endpoint. Copy the id of the target you want to observe. 2. Create an organization target with the [organization target](#tag/organization-targets/GET/v1/organization-targets) endpoint. Use the id copied from above. 3. Create a webhook with the [webhook](#tag/webhooks/POST/v1/communications/webhook) endpoint to receive OSRs automatically (preferred) or use the [OSRs](#tag/observation-sequence-results/GET/v1/observation-sequence-results) endpoint to poll for OSRs.  Check out our [examples](https://github.com/ourskyai/oursky-examples) repository to see usage in each language.
