"""Pytest plugin integration for activemodel.

Currently provides:

* ``db_session`` fixture - quick access to a database session (see ``test_session``)
* ``activemodel_preserve_tables`` ini option - configure tables to preserve when using
  ``database_reset_truncate`` (comma separated list or multiple lines depending on config style)

Configuration examples:

pytest.ini::

    [pytest]
    activemodel_preserve_tables = alembic_version,zip_code,seed_table

pyproject.toml::

    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    activemodel_preserve_tables = [
      "alembic_version",
      "zip_code",
      "seed_table",
    ]

The list always implicitly includes ``alembic_version`` even if not specified.
