t
    Number of diffusion time steps. This parameter controls the degree of

    smoothing."""

_diffusion_method = """\
diffusion_method
    Method for computing powers of the mapping matrix (only valid in self-mapping mode). Options are "iterative" for
    iterative matrix multiplication (inspired by MAGIC :cite:`van2018recovering`) and "spectral" for
    eigendecomposition-based approach. """

_prediction_postfix = """\
prediction_postfix
    Postfix to append to mapped variable names (including any separator, e.g. "_pred"). Use "" for no postfix."""

symmetrize
    If True, create a symmetrize connectivity matrix. Only valid for square matrices (self-mapping).
    If None (default), uses True for self-mapping and False for cross-mapping."""

_self_edges = """\
self_edges
    Control self-edges (diagonal entries) for square matrices (self-mapping).
    If None (default), uses False for self-mapping (scanpy style) and None for cross-mapping.
    This controls whether or not the kernel used to compute the connectivities is supplied with self-edges.
    It does not determine whether the final connectivity matrix has self edges. For example, the `umap`
    kernel expectes self-edges, but does not produce them in the final connectivity matrix."""

only_yx
    If True, only compute the xy neighbors. In self-mapping mode, this is

_kernel_method = """\
kernel_method
    Method to use for computing the mapping matrix. Options include:

    - "jaccard": Jaccard similarity. Inspired by GLUE :cite:`cao2022multi`

    - "scarches": scArches kernel. Inspired by scArches :cite:`lotfollahi2022mapping`

subset_categories
    For categorical data, optionally specify a subset of categories to include in the mapping.
    If None (default), all categories are included. If specified, only the listed categories
