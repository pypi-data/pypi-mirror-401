    """
    Create a sequential pipeline from a list of subgraphs.

    This function allows you to compose multiple StateGraphs in a sequential fashion,
    where each subgraph executes one after another. This is useful for creating
    complex multi-agent workflows where agents need to work in a specific order.

    Args:
        sub_graphs: List of sub-graphs to execute sequentially
        state_schema: state schema of the final constructed graph
        graph_name: Name of the final constructed graph
        context_schema: context schema of the final constructed graph
        input_schema: input schema of the final constructed graph
        output_schema: output schema of the final constructed graph
        checkpointer: Optional LangGraph checkpointer for the final constructed
            graph
        store: Optional LangGraph store for the final constructed graph
        cache: Optional LangGraph cache for the final constructed graph

    Returns:
        CompiledStateGraph[StateT, ContextT, InputT, OutputT]: Compiled state
            graph of the pipeline.
