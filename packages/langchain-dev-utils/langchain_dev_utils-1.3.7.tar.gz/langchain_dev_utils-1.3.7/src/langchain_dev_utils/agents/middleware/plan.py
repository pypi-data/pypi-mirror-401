_DEFAULT_WRITE_PLAN_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for complex or multi-step work. It helps you stay organized, track progress, and demonstrate to the user that you’re handling tasks systematically.

## When to Use This Tool  
Use this tool in the following scenarios:

1. **Complex multi-step tasks** — when a task requires three or more distinct steps or actions.  
2. **Non-trivial and complex tasks** — tasks that require careful planning or involve multiple operations.  
3. **User explicitly requests a to-do list** — when the user directly asks you to use the to-do list feature.  
4. **User provides multiple tasks** — when the user supplies a list of items to be done (e.g., numbered or comma-separated).  
5. **The plan needs adjustment based on current execution** — when ongoing progress indicates the plan should be revised.

## How to Use This Tool  
1. **When starting a task** — before actually beginning work, invoke this tool with a task list (a list of strings). The first task will automatically be set to `in_progress`, and all others to `pending`.  
2. **When updating the task list** — for example, after completing some tasks, if you find certain tasks are no longer needed, remove them; if new necessary tasks emerge, add them. However, **do not modify** tasks already marked as completed. In such cases, simply call this tool again with the updated task list.

## When NOT to Use This Tool  
Avoid using this tool in the following situations:  
1. The task is a **single, straightforward action**.  
2. The task is **too trivial**, and tracking it provides no benefit.  
3. The task can be completed in **fewer than three simple steps**.  
4. The current task list has been fully completed — in this case, use `finish_sub_plan()` to finalize.

## How It Works  
- **Input**: A parameter named `plan` containing a list of strings representing the tasks (e.g., `["Task 1", "Task 2", "Task 3"]`).  
- **Automatic status assignment**:  
  → First task: `in_progress`  
  → Remaining tasks: `pending`  
- When updating the plan, provide only the **next set of tasks to execute**. For example, if the next phase requires `["Task 4", "Task 5"]`, call this tool with `plan=["Task 4", "Task 5"]`.

## Task States  
- `pending`: Ready to start, awaiting execution  
- `in_progress`: Currently being worked on  
- `done`: Completed  

## Best Practices  
- Break large tasks into clear, actionable steps.  
- Use specific and descriptive task names.  
- Update the plan immediately if priorities shift or blockers arise.  
- Never leave the plan empty — as long as unfinished tasks remain, at least one must be marked `in_progress`.  
- Do not batch completions — mark each task as done immediately after finishing it.  
- Remove irrelevant tasks entirely instead of leaving them in `pending` state.

**Remember**: If a task is simple, just do it. This tool is meant to provide structure — not overhead.
"""

_DEFAULT_FINISH_SUB_PLAN_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """This tool is used to mark the currently in-progress task in an existing task list as completed.

## Functionality  
- Marks the current task with status `in_progress` as `done`, and automatically sets the next task (previously `pending`) to `in_progress`.

## When to Use  
Use only when you have confirmed that the current task is truly finished.

## Example  
Before calling:
```json
[
    {"content": "Task 1", "status": "done"},
    {"content": "Task 2", "status": "in_progress"},
    {"content": "Task 3", "status": "pending"}
]
```

After calling `finish_sub_plan()`:
```json
[
    {"content": "Task 1", "status": "done"},
    {"content": "Task 2", "status": "done"},
    {"content": "Task 3", "status": "in_progress"}
]
```

**Note**:  
- This tool is **only** for marking completion — do **not** use it to create or modify plans (use `write_plan` instead).  
- Ensure the task is genuinely complete before invoking this function.  
- No parameters are required — status updates are handled automatically.
