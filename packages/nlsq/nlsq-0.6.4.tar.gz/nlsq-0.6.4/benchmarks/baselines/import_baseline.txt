# NLSQ Import Time Baseline
# Date: 2025-12-26
# Target: <400ms (SC-001)

Cold import time: 1084.4ms

# Note: This includes JAX initialization overhead.
# The spec target of 400ms is based on the analysis report's
# measurement of 793ms, suggesting different baseline conditions.
# Our optimization goal remains: reduce import time by 50%+
