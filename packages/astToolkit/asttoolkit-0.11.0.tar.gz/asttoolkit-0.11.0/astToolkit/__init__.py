"""A powerfully composable, type-safe toolkit for Python Abstract Syntax Tree analysis, transformation, and code generation.

(AI generated docstring)

The `astToolkit` package provides a layered architecture designed for composability and type safety in AST
operations. It implements the antecedent-action pattern where predicates identify nodes and actions operate
on matched nodes through visitor classes.

Core Architecture Layers
------------------------

**Atomic Classes (Foundation Layer)**
- `Be`: Type guard functions returning `TypeIs[ast.NodeType]` for safe type narrowing
- `DOT`: Read-only attribute accessors with sophisticated typing support
- `Grab`: Attribute modification functions that transform specific node attributes
- `Make`: Factory methods for creating properly configured AST nodes

**Visitor Classes (Traversal Layer)**
- `NodeTourist`: Read-only AST traversal extending `ast.NodeVisitor`
- `NodeChanger`: Destructive AST modification extending `ast.NodeTransformer`

**Composable APIs (Predicate/Action Layer)**
- `IfThis`: Predicate functions for node identification and pattern matching
- `Then`: Action functions for matched nodes including collection, transformation, and extraction

**Container Classes (High-Level Layer)**
- `IngredientsFunction`: Function representation with dependencies and metadata
- `IngredientsModule`: Complete module builder combining functions, imports, and constructs
- `LedgerOfImports`: Import dependency tracking and management

Type System
-----------
The package includes 120+ specialized type aliases (`hasDOT*` types) that map AST node attributes to
their containing node types, enabling type-safe attribute access and powering the `DOT` and related classes.

Antecedent-Action Pattern
-------------------------
The core pattern follows: **Predicate** (identifies nodes) + **Action** (operates on nodes) via visitor classes.

- **Antecedents**: `Be.*`, `IfThis.*`, `DOT.*` methods for node identification
- **Actions**: `Then.*`, `Make.*`, `Grab.*` methods for node operations
- **Application**: `NodeTourist(antecedent, action)` or `NodeChanger(antecedent, action)`

Examples
--------
Extract parameter names from function definitions:

    function_def = tree.body[0]
    param_name = NodeTourist(
        Be.arg,
        Then.extractIt(DOT.arg)
    ).captureLastMatch(function_def)

Transform multiplication to addition:

    NodeChanger(
        Be.Mult,
        Then.replaceWith(ast.Add())
    ).visit(tree)
