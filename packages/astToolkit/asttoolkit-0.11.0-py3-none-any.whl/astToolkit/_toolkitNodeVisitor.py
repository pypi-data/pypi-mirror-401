"""AST Traversal and Transformation Classes.

(AI generated docstring)

This module provides the foundational visitor infrastructure for the astToolkit package, implementing the
antecedent-action pattern through specialized AST traversal classes. These classes enable precise, type-safe AST
operations by combining predicate functions (antecedents) with action functions (consequents).

The antecedent-action pattern forms the conceptual core of astToolkit's design. Antecedents are predicate functions
that identify target nodes using tools like `Be` type guards, `IfThis` predicates. Actions are consequent functions that specify operations to perform on matched nodes using tools like
`Then` actions, `Grab` transformations, or custom operations.

This module contains two complementary visitor classes that extend Python's built-in AST visitor pattern:

`NodeTourist` extends `ast.NodeVisitor` for read-only AST traversal and information extraction. It applies action
functions to nodes that satisfy predicate conditions, capturing results without modifying the original AST
structure. This class enables analysis workflows, validation operations, and data extraction tasks where the AST
should remain unmodified.

`NodeChanger` extends `ast.NodeTransformer` for destructive AST modification and code transformation. It
selectively transforms nodes that satisfy predicate conditions, enabling targeted changes while preserving overall
tree structure and semantics. This class forms the foundation for code optimization, refactoring, and generation
workflows.

Both classes support generic type parameters for type-safe node matching and result handling, integrating
seamlessly with astToolkit's type system and atomic classes to create composable, maintainable AST manipulation
code.

	"""Read-only AST visitor that extracts information from nodes matching predicate conditions.

	(AI generated docstring)

	`NodeTourist` implements the antecedent-action pattern for non-destructive AST analysis. It traverses an AST
	tree, applies predicate functions to identify target nodes, and executes action functions on matches to extract
	or analyze information. The visitor preserves the original AST structure while capturing results from matching
	nodes.

	This class is particularly useful for analysis workflows where you need to gather information about specific
	node types or patterns without modifying the source code structure. The generic type parameters ensure type
	safety when working with specific AST node types and return values.

	Parameters
	----------
	findThis : Callable[[ast.AST], TypeIs[木] | bool]
		Predicate function that tests AST nodes. Can return either a `TypeIs` for type narrowing or a
		simple boolean. When using `TypeIs`, the type checker can safely narrow the node type for the action
		function.
	doThat : Callable[[木], 归个]
		Action function that operates on nodes matching the predicate. Receives the matched node with
		properly narrowed typing and returns the extracted information.

	Examples
	--------
	Extract all bicycle component names from a module:
	```python
	bicycleComponentCollector = NodeTourist(Be.FunctionDef, lambda wheelFunction: DOT.name(wheelFunction))
	componentNames = []
	bicycleComponentCollector.doThat = Then.appendTo(componentNames)
	bicycleComponentCollector.visit(bicycleModule)
	```

	Find specific kitchen recipe definition:
	```python
	specificRecipe = NodeTourist(IfThis.isFunctionDefIdentifier("bakeBread"), Then.extractIt)
	foundRecipe = specificRecipe.captureLastMatch(kitchenModule)
	```

		is applied to the node and the result is captured in `nodeCaptured`.

		The method continues standard AST traversal by calling `generic_visit` to ensure all child nodes are

		action functionality.

		node : ast.AST

		This method provides a convenient interface for single-result extraction workflows. It resets the internal
		capture state, traverses the provided AST tree, and returns the result from the most recently matched node.
		If no nodes match the predicate, returns `None`.

		The method is particularly useful when you expect exactly one match or when you only care about the final
		match in traversal order. For collecting multiple matches, modify the `doThat` action function to append
		results to a collection.

		Parameters
		----------
		node : ast.AST
			Root AST node to begin traversal from. Can be any AST node type including modules, functions,
			classes, or expressions.

class NodeChanger(ast.NodeTransformer, Generic[木, 归个]):  # noqa: UP046
	"""Destructive AST transformer that selectively modifies nodes matching predicate conditions.

	(AI generated docstring)

	`NodeChanger` implements the antecedent-action pattern for targeted AST transformation. It extends Python's
	`ast.NodeTransformer` to provide precise control over which nodes are modified during tree traversal. The
	transformer applies predicate functions to identify target nodes and executes action functions to perform
	modifications, replacements, or deletions.

	This class forms the foundation for code optimization, refactoring, and generation workflows. Unlike
	`NodeTourist`, `NodeChanger` modifies the AST structure and returns a transformed tree. The transformation
	is applied recursively, ensuring that nested structures are properly processed.

	The class is designed for scenarios where you need to make surgical changes to specific parts of an AST while
	preserving the overall structure and semantics of the code. Common use cases include function inlining,
	variable renaming, dead code elimination, and pattern-based code transformations.

	Parameters
	----------
	findThis : Callable[[ast.AST], TypeIs[木] | bool]
		Predicate function that identifies nodes to transform. Should return `True` for nodes that require
		modification and `False` for nodes that should remain unchanged. The function receives an `ast.AST` node
		and determines whether transformation is needed.
	doThat : Callable[[木], 归个]
		Action function that performs the actual transformation. Receives nodes that matched the predicate
		and returns the replacement node, modified node, or `None` for deletion. The return value becomes the new
		node in the transformed tree.

	Examples
	--------
	Replace all bicycle wheel references with tire references:
	```python
	wheelReplacer = NodeChanger(
			IfThis.isCallIdentifier("checkWheel"),
			Then.replaceWith(Make.Call(Make.Name("checkTire"), [], []))
	)
	transformedBicycle = wheelReplacer.visit(bicycleAST)
	```

	Remove all kitchen cleanup statements:
	```python
	cleanupRemover = NodeChanger(Be.Pass, Then.removeIt)
	streamlinedKitchen = cleanupRemover.visit(kitchenAST)
	```

		Parameters
