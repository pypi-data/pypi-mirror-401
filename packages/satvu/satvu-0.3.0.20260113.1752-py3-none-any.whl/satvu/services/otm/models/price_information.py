            the price may change at order submission time after relevant addons and required licence level have been
            accounted for.

            currency e.g. pence, cents.
        licence_level (int | None): The price of the order from the chosen licence level in minor units of the currency
            e.g. pence, cents.
        total (int | None): The total price of the order in minor units of the currency e.g. pence, cents. This is the
            sum of the base and addon prices.
