    Attributes:
        datetime_ (str): The closed date-time interval of the tasking order request.
        created_at (datetime.datetime): The datetime at which the feasibility response was created.
        updated_at (datetime.datetime): The datetime at which the feasibility response was last updated.
        product (Union[Literal['standard'], None]): Standard Priority. Default: 'standard'.
        satvu_day_night_mode (Union[None, 'DayNightMode']):
        max_cloud_cover (Union[None, int]): The max threshold of acceptable cloud coverage. Measured in percent.
            Default: 15.
        min_off_nadir (Union[None, int]): The minimum angle from the sensor between nadir and the scene center. Measured
            in decimal degrees. Default: 0.
        max_off_nadir (Union[None, int]): The maximum angle from the sensor between nadir and the scene center. Measured
            in decimal degrees. Must be larger than `min_off_nadir`. Default: 30.
        price (Union['Price', None]): Pricing information.
        min_sun_el (float | None): The minimum sun elevation angle of the pass. Measured in decimal degrees from the
            horizontal.
        max_sun_el (float | None): The maximum sun elevation angle of the pass. Measured in decimal degrees from the
            horizontal.
        min_gsd (float | None): The minimum ground sample distance value of the pass. Measured in metres representing
            the square root of the area of the pixel size projected onto the earth.
        max_gsd (float | None): The maximum ground sample distance value of the pass. Measured in metres representing
            the square root of the area of the pixel size projected onto the earth.
