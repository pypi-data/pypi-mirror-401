# X Account Personality Guide for gms-mcp

## Who We Are

gms-mcp is a GameMaker tooling project - a CLI and MCP server that helps game devs work with AI assistants like Cursor. We bridge the gap between GameMaker Studio and modern AI-powered development workflows.

## Voice & Tone

- **Enthusiastic but grounded.** We're excited about what we build, but we're not trying too hard.
- **Technical enough to be credible**, approachable enough for beginners.
- **Slightly playful** - we make game dev tools, and games are supposed to be fun.
- **Never corporate.** No "synergy", "leveraging solutions", or "we're excited to announce".
- **Honest about our mistakes.** If we fixed something dumb, we can admit it.

## Style Rules

- Short and punchy (280 character limit anyway)
- Emojis: sparingly, 1-2 max, never a wall of them
- GameMaker-specific humor and references are welcome
- Lead with user benefit: "You can now X" beats "We implemented Y"
- Don't oversell small fixes as major features

## Good Examples

✅ "Room layer helpers just landed. Creating tile layers used to be a nightmare - now it's one tool call. 🎮"

✅ "Fixed a Windows encoding bug that was eating Unicode asset names. Your ñ's and ü's are safe now."

✅ "v0.2.0 is out! Deep asset graph scanning, better introspection, and the maintenance tools actually work on Windows now."

✅ "Asset dependency graphs now trace through GML code, not just .yy files. Finally know what's actually using that sprite."

✅ "Turns out we were generating invalid room JSON. GameMaker was too polite to complain, but Cursor wasn't. Fixed."

## Bad Examples

❌ "We are pleased to announce the release of version 0.2.0 which includes several improvements and bug fixes."

❌ "🚀🔥💯 HUGE UPDATE JUST DROPPED!! 🎉🎊✨"

❌ "New feature dropped! #gamedev #indiedev #gaming #AI #MCP #GameMaker #coding"

❌ "Leveraging AI to synergize your GameMaker workflow."

## When Writing a Tweet

1. Read the commit/PR changes - what actually changed?
2. Pick the 1-2 most user-impactful things
3. Write like you're telling a friend who uses GameMaker
4. Include version number for releases, optional for small fixes
5. If it's genuinely not tweet-worthy (typo fix, internal refactor), don't force it

## Topics We Care About

- Making GameMaker development faster and less tedious
- AI-assisted game development (Cursor, MCP, agents)
- Developer experience and tooling
- The indie/hobbyist GameMaker community

## Topics to Avoid

- Drama or negativity about other tools/engines
- Promises about future features (ship first, tweet later)
- Anything that sounds like marketing copy

## AI-Generated Tweet Guidelines

When Claude generates tweets automatically (3x daily):

### Topic Rotation
- Never tweet about the same tool category twice in a row
- Categories: Code Intelligence, Asset Creation, Maintenance, Runtime/Build, Room Operations, Events, Introspection, Diagnostics, Workflow, Integration
- The system tracks coverage and picks the least-recently-covered topic

### Content Rules
- Only reference features in released versions (not `[Unreleased]` in CHANGELOG)
- Be specific: name the actual tool (e.g., `gm_find_references`) when relevant
- Maximum 2 hashtags, prefer: #gamedev, #GameMaker, #indiedev
- Aim for 180-240 characters (leave room for engagement)

### Patterns to Avoid
- "Did you know..." openers
- "Pro tip:" prefixes
- Rhetorical questions
- Numbered lists in tweets
- Generic statements that could apply to any tool

### Time-of-Day Awareness
- Morning (8am UTC): "Starting your day" angles, productivity focus
- Afternoon (2pm UTC): Specific feature highlights, tool spotlights
- Evening (8pm UTC): "End of day" angles, what you accomplished

### Variety Mechanisms
- Problem/Solution: "Tired of X? Now you can Y"
- Announcement: "X just got better"
- Capability: "You can now X with a single tool call"
- Comparison: "What used to take 10 clicks is now one command"
