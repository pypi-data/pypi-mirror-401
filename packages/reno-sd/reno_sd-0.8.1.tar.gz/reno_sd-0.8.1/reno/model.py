    The expectation is to create a model instance, and then assign stocks,

        name (str): Optional name to give the model, should be used when
            submodels are in play, as the model name is used to help
            visually distinguish which model things belong to.

        label (str): Optional visual label to use when printing model things if
            cleaner than using the name.
        doc (str): Optional docstring to explain/describe the model.

                with ``show_vars=True`` to just show specific variables of interest.
            sparklines (bool): Draw mini graphs to the right of each stock showing plotting their
                values through time. This assumes the model has either been run, or traces are passed

                sample from distributions. This assumes the model has either been run, or traces
                are passed in manually with the ``traces`` argument.
            g (Digraph): Graphviz Digraph instance to render the nodes/edges on. Mostly only for
                internal use for drawing subgraphs for submodels.
            traces (list[xr.Dataset]): A list of traces or model run datasets to use for drawing
                spark plots. Each dataset will be rendered in a different color.
            universe (list[TrackedReference]): Limit rendered nodes to only those listed here, this

                and ``exclude_var_names`` still applies after this.)
            lr (bool): By default the graphviz plot tries to orient top-down. Specify ``True`` to
                try to orient it left-right.
            hide_groups (list[str]): A list of group/cgroup names to hide during diagramming, overriding
                model.default_hide_groups.
            show_groups (list[str]): A list of group/cgroup names to show during diagramming, overriding
                model.default_hide_groups.
            group_colors dict[str | tuple["reno.components.TrackedReference"], str]: Dictionary specifying
                colors to render groups with. An ad-hoc group defined by a tuple of references can also be
                used as a key if the appropriate cgroup does not already exist on the references.
