📁 File Location Convention for Multiple Epics per BRD:
Save this file as: requirements/XXX-feature-name/epic-NNN-epic-title.md

Examples for a single BRD split into multiple epics:
  requirements/001-payment-system/epic-001-core-payments.md
  requirements/001-payment-system/epic-002-payment-methods.md
  requirements/001-payment-system/epic-003-refund-workflow.md
  
  requirements/042-user-dashboard/epic-001-dashboard-foundation.md
  requirements/042-user-dashboard/epic-002-analytics-widgets.md

Why multiple epics per BRD?
- Keeps each epic focused and manageable (typically 2-4 weeks per epic)
- Allows parallel team execution
- Enables incremental delivery and faster feedback
- Easier to track progress and dependencies
- Prevents epic scope creep

When to split a BRD into multiple epics:
✅ Estimated effort > 6 weeks
✅ Multiple distinct user workflows involved
✅ Can be delivered in sequential phases with independent value
✅ Multiple teams or specializations needed
✅ Clear boundaries between technical components

Epic naming pattern: epic-NNN-[phase/component]-[focus].md

## 9. Epic Breakdown Best Practices

### ✅ Good Epic Size Indicators:
-   Can be completed in 2-4 weeks by a focused team
-   Has clear, measurable success criteria
-   Delivers independent user value (or technical foundation)
-   Has <15 user stories or tasks
-   Single team can own it
-   Clear start and end points

### ⚠️ Signs Your Epic is Too Large:
-   Estimated > 6 weeks of work
-   Multiple teams need to coordinate extensively
-   Too many dependencies to track
-   Success metrics are vague or too broad
-   Scope keeps expanding during planning
-   → **Solution**: Split into multiple sequential epics

### 💡 How to Split a BRD into Multiple Epics:

**Option 1: Sequential Phases**
- Epic 1: Foundation/Infrastructure
- Epic 2: Core Features
- Epic 3: Advanced Features

**Option 2: By User Journey**
- Epic 1: User Acquisition Flow
- Epic 2: Activation Flow
- Epic 3: Retention Features

**Option 3: By Technical Layer**
- Epic 1: Backend API
- Epic 2: Frontend UI
- Epic 3: Integration & Testing

**Option 4: By Feature Set**
- Epic 1: Payment Method A (Credit Card)
- Epic 2: Payment Method B (PayPal)
- Epic 3: Refunds & Disputes
