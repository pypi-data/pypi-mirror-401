## 1. Executive Summary
*A 2-minute read for executives. What are we doing and why?*

### 1.1 Problem Statement
*What is the specific business problem or opportunity?*

[PROBLEM_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: "Our current checkout process has a 40% drop-off rate because users cannot pay with digital wallets like Apple Pay and Google Pay, which are preferred by 35% of our target demographic." -->

### 1.2 Proposed Solution
*High-level description of the solution.*

[SOLUTION_DESCRIPTION]

<!-- Example: "Integrate Apple Pay and Google Pay into the checkout flow to reduce friction and provide users with their preferred payment methods." -->

### 1.3 Business Value (ROI)
*Why should we invest in this now?*

-   **Revenue Impact**: [REVENUE_IMPACT]
-   **Cost Savings**: [COST_SAVINGS]

-   **Risk Mitigation**: [RISK_MITIGATION]

<!-- Example:
-   **Revenue Impact**: Estimated $150k increase in MRR (based on 5% conversion uplift)

-   [ ] [IN_SCOPE_ITEM_1]
-   [ ] [IN_SCOPE_ITEM_2]
-   [ ] [IN_SCOPE_ITEM_3]
-   [ ] [IN_SCOPE_ITEM_4]

<!-- Example:
-   [ ] Integration with Stripe for Apple Pay and Google Pay
-   [ ] UI updates to the Checkout page (button placement and styling)
-   [ ] Transaction history updates to show payment method type
-   [ ] Error handling and retry logic for failed digital wallet payments
-->

### 3.2 Out of Scope
*What are we explicitly NOT doing?*

-   [ ] [OUT_OF_SCOPE_ITEM_1]
-   [ ] [OUT_OF_SCOPE_ITEM_2]
-   [ ] [OUT_OF_SCOPE_ITEM_3]

<!-- Example:

-   [ ] "Buy Now, Pay Later" integrations like Klarna/Afterpay (moved to Phase 2)
-   [ ] Saved payment methods / wallet for returning customers (future consideration)
-->

### 3.3 Dependencies
*What needs to be in place before we can start?*

-   [DEPENDENCY_1]
-   [DEPENDENCY_2]

<!-- Example:
-   Stripe account must be upgraded to support digital wallets
-   Mobile app must be updated to SDK version 3.0+
-->

---

## 3.4 User Story Grouping (By Domain/Feature)
*How we will break down stories for planning and execution.*

**Merge when**:
-   CRUD operations for the same entity belong together
-   Similar UI interactions share the same flow
-   Features are tightly coupled and ship as one capability

**Separate when**:
-   Business logic is materially different
-   User flows are distinct
-   Features can be delivered independently

### Example Grouping
| Domain | Feature Group | Includes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Product Search | Search with autocomplete | Input field, autocomplete dropdown, search results, no results state |
| Shopping Cart | Cart management | Add item, remove item, update quantity, display total, empty cart |
| User Registration | Registration | Email/password form, validation, password strength, email verification, terms checkbox, success/error states |
