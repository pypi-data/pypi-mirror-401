### Create Links from browser

shortiepy supports creating short URLs from within your browser (without having to use CLI `add` command).

You can visit `/new` route and provide `code` (this will be used to generate short url) and `url` (the URL you want to create short link for) query paramters:

- `http://localhost:9876/new?code=meow&url=https://example.com`

    - It will create short link for `https://example.com` using provided short code: `http://localhost:9876/meow`

    - The `code` parameter is optional and can be omitted.

However, vising that URL and route manully is tedious! But if your browser allows it, like I have [Brave](https://brave.com/) browser, you can add a shortcut for it:

- In your browser go to settings and find "search engines". In Brave, it's `brave://settings/searchEngines` and add the following in "Site search":

  - Name: `shortiepy` (or anything you like)
  - Shortcut: `:sh` (or anything you like)
  - URL: `http://localhost:9876/new?url=%s`

Now when you want to create a short link, just type `:sh` in url bar and press `spacebar`, then you can paste the URL you want to create short link for and press enter!

## Shell Completion

Get tab-completion with **one command**:

```bash
shortiepy completion
```

> Restart your shell or reload config (`source ~/.bashrc` for bash OR `source ~/.zshrc` for zsh).
> Fish users: no restart needed!

That's it! Works for bash, zsh, and fish.

## Why

For some reason, when I’m working on things or trying to learn something new, my browser ends up filled with tons of tabs—which makes my laptop-chan angry ~ ₍^.  ̫.^₎

I don’t want to close them or bookmark them. I tried manually copying URLs into a `.txt` file, but then I wished there was a simple way to turn long links into short ones I could use later.

I didn’t want to send anything online, and existing self-hosted URL shorteners felt like overkill for such a small need.

So I made this: a minimal, local-only URL shortener. It started as a single script file and isn’t perfect—but it just works! ~ ദ്ദി/ᐠ｡‸｡ᐟ\


## For Developers

Want to tinker with `shortiepy` or contribute? Here's how to set it up locally:

- Clone the repository locally and change the directory into it:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CheapNightbot/shortiepy.git && cd shortiepy
```

- Install `shortiepy`:

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (keeps things clean!)
python -m venv .venv

# Activate it
source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# OR
.venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows

# Install in editable mode (changes reflect instantly!)
pip install -e .
```

Now you can run `shortiepy` from anywhere in your terminal!
Made a change? It’ll work immediately—no reinstall needed!

### Updating Shell Completions

If you modify CLI commands or options, regenerate completions:

```bash
./scripts/generate-completions.sh
```

> This updates the files in `shortiepy/completions/` directory.
