rules on them.

**Table of contents**

   :local:

Configuration
=============

To configure multiple prices you need to set multi prices field names
first. To do so, you need admin permissions. Then go to:

1. *Settings > Technical > Database Structure > Price Field Names*
2. Create the multi price fields you need.

If you have multiple companies, you can assign independent field sets
for each one.

Note: 'Show multi prices' access group must be checked to be able to add
multiple prices in the product form view.

Usage
=====

To use this module, you need to:

1. Go to the product page.
2. In the general tab, there's a list called *Other Prices*.
3. You can add one for every price name available.

To base pricelist rules on that fields, in the pricelist:

1. Add a rule and choose *formula* as the computing method.
2. In the *Based on* dropdown list, select *Other Price*.
3. A new list appear: *Other Price Name*. Pick the one you need.
4. Configure the formula.
5. Now the rule is based on that price for the products that have it
   configured. Otherwise, it will return 0.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- Add mechanisms that allow to set multiprices values from external
  flows. For example: having AVCO, FIFO and Standard prices computed
  simultaneously in this table.
