    Runs the provided synchronous function in a thread pool to avoid blocking

    Parameters
    ----------
    sync_callable : Callable[[], T]
        A zero-argument synchronous function to execute in a thread

    Returns
    -------

    Runs the provided synchronous function in a process pool to bypass Python's

    CPU-intensive operations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sync_callable : Callable[[], T]
        A zero-argument synchronous function to execute in a subprocess.
        Must be picklable and its return value must be serializable.

    Returns

    Notes
    -----
    - Uses a shared ProcessPoolExecutor managed by ProcessPoolManager
    - Bypasses Python's GIL for true parallel CPU-bound execution
    - The callable and its return value must be picklable/serializable
    - Each process has independent memory space (no shared state)
    - Subprocess startup overhead makes this slower for small tasks
    - Best for computationally expensive operations (>100ms)
