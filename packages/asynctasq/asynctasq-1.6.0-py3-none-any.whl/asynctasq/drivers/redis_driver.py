    Redis-py has inline types but they're incomplete/incorrect for asyncio.
    This helper checks if the result is awaitable and awaits it if so.

    Note on Type Stubs:
        redis-py defines EncodableT = Union[bytes, bytearray, memoryview, str, int, float]
        but some command stubs incorrectly narrow parameters to just `str`:
        - lrem(value: str) should be lrem(value: EncodableT)

        Runtime behavior is correct - these commands accept bytes when decode_responses=False.
        We use `# type: ignore[arg-type]` for these known redis-py type stub bugs.

    Architecture:
        - Immediate tasks: Redis List at "queue:{name}" (LPUSH/LMOVE for FIFO)
        - Processing tasks: Redis List at "queue:{name}:processing" (in-flight tracking)
        - Delayed tasks: Sorted Set at "queue:{name}:delayed" (score = Unix timestamp)
        - Ready delayed tasks are moved to main queue atomically via pipeline transaction

    Design Decisions:
        - Reliable Queue Pattern: Uses LMOVE to atomically move tasks to processing list
        - Processing list enables crash recovery and prevents nack-after-ack bugs
        - Sorted sets over TTL/Lua: Simpler, atomic, no external dependencies
        - Pipeline with MULTI/EXEC: Prevents duplicate processing during delayed→main transfer
        - RESP3 protocol: Better performance than RESP2 (requires Redis 6.0+)
