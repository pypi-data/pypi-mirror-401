@dataclass
class RabbitMQDriver(BaseDriver):
    """RabbitMQ-based queue driver using AMQP 0.9.1 protocol.

    Architecture:
        - Immediate tasks: Direct exchange with queue (routing_key = queue_name)
        - Delayed tasks: Stored in delayed queue with timestamp, manually processed
        - Receipt handles: Task data bytes mapped to AbstractIncomingMessage for ack/nack
        - Queue caching: Queues are cached in _queues and _delayed_queues dicts
        - Auto-queue creation: Queues are created on-demand when first accessed

    Features:
        - Reliable message delivery with persistent messages
        - Delayed task support using timestamp-based manual processing (no plugins needed)
        - Auto-reconnection with connect_robust for resilience
        - Fair task distribution via prefetch_count=1
        - Message acknowledgments for reliable processing
        - Queue auto-creation on enqueue/dequeue operations
        - Polling support with configurable timeout
        - Queue statistics via get_queue_stats() and get_global_stats()
        - Queue name discovery via get_all_queue_names()

    Design Decisions:
        - Direct exchange pattern: Simple routing (queue_name = routing_key)
        - Delayed task implementation: Timestamp-based manual processing
          - ready_at timestamp encoded as 8-byte double, prepended to message body
          - _process_delayed_tasks() checks timestamps on each dequeue
          - Moves ready messages to main queue, requeues not-ready messages
          - No RabbitMQ plugins required (per-message TTL doesn't auto-expire)
        - Consumer prefetch: Set to 1 for fair distribution across workers
        - Auto-delete queues: False (persistent queues for reliability)
        - Durable queues: True (survive broker restarts)
        - Polling implementation: Manual loop with 100ms intervals (not blocking AMQP)
        - Receipt handle: Uses task data bytes as key (enables idempotent ack/nack)

    AMQP Limitations:
        AMQP protocol doesn't track task metadata (IDs, status, timestamps, worker info).
        The following methods return empty/None/False results due to these limitations:
        - get_running_tasks(): Returns empty list (no task metadata tracking)
        - get_tasks(): Returns empty list (no task history tracking)
        - get_task_by_id(): Returns None (no task ID tracking)
        - retry_task(): Returns False (no failed task tracking)
        - delete_task(): Returns False (no task ID tracking)
        - get_worker_stats(): Returns empty list (no worker tracking)

        For full task tracking capabilities, use a driver with external storage
        (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Redis) or implement a hybrid approach with external
        task metadata storage alongside RabbitMQ for message delivery.

    Requirements:
        - Python 3.11+, aio-pika 9.0+, RabbitMQ server 3.8+
        - No plugins required for delayed messages
