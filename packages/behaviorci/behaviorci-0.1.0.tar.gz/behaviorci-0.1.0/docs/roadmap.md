## v0.2: Diff & Baseline

**Theme**: Compare runs against baselines to detect regressions.

### Features
- [ ] Baseline storage (local JSON files)
- [ ] `behaviorci promote` — Save current run as baseline
- [ ] `behaviorci diff` — Compare run against baseline
- [ ] Diff report showing:
  - New failures
  - Fixed failures
  - Metric changes
- [ ] PR comments integration (GitHub Actions)
- [ ] Markdown diff reports for PRs

### Use Cases
- Detect which cases regressed after a prompt change
- Accept intentional changes by promoting new baseline
- Block PRs that introduce new failures

## v0.3: Policy Packs

**Theme**: Reusable, shareable rule sets for common patterns.

### Features
- [ ] Policy pack specification (YAML)
- [ ] Built-in packs:
  - `safety` — No harmful content indicators
  - `json-only` — Output must be valid JSON
  - `length-limits` — Response length bounds
- [ ] `behaviorci add-failure` — Add failed case to regression suite
- [ ] Failure taxonomies (categorize failures)
- [ ] Custom policy pack authoring

### Use Cases
- Apply standard rules across all bundles
- Share policies across teams
- Automatically grow regression test suite

---

## v0.4: Enhanced Providers

**Theme**: Better provider support and flexibility.

### Features
- [ ] Streaming response support
- [ ] Function calling / tool use testing
- [ ] Local model support (Ollama, llama.cpp)
- [ ] Azure OpenAI adapter
- [ ] Google Vertex AI adapter
- [ ] Custom provider plugin system

---

## v0.5: Advanced Evaluation

**Theme**: Smarter ways to evaluate LLM outputs.

### Features
- [ ] Semantic similarity scoring
- [ ] LLM-as-judge evaluation
- [ ] Expected output comparison
- [ ] Regex pattern matching
- [ ] Custom evaluator plugins

## Future Considerations

### Performance
- Parallel bundle execution
- Result caching
- Incremental runs (only changed bundles)

### Integrations
- GitHub App for native PR integration
- Slack/Discord notifications
- Dashboard UI (optional hosted service)

### Enterprise
- SSO / authentication
- Audit logging
- Role-based access control
- Multi-tenant support
