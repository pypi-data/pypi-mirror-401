## Installation
> [!NOTE]
> - Requires Python 3.11+<br >
> - Requires pip
```bash
pip install plexutil
```

## Configuration
### Required
Set the host, port, token of your plex server
> [!CAUTION]
> Plexutil only works on the same machine the media library is attached to.<br >

```bash
plexutil config -host <PLEX_SERVER_HOST> -port <PLEX_SERVER_PORT> -token <PLEX_SERVER_TOKEN>
```
### Optional
#### TV Series Language Override
To override the language of tv series, modify the tv_language_manifest.json file found in: [Config Location](#config-location) <br >
The file can be modified like such:
```bash
{
  "es-ES": [327417,396583,388477,292262,282670,274522],
  "en-US": []
}
```
Where the key is the language and the list contains the [TVDB](https://www.thetvdb.com/) ids of the desired series to be overriden <br >
For a list of supported languages: [Language](./src/plexutil/enums/language.py)

#### Library Preferences
Libraries of type:
- Movie
- Music
- TV

Can have their preferences set in the following files:

- movie_library_preferences.json
- music_library_preferences.json
- tv_library_preferences.json

These files can be found here: [Config Location](#config-location) <br >
> [!NOTE]
> - These Preferences are set at library creation time <br >
> - The files already include default preferences that can be removed/modified/added based on your needs <br >


#### Server Setting Preferences
These preferences modify the behavior of the server

- plex_server_setting_preferences.json

The file can be found here: [Config Location](#config-location) <br ><br >
For example:
```json
"ButlerStartHour": 23,
```
Starts scheduled tasks at 11:00PM local time, to modify this time to 1:00AM
```json
"ButlerStartHour": 1,
```
These modifications need to be set with:
```bash
plexutil set_server_settings
```
The file already includes default preferences that can be removed/modified/added based on your needs <br >

## Usage
### Creating a media library:
> [!NOTE]
> If language is not supplied, the default is en-US
```bash
plexutil create_movie_library -libn <NAME_OF_THE_LIBRARY> -loc </PATH/TO/MEDIA/LOCATION> -l <LANGUAGE>
```
---

### Deleting a media library:
```bash
plexutil delete_movie_library -libn <NAME_OF_THE_LIBRARY>
```
---

### Creating a Playlist
> [!NOTE]
> Only Music Playlists are currently supported
```bash
plexutil create_music_playlist -libn <LIBRARY_NAME_WHERE_PLAYLIST_IS> -pn <NAME_OF_THE_PLAYLIST> -s /path/to/song.mp3 /path/to/another-song.mp3
```
> [!NOTE]
> The paths passed to -s must match the location of the library <br >
> Therefore, if the library has for location /media/music these song paths must be in /media/music/song.mp3

---

### Deleting a Playlist
> [!NOTE]
> Only Music Playlists are currently supported
```bash
plexutil delete_music_playlist -libn <LIBRARY_NAME_WHERE_PLAYLIST_IS> -pn <NAME_OF_THE_PLAYLIST>
```

---

### Adding songs to a Playlist

```bash
plexutil add_songs_to_music_playlist -libn <LIBRARY_NAME_WHERE_PLAYLIST_IS> -pn <NAME_OF_THE_PLAYLIST> -s /path/to/song.mp3 /path/to/another-song.mp3
```
> [!NOTE]
> The paths passed to -s must match the location of the library <br >
> Therefore, if the library has for location /media/music these song paths must be in /media/music/song.mp3

---

### Exporting/Importing Music Playlists
Music Playlists can be exported to a playlists.db file, this file can later be imported to another Plex server with plexutil
```bash
plexutil export_music_playlist -libn <LIBRARY_NAME_WHERE_PLAYLISTS_ARE>
```
This action will create a playlists.db file here: [Config Location](#config-location) <br >
This file can then be used to recreate the playlists in another Plex Server with plexutil by doing
```bash
plexutil import_music_playlist -libn <LIBRARY_NAME_WHERE_PLAYLISTS_ARE>
```
> [!NOTE]
> The songs in the Music Library of the importing server must match the songs in the exporting server
