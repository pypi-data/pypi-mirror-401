This module enhances Odoo's email communication with branding
capabilities.

**Key Features:**

- **Comprehensive Email Branding:** Automatically applies branding to
  outgoing emails. This includes:

  - Displaying the correct brand logo, derived from the linked partner's
    image.
  - Setting the sender's company details (website, address, phone
    number) according to the selected brand's information.

- **Website Contextualization:** Dynamically adjusts the base URL for
  links within emails to reflect the website associated with a selected
  brand.

- **Brand Selection in Email compose wizard:** Extends the standard
  "Compose Email" wizard with a 'Brand' selection field. This allows
  users to explicitly apply a brand to outgoing emails, particularly
  useful when the originating record isn't directly linked to a brand.

- **Dynamic Logo Delivery:** Includes a custom controller to serve the
  appropriate brand logo in emails based on the selected brand context.

Use Cases / Context
===================

**In summary:**

The module prioritizes automatic branding based on the originating
record. If no brand is associated with the record, or if you need to
override it, you can manually select a brand in the "Compose Email"
wizard. Ensure your brands are correctly configured with linked partners
and logos for the branding to appear in your outgoing emails.

Usage
=====

**1. Defining Brands:**

- Navigate to **Contacts > Brands**.

- Create new brand records. For each brand, you can:

  - **Partner:** Link the brand to an existing partner (company). The
    logo displayed in emails will be derived from the image of this
    partner. Ensure the partner has a logo uploaded (visible in the
    contact form).
  - **Website:** Optionally specify a website URL associated with the
    brand. This URL may be used for links in emails.

**2. Automatic Email Branding (Based on Originating Record):**

- When sending emails from records that have a ``brand_id`` field
  populated (e.g., Sales Orders, Invoices, or other relevant models),
  the module will automatically attempt to use the branding associated
  with that record's brand.
- The email will display the logo of the linked brand, and any company
  details (website, address, phone number) in the email footer should
  correspond to the brand's partner information.

**3. Manual Brand Selection (Using the Compose Email Wizard):**

- When composing a new email (e.g., via the "Send message" button in the
  chatter or through other email actions), a **Brand** field will be
  available in the "Compose Email" wizard. ( The brand field is only
  available in the full view of the compose wizard. )

- Usefull if the originating record does not have a ``brand_id`` set, or
  if you want to use a different brand for this specific email:

     1. Open the "Compose Email" wizard.
     2. In the wizard form, select the desired brand from the **Brand**
        dropdown field.
     3. Compose your email content as usual.
     4. Click **Send**.

- The email sent will then use the logo and company details associated
  with the brand you selected in the wizard.

**4. Website Links in Emails:**

- If a website is defined for the selected brand, the module may use
  this website URL for any relevant links included in the email.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

- If the brand module gets implemented more broadly this module could
  need extension to work properly, because not all odoo modules use the
  same mail templates
- Color the buttons & other elements in the email according to brand
  style.
