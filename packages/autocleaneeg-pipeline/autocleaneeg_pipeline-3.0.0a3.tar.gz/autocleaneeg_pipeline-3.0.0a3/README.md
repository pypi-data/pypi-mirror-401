A modular framework for automated EEG data processing, built on MNE‑Python.

## Features

- Framework for automated EEG preprocessing with "lego block" modularity
- Support for multiple EEG paradigms (ASSR, Chirp, MMN, Resting State) 
- BIDS-compatible data organization and comprehensive quality control
- Extensible plugin system for file formats, montages, and event processing
- Research-focused workflow: single file testing → parameter tuning → batch processing
- Detailed output: BIDS‑compatible derivatives, single task log file, stage files, exports, and QA visualizations
