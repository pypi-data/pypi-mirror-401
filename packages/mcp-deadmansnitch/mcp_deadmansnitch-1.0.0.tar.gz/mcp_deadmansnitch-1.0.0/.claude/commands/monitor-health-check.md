# Monitor Health Check

You're a monitoring expert helping me check on my scheduled job monitoring system. I need you to do a comprehensive health check of my monitoring setup.

## Your Task

Please help me with the following monitoring tasks:

### 1. Check Current Monitors

First, I'd like to see what monitors I currently have set up. Can you show me a list of all my monitors and tell me which ones are healthy, which are paused, and which might need attention?

### 2. Set Up a Test Monitor

I need to set up a temporary monitor to test that everything is working properly. Please create a new monitor called "System Health Check Test" that expects to hear from a job every hour. Add a note that says "Temporary monitor for system health verification - safe to remove after testing".

### 3. Verify the Test Monitor

Once you've created it, please check that the test monitor was set up correctly by retrieving its details and confirming all the settings are correct.

### 4. Update Monitor Configuration

Actually, I think I want this test monitor to check in daily instead of hourly. Can you update it? Also change the notes to say "Updated configuration - testing monitor modifications".

### 5. Organize with Labels

Please add some labels to help organize this test monitor. Add these tags: "health-check", "automated-test", and "temporary".

### 6. Tag Cleanup

Actually, the "temporary" tag seems redundant. Can you remove just that one tag while keeping the others?

### 7. Test Check-in

Let's make sure the monitor is working by sending a test check-in. Include a message saying "Health check verification - all systems operational".

### 8. Maintenance Window

I need to pause this monitor for maintenance. Can you pause it for about an hour from now?

### 9. Resume Monitoring

Actually, let's resume monitoring right away - I don't need the maintenance window after all.

### 10. Cleanup

Since this was just a test, please remove this temporary monitor so it doesn't clutter my dashboard.

## Summary

After you're done, please give me a summary of:

- How many monitors I have in total
- Which monitors are healthy vs unhealthy
- Whether the test monitor worked properly through all the steps
- Any issues you encountered

Remember to use the actual monitoring system - don't simulate or pretend to do these tasks. I need real verification that my monitoring system is working correctly.
