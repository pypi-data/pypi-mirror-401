This package allows you to turn images (only `.jpg` and `.png` tested) into ASCII art drawings.<br/>
Inspired by [ascii-view](https://github.com/gouwsxander/ascii-view/tree/main).
# Documentation
Full documentation is available at:
**[asciify-them.readthedocs.io](https://asciify-them.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**

# Features
- **CLI**: This software can be accessed both as a Python library and as a CLI;
- **Colored output**: ANSI color codes allow to print colors (requires a modern terminal);
- **Resizing flexibility**: Images are scaled to keep aspect ratio and fit the image to the terminal, but both options can be disabled;
- **Edge detection**: Sobel and Canny algorithm are used to highlight edges;
- **Output flexibility**: Resulting images can be saved in a file (both using the terminal to determine optimal size or providing custom height and/or width).

# Installation
The package can be installed through PyPi:<br/>
```
# using pip
pip install asciify-them

# or using uv
uv tool install asciify-them
```
But also from source:
```
git clone https://github.com/ndrscalia/asciify-them
cd <repo-dir>
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```
The software can also be used without installing it through uv:
```
uvx --from asciify-them asciify path/to/image [OPTIONS]
```
# Usage
This package requires a terminal emulator with true color support (e.g. kitty, alacritty, iTerm2).
## CLI
The only required argument is the path to the image:
```
asciify <path/to/image> [OPTIONS]
```
The following options are available:
- `-bw, --black_white`: Set the output to black&white.
- `-e, --edges`: Enable edge detection.
- `-w, --width`: Provide custom width. If not specified, terminal's size is going to determine this value. This value can be specified only when `f_type='wide'`.
- `-he, --height`: Provide custom height. If not specified, terminal's size is going to determine this value. This value can be specified only when `f_type='tall'`.
- `-ar, --no_aspect_ratio`: Disable original aspect ratio's protection.
- `-f, --factor_type`: Choose the downsampling factor type among the following values: `in_terminal`, `wide`, `tall`.
- `-b, --blur`: Provide a list with kernel size as a tuple, std for x axis, std for y axis. For more details refere to the docs for `cv2.GaussianBlur`. Changing the dafault values allow to tweak edge detection.
- `ct, --canny_threshold`: Provide edges detection threshold as a tuple. For more details refer to the docs for `cv2.Canny`.
- `-at, --angles_threshold`: Provide kernel size for angles calculation as an integer.
- `-o, --output`: Provide the output's path. If not specified, uses stdout (e.g.: terminal).
- `-A, --aspect_ratio_correction`: Provide the value by witch to divide the terminal's detected aspect ratio to account for line spacing.

### Details
The different factors available are meant for different scenarios:
- `in_terminal` allows to keep the output inside the terminal keeping aspect ratio;
- `wide` is better suited for images which are wider than taller but the output does not stay in the terminal. This option is also optimal for conversion to `.png` through [ansee](https://github.com/codersauce/ansee), regardless of the relation between height and width;
- `tall` is better suited for images which are taller than wider but the output does not stay in the terminal;
If aspect ratio's protection is disabled, output will be squished by a factor to stay in the terminal.
## Python library
This package can also be used as a python library. Most of the API is exposed to the user, but a convenient wrapper is also available for simpler use cases.
```python
from asciify import asciify

# Minimal use
result = asciify("path/to/image")
print(result)

# More advanced use
result = asciify(
    "path/to/image",
    color_mode="bw",
    edges_detection=True,
    f_type="tall",
    aspect_ratio_correction=1.20
)

with open("output.txt", "w") as f:
    f.write(result)
```
The `.txt` output can be used with `ansee` to get a `.png` file out of it.<br/>
If needed, the core classes can be used as follows:
```python
from asciify import ImgeProcessor, Renderer, DEFAULT_CHARSET

processor = ImgProcessor(image_path)

if not height and not width:
    term_height, term_width = processor.calculate_print_size()
else:
    term_height, term_width = height, width

ds_f = processor.calculate_downsample_factor(
    term_height=term_height,
    term_width=term_width,
    keep_aspect_ratio=keep_aspect_ratio,
    f_type=f_type
)

ds_img = processor.downsample_image(
    f=ds_f,
    keep_aspect_ratio=keep_aspect_ratio,
    aspect_ratio_correction=1.10
)

img_hsv = processor.convert_to_hsv(image=ds_img)

angles = processor.calculate_angles(
    image=ds_img,
    k_size=angles_thresh
)

edges = processor.detect_edges(
    image=ds_img,
    blur=blur,
    canny_thresh=canny_thresh
)

renderer = Renderer(
    color_mode=color_mode,
    charset=DEFAULT_CHARSET
)

if edges_detection:
    return renderer.draw_in_ascii_with_edges(img_hsv=img_hsv, angles=angles, edges=edges)
else:
    return renderer.draw_in_ascii(img_hsv=img_hsv)
```
