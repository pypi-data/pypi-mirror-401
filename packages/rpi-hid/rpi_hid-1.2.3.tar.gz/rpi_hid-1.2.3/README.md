# RPI-HID — Raspberry Pi USB HID Automation Library

RPI-HID is a Python library that allows a **Raspberry Pi Zero / Zero 2 W** to act as a **USB Human Interface Device (HID)**, emulating a keyboard to automate keystrokes on a connected system.

It provides a **high-level API** and an **advanced Rubber Ducky–style interpreter**, abstracting low-level HID report handling into clean, reusable Python functions.

---

## Features

- USB HID **keyboard emulation** using Linux USB gadget mode
- High-level keyboard control API
- Advanced **Rubber Ducky–style script execution**
- Configurable typing delays and pauses
- Auto-run payload support using `systemd`
- Clean, modular, and extensible architecture
- Published and installable from **PyPI**

---

## Supported Hardware

- Raspberry Pi Zero
- Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

> ⚠️ Other Raspberry Pi models (3/4/5) do not support USB gadget mode.

---

## Requirements

- Raspberry Pi OS (Lite recommended)
- Python ≥ 3.7
- USB OTG enabled (`dwc2`, `libcomposite`)
- Root access (required for `/dev/hidg0`)

---

## Installation

```bash
pip install rpi-hid
```

---

## Quick Start

```python
from rpi_hid import Keyboard

kbd = Keyboard()
kbd.winRun("notepad")
kbd.type("Hello from RPI-HID")
kbd.enter()
kbd.close()
```

---

## Keyboard API

### `type(text: str)`

Types the given string.

```python
kbd.type("Hello World")
```

---

### `press(*keys)`

Presses a key or key combination.

```python
kbd.press("ENTER")
kbd.press("CTRL", "c")
kbd.press("GUI", "r")
```

---

### `pause(seconds: float)`

Pauses execution.

```python
kbd.pause(1.5)
```

---

### `winRun(command: str)`

Opens the Windows Run dialog and executes a command.

```python
kbd.winRun("cmd")
```

---

### `spamText(text: str, n: int = 10)`

Types a string multiple times.

```python
kbd.spamText("TEST ", 5)
```

---

## Rubber Ducky Script Support

RPI-HID includes a **DuckyScript interpreter** with near Rubber Ducky v1 compatibility.

### Supported Commands

* `STRING`
* `DELAY`
* `DEFAULT_DELAY`
* `STRING_DELAY`
* `ENTER`, `TAB`, `SPACE`, `ESC`
* Modifier combos (`CTRL`, `ALT`, `SHIFT`, `GUI`)
* `REPEAT`
* `HOLD`, `RELEASE`
* `REM`

### Example Ducky Script

```text
REM Demo payload
DEFAULT_DELAY 200
GUI r
STRING notepad
ENTER
STRING Hello from DuckyScript
ENTER
```

### Execute Script

```python
from rpi_hid import DuckyInterpreter

duck = DuckyInterpreter()
duck.run_file("payload.ducky")
duck.close()
```

---

## Permissions Note

HID device access requires root privileges.
When using a virtual environment, always run scripts using the venv Python binary:

```bash
sudo venv/bin/python script.py
```
