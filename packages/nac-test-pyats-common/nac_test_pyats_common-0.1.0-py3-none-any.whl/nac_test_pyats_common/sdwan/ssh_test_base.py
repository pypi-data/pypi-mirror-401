"""SD-WAN specific base test class for SSH/Direct-to-Device testing.

This module provides the SDWANTestBase class, which extends the generic SSHTestBase
to add SD-WAN-specific functionality for device-to-device (D2D) testing.

The class delegates device inventory resolution to SDWANDeviceResolver, which
handles all SD-WAN schema navigation and credential injection.

Credentials:
    SD-WAN D2D tests connect to IOS-XE based edge devices, NOT the SDWAN Manager
    controller. Set these environment variables:
    - IOSXE_USERNAME: SSH username for edge devices
    - IOSXE_PASSWORD: SSH password for edge devices

    Credentials:
