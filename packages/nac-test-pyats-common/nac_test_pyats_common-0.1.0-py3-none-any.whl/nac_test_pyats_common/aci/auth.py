"""APIC authentication module for Cisco ACI (Application Centric Infrastructure).

This module provides authentication functionality for Cisco APIC (Application Policy
Infrastructure Controller), which is the central management and policy enforcement
point for ACI fabric. The authentication mechanism uses REST API calls to obtain
session tokens that are valid for a limited time period.

The module implements a two-tier API design:
1. authenticate() - Low-level method that performs direct APIC authentication
2. get_token() - High-level method that leverages caching for efficient token reuse

This design ensures efficient token management by reusing valid tokens and only
re-authenticating when necessary, reducing unnecessary API calls to the APIC controller.

class APICAuth:
    """APIC-specific authentication implementation with token caching.

    This class provides a two-tier API for APIC authentication:

    1. Low-level authenticate() method: Directly authenticates with APIC and returns
       a token along with its expiration time. This is typically used by the caching
       layer and not called directly by consumers.

    2. High-level get_token() method: Provides cached token management, automatically
       handling token renewal when expired. This is the primary method that consumers
       should use for obtaining APIC tokens.

    The two-tier design ensures efficient token reuse across multiple API calls while
    maintaining clean separation between authentication logic and caching concerns.
