"""APIC-specific base test class for ACI API testing.

This module provides the APICTestBase class, which extends the generic NACTestBase
to add ACI-specific functionality for testing APIC controllers. It handles
authentication, client management, and provides a standardized interface for
running asynchronous verification tests against ACI fabrics.

The class integrates with PyATS/Genie test frameworks and provides automatic
API call tracking for enhanced HTML reporting.

    """Base class for APIC API tests with enhanced reporting.

    This class extends the generic NACTestBase to provide APIC-specific
    functionality including APIC authentication token management, API call
    tracking for HTML reports, and wrapped HTTP client for automatic response
    capture. It serves as the foundation for all ACI-specific test classes.

    Attributes:
        token (str): APIC authentication token obtained during setup.
        client (httpx.AsyncClient): Wrapped async HTTP client configured for APIC.
        controller_url (str): Base URL of the APIC controller (inherited).
        username (str): APIC username for authentication (inherited).
        password (str): APIC password for authentication (inherited).

    Methods:
        setup(): Initialize APIC authentication and client.
        get_apic_client(): Create and configure an APIC-specific HTTP client.
        run_async_verification_test(): Execute async verification tests with PyATS.

    Example:
        class MyAPICTest(APICTestBase):
            async def get_items_to_verify(self):
                return ['tenant1', 'tenant2']

        3. Creating and storing an APIC client for use in verification methods

        manages token lifecycle and prevents duplicate authentication requests
        across parallel test execution.
