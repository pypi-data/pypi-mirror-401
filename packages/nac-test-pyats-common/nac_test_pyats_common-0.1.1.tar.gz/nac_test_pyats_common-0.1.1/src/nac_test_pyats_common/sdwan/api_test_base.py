"""SDWAN Manager-specific base test class for SD-WAN API testing.

This module provides the SDWANManagerTestBase class, which extends the generic
NACTestBase to add SDWAN Manager-specific functionality for testing SD-WAN
controllers. It handles session management (JSESSIONID and XSRF token), client
configuration, and provides a standardized interface for running asynchronous
verification tests against SDWAN Manager.

The class integrates with PyATS/Genie test frameworks and provides automatic
API call tracking for enhanced HTML reporting.

    """Base class for SDWAN Manager API tests with enhanced reporting.

    This class extends the generic NACTestBase to provide SDWAN Manager-specific
    functionality including session management (JSESSIONID and optional XSRF token),
    API call tracking for HTML reports, and wrapped HTTP client for automatic
    response capture. It serves as the foundation for all SD-WAN controller-specific
    API test classes.

    The class follows the same pattern as APICTestBase for consistency across
    NAC architecture adapters. Token refresh is handled automatically by the
    AuthCache TTL mechanism.

    Attributes:
        auth_data (dict): SDWAN Manager authentication data containing jsessionid and
            optional xsrf_token obtained during setup.
        client (httpx.AsyncClient | None): Wrapped async HTTP client configured for
            SDWAN Manager. Initialized to None, set during setup().
        controller_url (str): Base URL of the SDWAN Manager (inherited).
        username (str): SDWAN Manager username for authentication (inherited).
        password (str): SDWAN Manager password for authentication (inherited).

    Methods:
        setup(): Initialize SDWAN Manager authentication and client.
        get_sdwan_manager_client(): Create and configure an SDWAN Manager-specific
            HTTP client.
        run_async_verification_test(): Execute async verification tests with PyATS.

    Example:
        class MySDWANManagerTest(SDWANManagerTestBase):
            async def get_items_to_verify(self):
                return ['device1', 'device2']
