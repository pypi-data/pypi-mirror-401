# QVAR

Quantum subroutine for VARiance estimation. 

The QVAR quantum subroutine employs a gate-based circuit logarithmic in depth to compute the classical variance of a set of values stored in superposition. This subroutine uses the Amplitude Estimation algorithm to estimate the variance of the indexed values. 

## Installation

```bash
pip install qvar
```

## Features

- Quantum subroutine for variance estimation with logarithmic depth and width
- Easy integration within quantum and hybrid-quantum algorithms
- Several simulation methods available (Amplitude Estimation, Faster Amplitude Estimation, Shots, Statevector simulation)
