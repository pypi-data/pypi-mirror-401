          Maximum size of archives to process, in bytes. Prevents processing very large files.
          Generally, larger files take more time and resources to process. Especially, if
          it's a remote file that needs to be downloaded first.

          Enable caching to improve performance on repeated access.
          Caching can significantly speed up access to frequently used resources.
          It is recommended to enable caching in production environments.
          Note, that caching uses Redis as backend, therefore it takes some memory.

          Threshold for automatically expanding nodes in the UI tree view.
          If the number of nodes is less than or equal to this value, the tree will be fully expanded by default.
          If the number of nodes exceeds this value, the tree will be collapsed by default.
          Set to 0 to always collapse nodes. Expanding too many nodes may impact performance.

      - key: ckanext.unfold.show_context_menu_default
        type: bool
        default: true

          If true, the right click context menu will be enabled by default in the tree view.
          If false, if node contains a link, it can be opened by left clicking on it.
