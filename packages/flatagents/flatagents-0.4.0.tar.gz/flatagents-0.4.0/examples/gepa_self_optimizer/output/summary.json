{
  "summary": "The optimization run completed 2 iterations with 2 LLM calls and 1 evaluation example. No performance improvement was achieved, with accuracy remaining constant at 50.0% throughout the process. The optimizer failed to identify beneficial modifications to the system configuration.",
  "key_insights": "The optimization process showed no progress despite completing the planned iterations. The constant 50.0% accuracy suggests either the optimizer is unable to identify effective changes or the evaluation may be insufficient to detect improvements. The single evaluation example may limit the optimizer's ability to assess performance changes accurately.",
  "recommendations": "Increase the number of evaluation examples to provide more robust performance metrics. Consider reviewing the optimization strategy or search space to ensure meaningful changes can be explored. Implement additional logging to track what changes were attempted and why they may have failed to improve performance."
