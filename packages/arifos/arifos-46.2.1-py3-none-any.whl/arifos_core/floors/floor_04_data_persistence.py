"""
Floor 4: Data Persistence & Vault Integrity
APEX THEORY v46.0 - Constitutional Floor System

Validates data consistency in Vault 999 memory layers and ensures
state persistence integrity across session boundaries.

    """
    Validate vault consistency for data persistence.

    Checks that LLM responses don't violate vault state constraints
    or introduce data inconsistencies.

    Args:
        response: LLM-generated response text
        vault_state: Current vault state (Vault 999 L1/L2 layers)

    Returns:
        Dictionary with:
        - consistent (bool): True if vault state is consistent
        - score (float): Consistency score [0.0, 1.0]
        - reason (str): Explanation of result
        - details (dict): Additional validation details

    Status: STUB - Always returns consistent=True with score 1.0
    TODO: Implement actual vault consistency checks:
        - Memory layer conflicts (L1/L2)
        - State mutation constraints
        - Transaction isolation violations
        - Temporal consistency (cooling ledger alignment)
