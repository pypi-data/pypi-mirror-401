"""
Floor 5: Pattern Recognition & Anomaly Detection
APEX THEORY v46.0 - Constitutional Floor System

Detects anomalous patterns in LLM responses that deviate from
historical behavior, identifying potential security issues,
hallucinations, or constitutional violations.

Status: STUB IMPLEMENTATION (v46.1)

    """
    Detect anomalies in LLM response patterns.

    Compares current response against historical patterns to identify
    deviations that may indicate:
    - Hallucinations (fabricated information)
    - Security violations (injection attempts)
    - Constitutional drift (floor violations)
    - Response quality degradation

    Args:
        response: LLM-generated response text
        historical_patterns: Historical pattern data for comparison

    Returns:
        Dictionary with:
        - anomaly_detected (bool): True if anomaly found
        - anomaly_score (float): Anomaly magnitude [0.0, 1.0]
                                0.0 = normal, 1.0 = severe anomaly
        - description (str): Explanation of detected anomaly
        - details (dict): Additional anomaly metadata

    Status: STUB - Always returns no anomaly (score 0.0)
    TODO: Implement actual anomaly detection:
        - Statistical deviation from historical patterns
        - Embedding distance metrics
        - Response length/structure outliers
        - Forbidden pattern matching (anti-hantu)
        - Hallucination indicators
