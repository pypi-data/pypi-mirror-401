"""
Phoenix-72 Guardrail CI Integration Test

This test runs the Phoenix-72 guardrail checks as part of the test suite,
ensuring constitutional drift and entropy growth are detected in CI.

Test Goals:
1. Detect hardcoded constitutional thresholds (spec sovereignty)
2. Enforce ΔS ≤ 0 constraint (net LOC cannot grow without justification)
3. Fail CI if violations detected
