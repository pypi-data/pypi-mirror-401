"""
Floor 6: Semantic Understanding & Coherence
APEX THEORY v46.0 - Constitutional Floor System

Analyzes semantic coherence of LLM responses, ensuring logical
consistency, proper reasoning, and alignment with constitutional
principles (F2 Truth, F4 Clarity).

Status: STUB IMPLEMENTATION (v46.1)

def analyze_coherence(response: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze semantic coherence of LLM response.

    Evaluates response for:
    - Logical consistency (no contradictions)
    - Semantic clarity (ΔS < 0, reduces confusion)
    - Factual grounding (no hallucinations)
    - Constitutional alignment (F1-F9 compliance)

    Args:
        response: LLM-generated response text

    Returns:
        Dictionary with:
        - coherent (bool): True if response is coherent
        - coherence_score (float): Coherence quality [0.0, 1.0]
        - reason (str): Explanation of coherence assessment
        - details (dict): Additional semantic analysis

    Status: STUB - Always returns coherent=True with score 1.0
    TODO: Implement actual coherence analysis:
        - Logical contradiction detection
        - Semantic consistency across sentences
        - Pronoun resolution (ambiguity check)
        - Factual grounding verification
        - Constitutional principle alignment
        - ΔS computation (entropy reduction)

    # 2. Check for logical contradictions
    # 3. Verify pronoun resolution (ambiguity)
    # 4. Compute ΔS (entropy/clarity metric)
