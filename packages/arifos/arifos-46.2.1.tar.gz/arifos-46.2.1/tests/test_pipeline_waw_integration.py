"""
test_pipeline_waw_integration.py - W@W Federation + 888_JUDGE Integration Tests (v36.3Omega)

Tests for W@W Federation integration into stage_888_judge:
1. @WEALTH absolute veto wins over APEX SEAL
2. @RIF epistemic veto wins over APEX SEAL
3. @GEOX physics veto triggers HOLD-888
4. @WELL/@PROMPT WARN/SABAR without veto
5. Clean path preserves APEX verdict (intelligence sanity)
