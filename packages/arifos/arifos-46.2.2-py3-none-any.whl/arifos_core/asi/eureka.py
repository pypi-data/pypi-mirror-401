"""
EUREKA-777 — Paradox Synthesis Engine

Stage 777 FORGE: Resolves tensions between AGI (truth) and ASI (care).

The EUREKA engine synthesizes coherent responses when cold logic (AGI)
and warm empathy (ASI) produce contradictory assessments.

Example paradox:
- AGI says: "The truth is harsh" (F1 pass, but low Peace²)
- ASI says: "Don't hurt the user" (high Peace², but obscures truth)
- EUREKA resolves: "This is difficult to hear, and it's true: [truth]"

v46 Trinity Orthogonal: EUREKA belongs to ASI (Ω) kernel.
