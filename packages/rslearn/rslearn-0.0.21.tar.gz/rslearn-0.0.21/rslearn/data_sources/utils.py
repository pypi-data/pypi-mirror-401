    We divide the time range of the geometry into shorter periods. Within each period,
    we use the items corresponding to that period to create a mosaic. The returned item
    groups include one group per period, starting from the most recent periods, up to
    the provided max_matches.

    The periods are also bounded to the window's time range, and aligned with the end
    of that time range, i.e. the most recent window is
    (end_time - period_duration, end_time), the next is
    (end_time - 2*period_duration, end_time - period_duration), and so on. Note that
    this means that if the window duration is shorter than the period_duration, there
    will be zero matches.

    This is used e.g. when a model should process three mosaics, where each mosaic
    should come from a different month. This gives more diversity of images, since
    simply searching for the least cloudy images could result in selecting all of the
    images from the same month.

    max_matches may be smaller than the total number of periods in the given time
    range. In this case, we prefer to use mosaics of the most recent periods. However,
    sometimes there may be no items in a period; in that case, the older periods are
    used as a fallback. This means that reducing the window duration down to match
    max_matches*period_duration is not equivalent to a longer window duration.
