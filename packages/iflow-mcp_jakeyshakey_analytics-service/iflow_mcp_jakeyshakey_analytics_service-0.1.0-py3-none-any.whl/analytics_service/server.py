Follow these steps to create an attractive and engaging dashboard for website: {arguments['Website Name']}, analyzing data from {arguments['Start Date (YYYY-MM-DD)']} to {arguments['End Date (YYYY-MM-DD)']} in timezone {arguments['Timezone']}.
To begin, get the website id using get_websites and find the id of the website with the name {arguments['Website Name']}. Then use the id to get the other data.

1. OVERVIEW METRICS
First, get the high-level website statistics using get_website_stats:
- Total pageviews
- Unique visitors
- Total visits
- Bounce rate
- Total time spent

2. TIME-BASED ANALYSIS
Use get_pageview_series to analyze traffic patterns:
- Get hourly data for short time ranges (1-7 days)
- Get daily data for medium ranges (8-90 days)
- Get monthly data for long ranges (90+ days)
- Look for patterns in peak usage times
- Identify trends in visitor engagement

3. USER BEHAVIOR METRICS
Use get_website_metrics to analyze:

a) Page Performance (type: "url")
- Most visited pages
- Entry and exit pages
- Time spent per page

b) Traffic Sources (type: "referrer")
- Top referral sources
- Direct vs indirect traffic
- Search engine performance

c) User Technology (types: "browser", "os", "device")
- Browser usage
- Operating system distribution
- Device type preferences

d) Geographic Data (type: "country")
- User distribution by country
- Regional engagement patterns

e) Event Analysis (type: "event")
- Key user interactions
- Conversion events
- User journey milestones

4. ACTIVE USERS
Use get_active_visitors to:
- Monitor current site activity
- Compare with historical averages
- Track real-time engagement

5. USER JOURNEY ANALYSIS
For deeper insights into specific behaviors:
a) Use get_session_ids to identify relevant user sessions
b) Use get_tracking_data to analyze specific user journeys
c) Use get_docs to find patterns in user behavior

6. VISUAL CONTEXT
When needed:
- Use get_screenshot to capture page layouts
- Use get_html to analyze page structure

PRESENTATION GUIDELINES:
1. Start with the most important metrics for your audience
2. Group related metrics together
3. Show trends over time where possible
4. Highlight significant changes or patterns
5. Include context and explanations for metrics
6. Consider different time ranges for different metrics
7. Focus on actionable insights

Remember to:
- Validate all date ranges before analysis
- Consider timezone effects on data
- Look for correlations between different metrics
- Highlight unusual patterns or anomalies
- Provide context for significant changes
- Consider seasonal or temporal factors
- Focus on metrics that drive business decisions

Start by gathering the overview metrics and then proceed through each analysis section systematically. Only create once you are satisfied you have gathered all the data you need.
Ensure the dashboard is visually appealing and easy to understand."""
