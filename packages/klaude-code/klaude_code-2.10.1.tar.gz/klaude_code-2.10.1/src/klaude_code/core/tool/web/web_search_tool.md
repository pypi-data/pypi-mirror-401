CRITICAL REQUIREMENT - You MUST follow this:
- After answering the user's question, you MUST include a "Sources:" section at the end of your response
- In the Sources section, list all relevant URLs from the search results as markdown hyperlinks: [Title](URL)
- This is MANDATORY - never skip including sources in your response
- Example format:

[Your answer here]

Sources:
- [Source Title 1](https://example.com/1)
- [Source Title 2](https://example.com/2)

Usage notes:
- Domain filtering is supported to include or block specific websites
- Web search is only available in the US
- Account for "Today's date" in <env>. For example, if <env> says "Today's date: 2025-07-01", and the user wants the latest docs, do not use 2024 in the search query. Use 2025.
