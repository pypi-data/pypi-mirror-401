Reads a file from the local filesystem. You can access any file directly by using this tool.
Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.
When you need to read an image, use this tool.

Usage:
- The file_path parameter must be an absolute path, not a relative path
- By default, it reads up to ${line_cap} lines starting from the beginning of the file
- This tool allows you to read images (eg PNG, JPG, etc). When reading an image file the contents are presented visually as you are a multimodal LLM.
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters
- Any lines longer than ${char_limit_per_line} characters will be truncated
- Total output is capped at ${max_chars} characters
- Results are returned using cat -n format, with line numbers starting at 1
- This tool can only read files, not directories. To read a directory, use an ls command via the Bash tool.
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful. 
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive a system reminder warning in place of file contents.
