class DisplayABC(ABC):
    """
    Abstract base class for UI display implementations.

    A Display is responsible for rendering events from the executor to the user.
    Implementations can range from minimal text output to rich interactive
    terminals (TUIDisplay) or debugging wrappers (DebugEventDisplay).

    Lifecycle:
        1. start() is called once before any events are consumed.
        2. consume_event() is called for each event from the executor.
        3. stop() is called once when the display is shutting down (after EndEvent).

    Typical Usage:
        # See klaude_code.tui.display.TUIDisplay for the interactive terminal frontend.
        await display.consume_event_loop(event_queue)

        # Or manually:
        await display.start()
        try:
            async for event in events:
                if isinstance(event, EndEvent):
                    break
                await display.consume_event(event)
        finally:
            await display.stop()

    Thread Safety:
        Display implementations should be used from a single async task.
        The consume_event_loop method handles the standard event loop pattern.
    """

    @abstractmethod
    async def consume_event(self, event: events.Event) -> None:
        """
        Process a single event from the executor.

        This method is called for each event except EndEvent, which triggers stop().
        Implementations should handle all relevant event types and render them
        appropriately for the user.

        Args:
            event: The event to process. See klaude_code.protocol.events for types.

        that needs to happen before rendering begins (e.g., initializing

        Clean up the display after all events have been processed.
