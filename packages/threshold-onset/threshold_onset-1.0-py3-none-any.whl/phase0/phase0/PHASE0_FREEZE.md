# THRESHOLD_ONSET — Phase 0 Freeze Declaration

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Status:** ✅ **FROZEN FOREVER**

## Phase 0 Freeze Declaration

Phase 0 (THRESHOLD_ONSET) is hereby declared **FROZEN FOREVER**. It has met all criteria for immutability and will not be modified further.

---

## Properties

- **Action → residue proven**
- **Pure action without knowledge**
- **Opaque, structureless residues**
- **No interpretation, no meaning**
- **No symbols, no labels, no names**
- **Canonical outputs only:**
  - Total residue count
  - Unique residue count
  - Collision rate

---

## Freeze Criteria Met

1. **Action exists without knowledge:**
   - Confirmed: Actions produce residues without interpretation
   - Evidence: Pure numeric outputs, no semantic content

2. **Canonical outputs limited:**
   - Confirmed: Only three outputs (count, unique count, collision rate)
   - Evidence: No visualization, no statistics, no interpretation

3. **Phase 0 compliance:**
   - Confirmed: No forbidden concepts (symbols, labels, meaning, interpretation)
   - Evidence: Code audit passed, all violations removed

4. **Stability:**
   - Confirmed: Phase 0 logic is stable and deterministic
   - Evidence: Consistent outputs across runs

---

## Locked Components (FROZEN)

The following components of Phase 0 are now locked and must not be modified:

- **Phase 0 pipeline:** `src/phase0/phase0.py`
- **Action variants:** `src/phase0/actions.py`
- **Canonical output logic:** Total count, unique count, collision rate only
- **All constraints:** No symbols, labels, meaning, interpretation, visualization

---

## Impact on Later Phases

**Phase 1 (SEGMENTATION) is UNBLOCKED.**

- Phase 1 execution is legally allowed.
- Phase 1 must strictly adhere to its own axioms, ensuring segmentation without naming.

---

## Signature

This document serves as the immutable record of Phase 0's completion and freeze.

**Removing Phase 0 would break the entire system. Phase 0 is the foundation.**
