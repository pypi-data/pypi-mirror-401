# THRESHOLD_ONSET — Phase 1 Freeze Declaration

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Status:** ✅ **FROZEN FOREVER**

## Phase 1 Freeze Declaration

Phase 1 (SEGMENTATION) is hereby declared **FROZEN FOREVER**. It has met all criteria for immutability and will not be modified further.

---

## Properties

- **Segmentation without naming**
- **Boundary detection (indices only)**
- **Difference measurement (raw numbers)**
- **Clustering (counts only)**
- **Pattern detection (counts only)**
- **Structural metrics (numbers/indices only)**
- **No names, labels, symbols, interpretation**
- **No visualization, adaptive thresholds, real-time logs**

---

## Freeze Criteria Met

1. **Segmentation exists without identity:**
   - Confirmed: Boundaries detected without naming
   - Evidence: Indices only, no labels

2. **Structural metrics only:**
   - Confirmed: Counts, distances, clusters (numbers only)
   - Evidence: No interpretation, no meaning

3. **Phase 1 compliance:**
   - Confirmed: No forbidden concepts (names, labels, symbols, interpretation)
   - Evidence: Code audit passed, all constraints respected

4. **Stability:**
   - Confirmed: Phase 1 logic is stable and deterministic
   - Evidence: Consistent outputs across runs

---

## Locked Components (FROZEN)

The following components of Phase 1 are now locked and must not be modified:

- **Phase 1 pipeline:** `src/phase1/phase1.py`
- **Boundary detection:** `src/phase1/boundary.py`
- **Clustering logic:** `src/phase1/cluster.py`
- **Distance measurement:** `src/phase1/distance.py`
- **Pattern detection:** `src/phase1/pattern.py`
- **All fixed thresholds:** No adaptive thresholds allowed

---

## Impact on Later Phases

**Phase 2 (IDENTITY) is UNBLOCKED.**

- Phase 2 execution is legally allowed.
- Phase 2 must strictly adhere to its own axioms, ensuring identity without naming.

---

## Signature

This document serves as the immutable record of Phase 1's completion and freeze.

**Removing Phase 1 would break Phase 2 and later phases. Phase 1 is foundational.**
