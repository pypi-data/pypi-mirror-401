THRESHOLD_ONSET — Phase 2: IDENTITY

Identity without naming.
Persistence measurement without meaning.
Repeatable units without symbols.
Identity hashes (internal only, not symbolic).

Phase 2 operates as separate layer from Phase 0 and Phase 1.
Reads Phase 0 and Phase 1 output only. Does not modify them.
