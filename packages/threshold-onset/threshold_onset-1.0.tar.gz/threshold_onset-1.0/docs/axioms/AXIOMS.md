# AXIOMS

## Layer 0 — NON-NEGOTIABLE AXIOM (top of everything)

कार्य (kārya) happens before ज्ञान (jñāna)

Function stabilizes before knowledge appears.

This is not philosophy.
This is a design constraint.

Anything that violates this → not allowed in Phase 0.

---

## Layer 1 — THRESHOLD_ONSET (scope boundary)

### Only this is allowed:

- action
- interaction
- trace
- repetition
- persistence
- stabilization

### Explicitly NOT allowed:

- symbols
- letters
- meaning
- tokens
- embeddings
- plots
- coordinates

**This layer must be code-enforced, not just written.**

---

## Layer 2 — What Phase 0 produces (outputs, not goals)

Phase 0 produces ONLY:

- traces
- patterns of survival
- invariants under repetition

It does not produce:

- symbols
- IDs
- names
- interpretations

**If your code returns anything interpretable → it's wrong.**

---

## Layer 3 — Why letters are NOT in Phase 0

This is important for your sanity.

Your A / B stroke work is correct, but:

👉 **Letters belong to Phase 1 or Phase 2, NOT Phase 0**

Because letters already assume:

- segmentation
- identity
- repeatable units

If you bring letters into Phase 0, you violate THRESHOLD_ONSET.

**This is the biggest trap.**

---

## Layer 4 — Phase 0 → Phase 1 Transition

### Phase 0 Status
**FROZEN PERMANENTLY**

Phase 0 is:
- ✅ Implemented
- ✅ Verified
- ✅ Complete
- 🔒 **Frozen - cannot be modified**

### Phase 1 Definition
**Segmentation without naming**

Phase 1 allows:
- Boundary detection (indices only)
- Clustering (counts only)
- Distance measurement (raw numbers)
- Pattern detection (counts only)

Phase 1 forbids:
- Names, labels, symbols
- Interpretation, meaning
- Classification, categorization
- Visualization, plots

### Transition Rules
See `docs/PHASE1_TRANSITION.md` for complete transition specification.

**Key Rule:** Phase 0 remains frozen. Phase 1 operates as separate layer.
