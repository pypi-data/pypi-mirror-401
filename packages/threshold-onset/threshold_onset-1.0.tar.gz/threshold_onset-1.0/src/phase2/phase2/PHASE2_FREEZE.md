# THRESHOLD_ONSET — Phase 2 Freeze Declaration

**Date:** 2026-01-14
**Status:** ✅ **FROZEN FOREVER**

## Phase 2 Freeze Declaration

Phase 2 (IDENTITY) is hereby declared **FROZEN FOREVER**. It has met all criteria for immutability and will not be modified further.

---

## Properties

- **Identity without naming**
- **Persistence measurement (counts only)**
- **Repeatable unit detection (counts only)**
- **Identity hash generation (internal only)**
- **Stability metrics (counts only)**
- **Identity assignment (hash-based, internal only)**
- **No symbolic naming, linguistic labels, meaning, interpretation**
- **No visualization, adaptive thresholds, real-time logs**

---

## Freeze Criteria Met

1. **Identity exists without naming:**
   - Confirmed: Persistent identities detected without labels
   - Evidence: Hash-based internal identifiers only

2. **Multi-run persistence:**
   - Confirmed: Identities survive across multiple independent runs
   - Evidence: Persistent segments and identity mappings stable

3. **Phase 2 compliance:**
   - Confirmed: No forbidden concepts (symbolic naming, linguistic labels, meaning)
   - Evidence: Code audit passed, all constraints respected

4. **Stability:**
   - Confirmed: Phase 2 logic is stable and deterministic
   - Evidence: Consistent outputs across runs, multi-run mode validated

---

## Locked Components (FROZEN)

The following components of Phase 2 are now locked and must not be modified:

- **Phase 2 pipeline:** `src/phase2/phase2.py`
- **Persistence measurement:** `src/phase2/persistence.py`
- **Repeatable units:** `src/phase2/repeatable.py`
- **Identity assignment:** `src/phase2/identity.py`
- **Stability metrics:** `src/phase2/stability.py`
- **All fixed thresholds:** No adaptive thresholds allowed

---

## Impact on Later Phases

**Phase 3 (RELATION) is UNBLOCKED.**

- Phase 3 execution is legally allowed.
- Phase 3 must strictly adhere to its own axioms, ensuring relation without naming.

---

## Signature

This document serves as the immutable record of Phase 2's completion and freeze.

**Removing Phase 2 would break Phase 3 and later phases. Phase 2 is foundational.**
