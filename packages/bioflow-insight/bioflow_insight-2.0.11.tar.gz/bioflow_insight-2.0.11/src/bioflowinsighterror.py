#To handle the different type of errors; I'm gonna add numbers to the errors 
#Pair numbers if it's the users fault
#Odd if it's the bioflow-insight's fault
#This is really just to be able to do stats

#In the case something can disputed between the two, i categorise it in the users fault
#Since in futur updates i could handle when the tool makes a mistake, but i won't have
#to update the errors -> for example the numnber of parameters for a call
#In the current version, i can't handle implicit parameter (eg. multiple values in the channel)
#In any case, there is always a different way of writing it.

########################
#* [2] -> not the same number of parameters given for a process or a subworkflow
#* [4] -> a channel is trying to be created with a name already given to something else  
#* [6] -> multiple channels were given by an emit eventhough only expecting one
#* [8] -> tried to acces an emit even though the thing has not been called  
#* [10] -> tried to include a file which doesn't exist
#* [12] -> an include was present in a main or subworkflow
#* [14] -> in a pipe operator, the first thing called is unknown
#* [16] -> syntaxe error in the code
#* [18] -> something is expected to be defined in a file but is not 
#* [20] -> The sibworkflow either emits nothing or to many values for a use in an operation 
#* [22] -> a subworkflow or process defined was defined badly
#* [24] -> The user gives a relevant process which isn't in the workflow

#         ODD
########################
#* [1] -> presence of an import java or groovy (NOT USED RIGHT NOW)
