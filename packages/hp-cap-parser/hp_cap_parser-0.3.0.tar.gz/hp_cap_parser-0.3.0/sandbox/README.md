# Sandbox Directory

This directory is for testing and experimenting with the hp-cap-parser library.

## Setup

Install the package in editable mode (from the project root):

```bash
pip install -e .
```

With editable mode, any changes you make to the library code will be immediately available without reinstalling.

## Usage

Run test scripts:

```bash
python sandbox/test_parser.py
```

Add your own test files and sample XML data here for experimentation.
