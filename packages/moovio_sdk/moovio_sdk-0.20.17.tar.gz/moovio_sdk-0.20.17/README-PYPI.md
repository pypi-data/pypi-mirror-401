## Summary

Moov API: Moov is a platform that enables developers to integrate all aspects of money movement with ease and speed.
The Moov API makes it simple for platforms to send, receive, and store money. Our API is based upon REST
principles, returns JSON responses, and uses standard HTTP response codes. To learn more about how Moov
works at a high level, read our [concepts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/glossary/) guide.

For more information about the API: [Moov Guides and API Documentation](https://docs.moov.io/)

<!-- Start SDK Installation [installation] -->
## SDK Installation

> [!NOTE]
> **Python version upgrade policy**
>
> Once a Python version reaches its [official end of life date](https://devguide.python.org/versions/), a 3-month grace period is provided for users to upgrade. Following this grace period, the minimum python version supported in the SDK will be updated.

The SDK can be installed with *uv*, *pip*, or *poetry* package managers.

### uv

*uv* is a fast Python package installer and resolver, designed as a drop-in replacement for pip and pip-tools. It's recommended for its speed and modern Python tooling capabilities.

```bash
uv add moovio_sdk
```

### PIP

*PIP* is the default package installer for Python, enabling easy installation and management of packages from PyPI via the command line.

```bash
pip install moovio_sdk
```

### Poetry

*Poetry* is a modern tool that simplifies dependency management and package publishing by using a single `pyproject.toml` file to handle project metadata and dependencies.

```bash
poetry add moovio_sdk
```

### Shell and script usage with `uv`

You can use this SDK in a Python shell with [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and the `uvx` command that comes with it like so:

```shell
uvx --from moovio_sdk python
```

It's also possible to write a standalone Python script without needing to set up a whole project like so:

```python
#!/usr/bin/env -S uv run --script
# /// script
# requires-python = ">=3.9"
# dependencies = [
#     "moovio_sdk",
# ]
# ///

from moovio_sdk import Moov

sdk = Moov(
  # SDK arguments
)

# Rest of script here...
```

Once that is saved to a file, you can run it with `uv run script.py` where
`script.py` can be replaced with the actual file name.
<!-- End SDK Installation [installation] -->

<!-- Start IDE Support [idesupport] -->
## IDE Support

### PyCharm

Generally, the SDK will work well with most IDEs out of the box. However, when using PyCharm, you can enjoy much better integration with Pydantic by installing an additional plugin.

The same SDK client can also be used to make asynchronous requests by importing asyncio.

```python
# Asynchronous Example
import asyncio
from moovio_sdk import Moov
from moovio_sdk.models import components
from moovio_sdk.utils import parse_datetime

async def main():

    async with Moov(
        x_moov_version="v2024.01.00",
        security=components.Security(
            username="",
            password="",
        ),
    ) as moov:

        res = await moov.accounts.create_async(account_type=components.CreateAccountType.BUSINESS, profile=components.CreateProfile(
            business=components.CreateBusinessProfile(
                legal_business_name="Whole Body Fitness LLC",
            ),
        ), metadata={

### Per-Client Security Schemes

This SDK supports the following security scheme globally:

| Name                      | Type | Scheme     | Environment Variable                |
| ------------------------- | ---- | ---------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `username`<br/>`password` | http | HTTP Basic | `MOOV_USERNAME`<br/>`MOOV_PASSWORD` |

You can set the security parameters through the `security` optional parameter when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:
```python
from moovio_sdk import Moov
from moovio_sdk.models import components
from moovio_sdk.utils import parse_datetime


with Moov(
    security=components.Security(
        username="",
        password="",
    ),
    x_moov_version="v2024.01.00",
) as moov:

    res = moov.accounts.create(account_type=components.CreateAccountType.BUSINESS, profile=components.CreateProfile(
        business=components.CreateBusinessProfile(
            legal_business_name="Whole Body Fitness LLC",
        ),
    ), metadata={
        "optional": "metadata",
    }, terms_of_service={
        "manual": {
            "accepted_date": parse_datetime("2026-07-27T08:57:17.388Z"),
            "accepted_ip": "172.217.2.46",

* [create](https://github.com/moovfinancial/moov-python/blob/master/docs/sdks/accounts/README.md#create) - You can create **business** or **individual** accounts for your users (i.e., customers, merchants) by passing the required
information to Moov. Requirements differ per account type and requested [capabilities](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/capabilities/requirements/).

If you're requesting the `wallet`, `send-funds`, `collect-funds`, or `card-issuing` capabilities, you'll need to:
  + Send Moov the user [platform terms of service agreement](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/requirements/platform-agreement/) acceptance.
    This can be done upon account creation, or by [patching](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/accounts/patch/) the account using the `termsOfService` field.
If you're creating a business account with the business type `llc`, `partnership`, or `privateCorporation`, you'll need to:
  + Provide [business representatives](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/representatives/) after creating the account.
  + [Patch](https://docs.moov.io/api/moov-accounts/accounts/patch/) the account to indicate that business representative ownership information is complete.

Visit our documentation to read more about [creating accounts](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/create-accounts/) and [verification requirements](https://docs.moov.io/guides/accounts/requirements/identity-verification/).
Note that the `mode` field (for production or sandbox) is only required when creating a _facilitator_ account. All non-facilitator account requests will ignore the mode field and be set to the calling facilitator's mode.

* [initiate_micro_deposits](https://github.com/moovfinancial/moov-python/blob/master/docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiate_micro_deposits) - Micro-deposits help confirm bank account ownership, helping reduce fraud and the risk of unauthorized activity. 
Use this method to initiate the micro-deposit verification, sending two small credit transfers to the bank account 
you want to confirm.

If you request micro-deposits before 4:15PM ET, they will appear that same day. If you request micro-deposits any 
time after 4:15PM ET, they will appear the next banking day. When the two credits are initiated, Moov simultaneously
initiates a debit to recoup the micro-deposits. 

Micro-deposits initiated for a `sandbox` bank account will always be `$0.00` / `$0.00` and instantly verifiable once initiated.

You can simulate micro-deposit verification in test mode. See our [test mode](https://docs.moov.io/guides/get-started/test-mode/#micro-deposits)
guide for more information.

- `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending to the payment network
- `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification
- `failed`: Verification failed, description provided, user needs to add a new bank account
- `expired`: Verification expired after 14 days, initiate another verification
- `max-attempts-exceeded`: Five incorrect code attempts exhausted, initiate another verification

* [initiate_verification](https://github.com/moovfinancial/moov-python/blob/master/docs/sdks/bankaccounts/README.md#initiate_verification) - Instant micro-deposit verification offers a quick and efficient way to verify bank account ownership. 

Send a $0.01 credit with a unique verification code via RTP, FedNow, or same-day ACH, depending on the receiving bank's capabilities. This
feature provides a faster alternative to traditional methods, allowing verification in a single session.

It is recommended to use the `X-Wait-For: rail-response` header to synchronously receive the outcome of the instant credit in the
  response payload.

Possible verification methods:
  - `instant`: Real-time verification credit sent via RTP or FedNow
  - `ach`: Verification credit sent via same-day ACH

Possible statuses:
  - `new`: Verification initiated, credit pending
  - `sent-credit`: Credit sent, available for verification in the external bank account
  - `failed`: Verification failed due to credit rejection/return, details in `exceptionDetails`

When you run this request, you retrieve 200 transfers at a time. You can advance past a results set of 200 transfers by using the `skip` parameter (for example, 
if you set `skip`= 10, you will see a results set of 200 transfers after the first 10). If you are searching a high volume of transfers, the request will likely 
process very slowly. To achieve faster performance, restrict the data as much as you can by using the `StartDateTime` and `EndDateTime` parameters for a limited 
period of time. You can run multiple requests in smaller time window increments until you've retrieved all the transfers you need.

<!-- End Available Resources and Operations [operations] -->

<!-- Start File uploads [file-upload] -->
## File uploads

Certain SDK methods accept file objects as part of a request body or multi-part request. It is possible and typically recommended to upload files as a stream rather than reading the entire contents into memory. This avoids excessive memory consumption and potentially crashing with out-of-memory errors when working with very large files. The following example demonstrates how to attach a file stream to a request.

> [!TIP]
>
> For endpoints that handle file uploads bytes arrays can also be used. However, using streams is recommended for large files.
>

```python
from moovio_sdk import Moov
from moovio_sdk.models import components


with Moov(
    x_moov_version="v2024.01.00",
    security=components.Security(
        username="",
        password="",
    ),
) as moov:

    res = moov.disputes.upload_evidence_file(account_id="c09fd2f8-75fb-4ed9-be03-f8565d3ddc67", dispute_id="ad27f84d-00b1-4db0-8cf5-be001d71251d", file={
        "file_name": "example.file",
        "content": open("example.file", "rb"),
    }, evidence_type=components.EvidenceType.CANCELATION_POLICY)

    # Handle response
    print(res)

```
<!-- End File uploads [file-upload] -->

<!-- Start Retries [retries] -->
## Retries

Some of the endpoints in this SDK support retries. If you use the SDK without any configuration, it will fall back to the default retry strategy provided by the API. However, the default retry strategy can be overridden on a per-operation basis, or across the entire SDK.

To change the default retry strategy for a single API call, simply provide a `RetryConfig` object to the call:
```python
from moovio_sdk import Moov
from moovio_sdk.models import components
from moovio_sdk.utils import BackoffStrategy, RetryConfig, parse_datetime


with Moov(
    x_moov_version="v2024.01.00",
    security=components.Security(
        username="",
        password="",
    ),
) as moov:

    res = moov.accounts.create(account_type=components.CreateAccountType.BUSINESS, profile=components.CreateProfile(
        business=components.CreateBusinessProfile(
            legal_business_name="Whole Body Fitness LLC",
        ),
    ), metadata={
        "optional": "metadata",
    }, terms_of_service={
        "manual": {
            "accepted_date": parse_datetime("2026-07-27T08:57:17.388Z"),
            "accepted_ip": "172.217.2.46",
            "accepted_user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/94.0.4606.71 Safari/537.36",
            "accepted_domain": "https://rundown-depot.org/",
        },
    }, customer_support={
        "phone": {
            "number": "8185551212",
            "country_code": "1",
        },
        "email": "jordan.lee@classbooker.dev",
        "address": {
            "address_line1": "123 Main Street",
            "address_line2": "Apt 302",
            "city": "Boulder",
            "state_or_province": "CO",
            "postal_code": "80301",
            "country": "US",
        },
    }, settings={
        "card_payment": {
            "statement_descriptor": "Whole Body Fitness",
        },
        "ach_payment": {
            "company_name": "WholeBodyFitness",
        },
    }, mode=components.Mode.PRODUCTION,
        RetryConfig("backoff", BackoffStrategy(1, 50, 1.1, 100), False))

    # Handle response
    print(res)

```

If you'd like to override the default retry strategy for all operations that support retries, you can use the `retry_config` optional parameter when initializing the SDK:
```python
from moovio_sdk import Moov
from moovio_sdk.models import components
from moovio_sdk.utils import BackoffStrategy, RetryConfig, parse_datetime


with Moov(
    retry_config=RetryConfig("backoff", BackoffStrategy(1, 50, 1.1, 100), False),
    x_moov_version="v2024.01.00",
    security=components.Security(
        username="",
        password="",
    ),
) as moov:

    res = moov.accounts.create(account_type=components.CreateAccountType.BUSINESS, profile=components.CreateProfile(
        business=components.CreateBusinessProfile(
            legal_business_name="Whole Body Fitness LLC",
        ),
    ), metadata={
        "optional": "metadata",
    }, terms_of_service={
        "manual": {
            "accepted_date": parse_datetime("2026-07-27T08:57:17.388Z"),
            "accepted_ip": "172.217.2.46",
            "accepted_user_agent": "Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/94.0.4606.71 Safari/537.36",
            "accepted_domain": "https://rundown-depot.org/",
        },
    }, customer_support={
        "phone": {
            "number": "8185551212",

| ------------------ | ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `err.message`      | `str`            | Error message                                                                           |
| `err.status_code`  | `int`            | HTTP response status code eg `404`                                                      |
| `err.headers`      | `httpx.Headers`  | HTTP response headers                                                                   |
| `err.body`         | `str`            | HTTP body. Can be empty string if no body is returned.                                  |
| `err.raw_response` | `httpx.Response` | Raw HTTP response                                                                       |
| `err.data`         |                  | Optional. Some errors may contain structured data. [See Error Classes](https://github.com/moovfinancial/moov-python/blob/master/#error-classes). |

<!-- Start Custom HTTP Client [http-client] -->
## Custom HTTP Client

The Python SDK makes API calls using the [httpx](https://www.python-httpx.org/) HTTP library.  In order to provide a convenient way to configure timeouts, cookies, proxies, custom headers, and other low-level configuration, you can initialize the SDK client with your own HTTP client instance.
Depending on whether you are using the sync or async version of the SDK, you can pass an instance of `HttpClient` or `AsyncHttpClient` respectively, which are Protocol's ensuring that the client has the necessary methods to make API calls.
This allows you to wrap the client with your own custom logic, such as adding custom headers, logging, or error handling, or you can just pass an instance of `httpx.Client` or `httpx.AsyncClient` directly.

For example, you could specify a header for every request that this sdk makes as follows:
```python
from moovio_sdk import Moov
import httpx

http_client = httpx.Client(headers={"x-custom-header": "someValue"})
s = Moov(client=http_client)
```

or you could wrap the client with your own custom logic:
```python
from moovio_sdk import Moov
from moovio_sdk.httpclient import AsyncHttpClient
import httpx

class CustomClient(AsyncHttpClient):
    client: AsyncHttpClient

    def __init__(self, client: AsyncHttpClient):
        self.client = client

    async def send(
        self,
        request: httpx.Request,
        *,
        stream: bool = False,
        auth: Union[
            httpx._types.AuthTypes, httpx._client.UseClientDefault, None
        ] = httpx.USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT,
        follow_redirects: Union[
            bool, httpx._client.UseClientDefault
        ] = httpx.USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT,
    ) -> httpx.Response:
        request.headers["Client-Level-Header"] = "added by client"

        return await self.client.send(
            request, stream=stream, auth=auth, follow_redirects=follow_redirects
        )

    def build_request(
        self,
        method: str,
        url: httpx._types.URLTypes,
        *,
        content: Optional[httpx._types.RequestContent] = None,
        data: Optional[httpx._types.RequestData] = None,
        files: Optional[httpx._types.RequestFiles] = None,
        json: Optional[Any] = None,
        params: Optional[httpx._types.QueryParamTypes] = None,
        headers: Optional[httpx._types.HeaderTypes] = None,
        cookies: Optional[httpx._types.CookieTypes] = None,
        timeout: Union[
            httpx._types.TimeoutTypes, httpx._client.UseClientDefault
        ] = httpx.USE_CLIENT_DEFAULT,
        extensions: Optional[httpx._types.RequestExtensions] = None,
    ) -> httpx.Request:
        return self.client.build_request(
            method,
            url,
            content=content,
            data=data,
            files=files,
            json=json,
            params=params,

            cookies=cookies,
            timeout=timeout,
            extensions=extensions,
        )

s = Moov(async_client=CustomClient(httpx.AsyncClient()))
```
<!-- End Custom HTTP Client [http-client] -->

<!-- Start Resource Management [resource-management] -->
## Resource Management

The `Moov` class implements the context manager protocol and registers a finalizer function to close the underlying sync and async HTTPX clients it uses under the hood. This will close HTTP connections, release memory and free up other resources held by the SDK. In short-lived Python programs and notebooks that make a few SDK method calls, resource management may not be a concern. However, in longer-lived programs, it is beneficial to create a single SDK instance via a [context manager][context-manager] and reuse it across the application.

[context-manager]: https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#context-managers

```python
from moovio_sdk import Moov
from moovio_sdk.models import components
def main():

    with Moov(
        x_moov_version="v2024.01.00",
        security=components.Security(
            username="",
            password="",
        ),
    ) as moov:
        # Rest of application here...


# Or when using async:
async def amain():

    async with Moov(
        x_moov_version="v2024.01.00",
        security=components.Security(
            username="",
            password="",
        ),
    ) as moov:
        # Rest of application here...
```
<!-- End Resource Management [resource-management] -->

<!-- Start Debugging [debug] -->
## Debugging

You can setup your SDK to emit debug logs for SDK requests and responses.

You can pass your own logger class directly into your SDK.
```python
from moovio_sdk import Moov
import logging

logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
s = Moov(debug_logger=logging.getLogger("moovio_sdk"))
```

You can also enable a default debug logger by setting an environment variable `MOOV_DEBUG` to true.

# Development

## Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

## Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. Any manual changes added to internal files will be overwritten on the next generation. 
We look forward to hearing your feedback. Feel free to open a PR or an issue with a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release.
