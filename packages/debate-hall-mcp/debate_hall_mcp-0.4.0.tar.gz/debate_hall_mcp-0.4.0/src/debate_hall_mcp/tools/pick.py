"""debate_pick tool - Set next speaker in mediated mode (T6).

Immutables Compliance:
- I1 (COGNITIVE_STATE_ISOLATION): State managed exclusively in Hall server

TDD: Implements minimal functionality to pass tests.

Note: This tool is only valid for mediated mode debates.
In fixed mode, role sequence is automatic (Wind->Wall->Door).

Issue #37: Now persists expected_next_role for enforcement in debate_turn.
Issue #33: State directory configurable via DEBATE_HALL_STATE_DIR env var.
