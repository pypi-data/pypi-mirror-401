"""Debate engine logic for debate-hall-mcp.

This module implements:
- Turn sequence logic (fixed vs mediated modes)
- Resource limit enforcement (I3: Finite Dialectic Closure)
- Termination logic (synthesis, stalemate, exhaustion, force_close)
- Debate state transitions
- Synthesis validation (Issue #38: LOGOS semantics enforcement)

Immutables Compliance:
- I3 (FINITE_DIALECTIC_CLOSURE): Hard resource limits enforced
- I5 (SOVEREIGN_SAFETY_OVERRIDE): Force close capability
