## [0.1.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added

#### Core Features
- `init_debate` - Create debate rooms with configurable limits
- `add_turn` - Record Wind/Wall/Door turns with cognition validation
- `get_debate` - View state, transcript, and next speaker
- `close_debate` - Finalize with synthesis (JSON or OCTAVE format)
- `pick_next_speaker` - Mediated mode speaker selection
- `force_close_debate` - I5 safety kill switch
- `tombstone_turn` - I4-compliant turn redaction

#### GitHub Integration
- `github_sync_debate` - Sync debate turns to GitHub Discussions/Issues
- `ratify_rfc` - Generate ADR from synthesis and create PR
- `human_interject` - Inject human GitHub comments into debate

#### Architecture Immutables
- I1: Cognitive State Isolation - Server-side state management
- I3: Finite Dialectic Closure - Hard turn/round limits
- I4: Verifiable Event Ledger - SHA-256 hash chain
- I5: Sovereign Safety Override - Admin kill switch

#### Enforcement Hardening (PRs #42-#46)
- Role-cognition mapping (Wind/PATHOS, Wall/ETHOS, Door/LOGOS)
- Mediated mode expected speaker persistence
- Synthesis validation (LOGOS rules on close)
- Atomic file writes (tempfile + rename + fsync)
- Audit trail with tombstone context preservation

### Quality
- 262 tests (257 unit + 5 e2e)
- 91.44% test coverage
- mypy strict mode (0 errors)
- ruff + black (0 violations)

### Documentation
- Comprehensive README with tool reference
- Agent definitions (Wind, Wall, Door)
- Specialist agents (Ideator, Validator, Synthesizer)
- Wall Content Contract (OCTAVE semantic structure)
- Multi-model debate patterns guide

## Known Limitations

### Issue #73: Phase 2 GitHub Automation (Investigation)
Automated debate triggering via GitHub webhooks/actions is not yet implemented. The three core GitHub tools (`github_sync_debate`, `ratify_rfc`, `human_interject`) are fully functional for manual orchestration. See Issue #73 for investigation status.
