# debate-hall-mcp Environment Configuration
#
# Copy this file to .env in the same directory and customize as needed.
# The server automatically loads .env on startup - no need to put secrets
# in your MCP client configuration (e.g., ~/.claude.json).
#
# How to generate a GitHub token:
#   1. Go to GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens
#   2. Click "Tokens (classic)" → "Generate new token (classic)"
#   3. Name it (e.g., "debate-hall-mcp")
#   4. Select scopes: repo, write:discussion
#   5. Generate and copy the token (it won't be shown again!)
#
# Or use Fine-grained tokens (more secure):
#   1. GitHub → Settings → Developer settings → Fine-grained tokens
#   2. Select specific repositories
#   3. Grant: Issues (read/write), Discussions (read/write), Pull requests (read/write)

# GitHub Integration
# Required for github_sync_debate, ratify_rfc, and human_interject tools
# GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx

# Feature Toggle: GitHub Tools
# Set to 'false' to disable all GitHub integration tools
# Useful if you don't need GitHub features or want to avoid rate limit issues
# Default: true (enabled)
# GITHUB_TOOLS_ENABLED=true

# Rate Limiting Notes:
# - GitHub primary rate limit: 5000 requests/hour for authenticated users
# - GitHub secondary rate limit: ~80 content-creating requests/minute
# - The tools implement exponential backoff with retry on 429/403 responses
# - If you hit rate limits frequently, consider:
#   1. Reducing sync frequency
#   2. Using a GitHub App with higher limits
#   3. Temporarily disabling tools with GITHUB_TOOLS_ENABLED=false

# Debate Storage Location (Issue #33)
# Directory where debate state files (.json) are saved
#
# Resolution priority:
# 1. DEBATE_HALL_STATE_DIR env var (if set) - explicit override
# 2. Project root / "debates" (auto-detected via .git or pyproject.toml)
# 3. ./debates (fallback if no project markers found)
#
# The default behavior (priority 2) finds your project root and stores
# debates there, ensuring they live with the code they relate to.
#
# For global debate storage (e.g., cross-project debates), set explicitly:
# DEBATE_HALL_STATE_DIR=/Users/yourusername/debates
#
# Or use environment variable expansion (if supported):
# DEBATE_HALL_STATE_DIR=$HOME/debates
#
# Leave unset to use automatic project-relative detection (recommended).
