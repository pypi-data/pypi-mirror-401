# Publish to PyPI on GitHub Release
#
# This workflow publishes the package to PyPI when a GitHub release is created.
# It uses PyPI's trusted publisher feature (no API tokens needed).
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Configure trusted publisher on PyPI:
#    - Go to https://pypi.org/manage/project/yt-api-mcp/settings/publishing/
#    - Add GitHub as trusted publisher with:
#      - Owner: l4b4r4b4b4
#      - Repository: mcp-refcache (this is a monorepo, yt-mcp is in examples/)
#      - Workflow: publish.yml
#      - Environment: pypi (optional but recommended)
#
# Usage:
#   uvx yt-api-mcp stdio          # Local CLI mode
#   uvx yt-api-mcp sse            # SSE server mode
#   uvx yt-api-mcp streamable-http # Recommended for remote
