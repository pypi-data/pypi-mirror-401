  explanations_note: Explanations are for human review; only requirements.field_requirements
    are enforced.
  explanations_glossary:
    iqr: 'Interquartile Range (Q3 - Q1): a robust measure of spread, less sensitive
      to outliers.'
    q1: 25th percentile of the training values.
    q3: 75th percentile of the training values.
    coverage: Share of non-null training values that satisfy the rule.
    unique_count: Number of distinct non-null values observed in training.
    mad: 'Median Absolute Deviation: robust measure of variability around the median.'
    quantile: Statistical measure dividing data into equal-sized intervals.
    training_pass: Guarantee that generated rules pass on the training data used for
      generation.
    enum_strategy: Method used for allowed values inference (coverage or tolerant).
    margin_days: Buffer added to date ranges to allow for reasonable variations.
