# MarkDeck

A lightweight markdown presentation tool

---

## What is MarkDeck?

MarkDeck is a simple, fast, and beautiful way to create presentations using Markdown.

- Write slides in plain text
- No complex software needed
- Focus on content, not formatting

---

## Getting Started

Create a markdown file with slides separated by `---`:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>MarkDown</th>
    <th>Result</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td rowspan="2"><img src="./images/markdown.png" alt="markdown"></td>
    <td><img src="./images/slide1.png" alt="slide1"></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="./images/slide2.png" alt="slide2"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

---

## Key Features

- **Markdown-based**: Use familiar syntax
- **Fast**: Lightweight and responsive
- **Keyboard shortcuts**: Navigate with ease
- **Syntax highlighting**: Beautiful code blocks
- **Speaker notes**: Hidden notes for presenters

---

## Keyboard Navigation

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| → / Space | Next slide |
| ← | Previous slide |
| Home | First slide |
| End | Last slide |
| F | Fullscreen |
| ? | Help |

---

## Speaker Notes

This slide demonstrates speaker notes functionality.

Speaker notes appear in the terminal where you run markdeck.

<!--NOTES:
These are speaker notes. They appear in the terminal where you run markdeck, not in the browser.

Use speaker notes to:
- Remember key points
- Add talking points
- Keep timing notes
- Store additional context
-->

## Images and Links

You can include images:

And links: [Visit MarkDeck on GitHub](https://github.com)

---

## Advanced Code Highlighting

Python with type hints:

```python
from typing import List, Optional

def process_data(items: List[str], limit: Optional[int] = None) -> dict:
    """Process a list of items and return statistics."""
    result = {
        'count': len(items),
        'items': items[:limit] if limit else items
    }
    return result
```

---

## More Language Support

Rust:

```rust
fn main() {
    let numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    let sum: i32 = numbers.iter().sum();
    println!("Sum: {}", sum);
}
```

SQL:

```sql
SELECT users.name, COUNT(orders.id) as order_count
FROM users
LEFT JOIN orders ON users.id = orders.user_id
GROUP BY users.id
HAVING order_count > 5;
```

## Complex Tables

| Feature | MarkDeck | PowerPoint | Google Slides |
|---------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Markdown | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Version Control | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Lightweight | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |
| Syntax Highlighting | ✓ | Limited | Limited |
| Free | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ |
| Open Source | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ |

---

## Wide Slide Mode

For slides with wide tables or content, use the `<!--SLIDE:wide-->` directive:

```markdown
<!--SLIDE:wide-->
```

This expands the slide to use 90% of the viewport width.

---

<!--SLIDE:wide-->

## Wide Table Example

This slide demonstrates the wide mode - the directive `<!--SLIDE:wide-->` was placed at the top of this slide:

| Feature | Free Tier | Basic | Pro | Enterprise | API Access | Custom | Notes |
|---------|-----------|-------|-----|------------|------------|--------|-------|
| Users | 5 | 25 | 100 | Unlimited | ✓ | ✓ | Contact sales for enterprise pricing and volume discounts |
| Storage | 1GB | 10GB | 100GB | 1TB | 10TB | Custom | Expandable storage with automatic scaling and backup options |
| Support | Community | Email | Priority | 24/7 | 24/7 | Dedicated | SLA included with guaranteed response times and escalation |
| Features | Basic | Standard | Advanced | All | All + API | Custom | Integrations available with major platforms and custom webhooks |

**Available modes**: `wide` (90% viewport), `full` (95%), `ultra-wide` (98%)

---

## Text Formatting

You can use **bold**, *italic*, ***bold italic***, ~~strikethrough~~, and `inline code`.

You can also combine them: **bold with `code`** and *italic with `code`*.

---

## Block Quotes

> "Simplicity is the ultimate sophistication."
>
> — Leonardo da Vinci

> Multi-paragraph quotes work too.
>
> Just add a blank `>` line between paragraphs within the quote block.
>
> This is the third paragraph of this blockquote.

---

## Slide Delimiters

In MarkDeck, `---` is used to separate slides.

**Note**: The slide delimiter `---` must be on its own line with blank lines before and after.

Because of this, you cannot use `---` as a horizontal rule within a slide — it will always create a new slide instead.

---

## Lists with Nesting

Complex nested structure:

1. First level
   - Nested bullet
   - Another bullet
     - Even deeper
     - More depth
2. Back to first level
   1. Nested number
   2. Another number
3. Final item

---

## Math Equations

MarkDeck supports math equations using KaTeX:

**Inline math**: The famous equation $E = mc^2$ changed physics forever.

**Display math** (centered on its own line):

$$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-x^2} dx = \sqrt{\pi}$$

**More examples**: $\sum_{i=1}^{n} i = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}$ and $\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$

    D --> B
    C --> E[End]
```

        +currentSlideIndex
        +init()
        +showSlide()
        +nextSlide()
    }
    class Slide {

    commit
    commit
    branch develop
    checkout develop
    commit
    commit
    checkout main
    merge develop
    commit
```

## Mermaid Pie Chart

```mermaid
pie title Language Distribution
    "JavaScript" : 45
    "Python" : 30
    "HTML/CSS" : 15
    "Other" : 10
```

## Two-Column Layouts

MarkDeck now supports two-column layouts!

Use the `:::columns` syntax with `|||` as a separator:

```markdown
:::columns
Left content
|||
Right content
:::
```

---

## Two-Column Example: Comparison

:::columns
### Pros

- Easy to use
- Fast development
- Markdown-based
- Version control friendly

|||

### Cons

- Limited styling
- No animations
- Requires technical setup
- Text-focused
:::

---

## Two-Column Example: Code & Explanation

:::columns
### The Code

```python
def factorial(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 1
    return n * factorial(n - 1)
```

|||

### How It Works

This is a **recursive function** that calculates the factorial of a number.

**Base case**: When n ≤ 1, return 1

**Recursive case**: Multiply n by the factorial of (n-1)

**Example**: `factorial(5)` returns 120
:::

---

## Two-Column Example: Features & Benefits

:::columns
### Features

- Markdown support
- Syntax highlighting
- Hot reload
- Speaker notes
- Grid view
- Math equations
- Mermaid diagrams

|||

### Benefits

Perfect for technical presentations where you need to show code alongside explanations.

The columns automatically stack on mobile devices for better readability.

You can use **any markdown** in columns: lists, code, images, links, etc.
:::

## Two-Column Example: Image & Description

:::columns
### Architecture

Modern web applications typically follow a three-tier architecture:

1. **Presentation Layer**: User interface
2. **Business Logic**: Application logic
3. **Data Layer**: Database and storage

This separation of concerns makes applications more maintainable and scalable.

|||

### Diagram

```mermaid
graph TB
    UI[User Interface]
    BL[Business Logic]
    DB[(Database)]

    UI --> BL
    BL --> DB
    DB --> BL
    BL --> UI
```
:::

---

## Two-Column with Custom Width

You can now specify a percentage width for the first column using `:::columns[width]`:

```markdown
:::columns[70]
This column gets 70% of the width
|||
This column gets the remaining 30%
:::
```

The width must be between 1 and 99.

---

## Custom Width Example: 70/30 Split

:::columns[70]
### Main Content (70%)

This is the primary content area with more space:

- Perfect for detailed explanations
- Code examples that need more width
- Main narrative or story
- Primary visual elements

The wider column draws more attention and is ideal for the most important content on your slide.

|||

### Sidebar (30%)

**Notes**:

- Key points
- Quick refs
- Links
- Tips

Short, concise supporting information.
:::

---

## Custom Width Example: 60/40 Code Review

:::columns[60]
### Implementation

```python
class DataProcessor:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.results = []

    def process(self):
        for item in self.data:
            result = self.transform(item)
            self.results.append(result)
        return self.results

    def transform(self, item):
        return item.upper()
```

|||

### Review Notes

**Strengths**:
- Clear structure
- Good naming
- Simple logic

**Suggestions**:
- Add type hints
- Handle errors
- Add docstrings
- Use list comprehension

**Performance**: O(n) time complexity
