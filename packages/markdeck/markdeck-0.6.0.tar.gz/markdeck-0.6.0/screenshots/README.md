# MarkDeck Screenshots

This directory contains automatically generated screenshots of MarkDeck features.

## Grid View Screenshots

Captured by `capture_screenshots.py`:

- **01_normal_view.png** - Standard presentation view showing a single slide
- **02_grid_overview.png** - Grid overview mode showing all slides in a grid layout
- **03_grid_scrolled.png** - Grid overview scrolled to show more slides
- **04_after_navigation.png** - Presentation view after clicking on a slide in grid mode
- **05_grid_current_highlight.png** - Grid overview with current slide highlighted

## Theme Screenshots

Captured by `capture_theme_screenshots.py`:

- **theme_dark.png** - Presentation in dark theme (default)
- **theme_light.png** - Presentation in light theme
- **theme_dark_grid.png** - Grid overview in dark theme
- **theme_light_grid.png** - Grid overview in light theme

## Generation

Screenshots are automatically generated by GitHub Actions when:
- Pull requests modify files in `markdeck/static/` or `examples/`
- Changes are pushed to these paths
- Manually triggered via the "Generate Screenshots" workflow

To manually generate screenshots locally (requires Playwright browsers):

```bash
# Start MarkDeck server
.venv/bin/markdeck present examples/features.md --port 8888 --no-browser &

# Generate grid view screenshots
python capture_screenshots.py

# Generate theme screenshots
python capture_theme_screenshots.py
```

**Note:** Local screenshot generation requires Playwright browsers to be installed, which may not work in environments with network restrictions. Use GitHub Actions for reliable screenshot generation.

## Cross-Platform Rendering Differences

Screenshots rendered on different platforms (e.g., macOS vs Linux on GitHub Actions) may produce slightly different pixel output due to:

- **Font rendering** - different font smoothing and anti-aliasing algorithms
- **Subpixel rendering** - macOS and Linux handle this differently
- **Browser engine variations** - even the same Chromium version can render slightly differently across platforms

This means comparing screenshots captured locally (macOS) with those from GitHub Actions (Linux) may show 2-4% pixel differences even when the content is identical.

For reliable visual diff comparisons, always capture screenshots in the same environment. The GitHub Actions workflow ensures consistent Linux-based rendering for all committed screenshots.

The `--threshold` option (default: 0.1%) filters out minor rendering noise while still catching real content changes.
