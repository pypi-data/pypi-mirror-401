                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

# Amas-FF14-Combat-Sim_source
Open source code for Ama's FF14 Combat Sim.

# Quick start
If you would like to run the sim but do not want to install it, go to the [Python Notebook Github](https://github.com/Amarantine-xiv/Amas-FF14-Combat-Sim) and follow the instruction to open and use *CoreSimulator.ipynb*.

If you would like to install the sim to run locally, run ```pip install ama-xiv-combat-sim``` on your machine to install the core packages. You may want to refer to some of the code in the [Python Notebook](https://github.com/Amarantine-xiv/Amas-FF14-Combat-Sim/blob/main/CoreSimulator.ipynb) to grab some visualization/plotting code that visualizes the sim's output.

# About
This open-source package simulates the damage of given gearsets and rotations, producing the full distributions over damage values and various statistics, like the expected max damage over N runs (useful for parsers). Currently, all lvl 100 standard combat classes are supported. For issues/feature requests and news, join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/CV6sHj8h9D) server.

Unlike other simulators/spreadsheets, this gives more than just expected damage with an approximation of damage variance- this is an accurate [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) simulation that gives the full range and distribution over all possible damage values. This tool is an installable pip package, and is also in a standalone [Python Notebook](https://github.com/Amarantine-xiv/Amas-FF14-Combat-Sim/blob/main/CoreSimulator.ipynb) that can be run on Google's Colab in 2 mouse clicks.

The sim's main computation engine is written in Numpy, relying on parallelized matrix-based computations for the heavy lifting. It runs fairly fast (a typical ~30s opener with 1M samples takes about 1-2 seconds on a single CPU).

The tool has four advantages over existing simulators/spreadsheets:

1) handles the simulation of all FF14 job classes in a single place- no need to maintain multiple spreadsheets, etc.,

2) incorporates all damage rolls and crit/dh procs on a per-damage-instance basis, and rolls them every time the sim is run,

3) enables the building of several useful community tools that either don't exist, or can be streamlined, using this sim as a backend, and

4) allows for the incorporation of procs in the simulation process itself.

Some examples of useful tools is a *kill time estimator*, that takes a 1) full 8-player rotation including LB usage, and 2) a target boss HP values, and outputs a distribution over expected kill times. To see a demonstration of this and other capabilities built on top of the sim, please refer to the [Python Notebook Github](https://github.com/Amarantine-xiv/Amas-FF14-Combat-Sim).

# Usage

## Imports
After installation, make sure to *import ama-xiv-combat-sim* so that paths, etc. are set up. After this, you can import sub-packages/functions/files as you wish, and use them. Rotations can be specified both in code in the sim itself, and by passing in CSV files.

## Example Single Target, Single Player rotation, typed directly into the sim.
