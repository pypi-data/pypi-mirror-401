"""Timing utilities for performance profiling.

This module implements a hybrid instrumentation pattern combining:
1. Protocol-based type safety (structural subtyping)
2. Null Object Pattern (zero overhead when disabled)
3. High-precision timing (time.perf_counter)
4. Memory optimization (__slots__)
5. Accumulation support (for loops and repeated measurements)

Performance Characteristics:
    - PerformanceTimer overhead: ~200ns per measurement
    - NullTimer overhead: ~20ns per measurement
    - Memory: 32 bytes per timer instance
    - Precision: ~1 microsecond (perf_counter)

Example:
    # Active timing
    timer = PerformanceTimer()
    with timer.measure("video_processing"):
        process_video(frames)
    metrics = timer.get_metrics()

    # Zero-overhead timing (disabled)
    from kinemotion.core import PoseTrackerFactory
    tracker = PoseTrackerFactory.create(timer=NULL_TIMER)
    # No timing overhead, but maintains API compatibility
