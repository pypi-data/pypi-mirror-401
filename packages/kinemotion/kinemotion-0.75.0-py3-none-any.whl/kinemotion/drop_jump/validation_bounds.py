"""Drop jump metrics physiological bounds for validation testing.

This module defines realistic physiological bounds for Drop Jump metrics
based on biomechanical literature and real-world athlete performance.

Drop jump metrics differ from CMJ:
- Contact time (ground interaction during landing)
- Flight time (time in air after landing)
- RSI (Reactive Strength Index) = flight_time / contact_time
- Jump height (calculated from flight time)
