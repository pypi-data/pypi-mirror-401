    """Edits an existing artifact's manifest.

    Parameters
    ----------
    self: AsyncHyphaArtifact
        The HyphaArtifact instance to use.

    artifact_id: The id of the artifact to edit. It can be an uuid generated by
        create or edit function, or it can be an alias of the artifact under the
        current workspace. If you want to refer to an artifact in another
        workspace, you should use the full alias in the format of
        "workspace_id/alias".

    manifest: The updated manifest. Ensure the manifest follows the required schema
        if applicable (e.g., for collections).

    type: Optional. The type of the artifact. Supported values are collection,
        generic and any other custom type. By default, it's set to generic which
        contains fields tailored for displaying the artifact as cards on a webpage.

    permissions: Optional.
        A dictionary containing user permissions.
        For example {"*": "r+"} gives read and create access to everyone,
        {"@": "rw+"} allows all authenticated users to read/write/create,
        {"user_id_1": "r+"} grants read and create permissions to a specific user.
        You can also set permissions for specific operations,
        such as {"user_id_1": ["read", "create"]}. See detailed explanation about
        permissions below.

    secrets: Optional. A dictionary containing secrets to be stored with the
        artifact.
        Secrets are encrypted and can only be accessed by the artifact owner
        or users with appropriate permissions. See the create function for a
        list of supported secrets.

    config: Optional. A dictionary containing additional configuration options for
        the artifact.

    version: Optional. Strict Validation Applied: Must be None, "new", or an
        existing version name from the artifact's versions array. Custom version
        names are NOT allowed during edit - they can only be specified during
        commit().

        None (default): Updates the latest existing version
        "new": Creates a new version immediately (unless stage=True)
        "stage": Enters staging mode (equivalent to stage=True)
        "existing_version_name": Updates the specified existing version
            (must already exist in the versions array)

    Special Staging Behavior: When stage=True and version="new" are used together,
        it stores an intent marker for creating a new version during commit,
        and allows custom version names to be specified later during the commit()
        operation.

    stage: Optional. If True, the artifact will be edited in staging mode regardless
        of the version parameter. Default is False. When in staging mode, the
        artifact must be committed to finalize changes.

    comment: Optional.
        A comment to describe the changes made to the artifact.

    Important Notes:

        Version Validation: The system now strictly validates the version parameter.
            You cannot specify arbitrary custom version names during edit.
        Staging Intent System: When you use version="new" with stage=True,
            the system stores an "intent" to create a new version, which allows you
            to specify a custom version name later during commit().
        Historical Version Editing: You can edit specific existing versions by providing
            their exact version name (e.g., version="v1"), but the version must already
            exist.

    be an empty list.

    Parameters
    ----------
    self: AsyncHyphaArtifact
        The HyphaArtifact instance to use.

    workspace: Optional. The workspace id where the artifact will be created.
        If not set, it will be created in the default workspace. If specified,
        it should match the workspace in the artifact_id and also the parent_id.

    parent_id: The id of the parent collection where the artifact will be created.
        If the artifact is a top-level collection,
        leave this field empty or set to None.

    type: The type of the artifact. Supported values are collection,
        vector-collection, generic and any other custom type. By default, it's set to
    generic which contains fields tailored for displaying the artifact as cards
    on a webpage.

    manifest: The manifest of the new artifact. Ensure the manifest follows the
        required schema if applicable (e.g., for collections).

    config: Optional. A dictionary containing additional configuration options for
        the artifact (shared for both staged and committed). For collections,
        the config can contain the following special fields:

        collection_schema: Optional. A JSON schema that defines the structure of
            child artifacts in the collection. This schema is used to validate
            child artifacts when they are created or edited. If a child artifact
            does not conform to the schema, the creation or edit operation will fail
        id_parts: Optional. A dictionary of id name parts to be used in generating
            the id for child artifacts. For example:
            {"animals": ["dog", "cat", ...], "colors": ["red", "blue", ...]}.
            This can be used for creating child artifacts with auto-generated ids
            based on the id parts. For example, when calling create, you can specify
            the alias as my-pet-{colors}-{animals}, and the id will be generated
            based on the id parts, e.g., my-pet-red-dog.
        permissions: Optional. A dictionary containing user permissions. For example
            {"*": "r+"} gives read and create access to everyone, {"@": "rw+"}
            allows all authenticated users to read/write/create, and {"user_id_1": "r+"}
            grants read and create permissions to a specific user. You can also set
            permissions for specific operations, such as
            {"user_id_1": ["read", "create"]}. See detailed explanation about
            permissions below.
    list_fields: Optional. A list of fields to be collected when calling list
        function. By default, it collects all fields in the artifacts. If you want
        to collect only specific fields, you can set this field to a list of field
        names, e.g. ["manifest", "download_count"].
        publish_to: Optional. A string specifying the target platform to publish the
        artifact. Supported values are zenodo and sandbox_zenodo. If set, the artifact
        will be published to the specified platform. The artifact must have a valid
        Zenodo metadata schema to be published.

    version: Optional. Version Creation Behavior: Controls initial version creation
        for the artifact.

        None or "new" (default): Creates version "v0" immediately (unless stage=True)
        "stage": Creates the artifact in staging mode (equivalent to stage=True)

    Important: If stage=True is specified, any version parameter is ignored and
        the artifact starts in staging mode. When a staged artifact is committed,
        it will create version "v0" by default.

    stage: Optional. If True, the artifact will be created in staging mode regardless
        of the version parameter. Default is False. When in staging mode,
        you must call commit() to finalize the artifact with its first version.

    comment: Optional.
        A comment to describe the changes made to the artifact.

    secrets: Optional.
        A dictionary containing secrets to be stored with the artifact.
        Secrets are encrypted and can only be accessed by the artifact owner or users
        with appropriate permissions. The following keys can be used:

        ZENODO_ACCESS_TOKEN: The Zenodo access token to publish the artifact to Zenodo.
        SANDBOX_ZENODO_ACCESS_TOKEN: The Zenodo access token to publish the artifact to
            the Zenodo sandbox.
        S3_ENDPOINT_URL: The endpoint URL of the S3 storage for the artifact.
        S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID: The access key ID for the S3 storage for the artifact.
        S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: The secret access key for the S3 storage for the artifact.
        S3_REGION_NAME: The region name of the S3 storage for the artifact.
        S3_BUCKET: The bucket name of the S3 storage for the artifact. Default to the
            hypha workspaces bucket.
        S3_PREFIX: The prefix of the S3 storage for the artifact. Default: "".
    S3_PUBLIC_ENDPOINT_URL: The public endpoint URL of the S3 storage for the
    artifact. If the S3 server is not public, you can set this to the public
    endpoint URL. Default: None.

    overwrite: Optional.
        A boolean flag to overwrite the existing artifact with the
        same alias. Default is False.

    Note 1: If you set stage=True, you must call commit() to finalize the artifact.

    Parameters
    ----------
    self: AsyncHyphaArtifact
        The instance of the AsyncHyphaArtifact class.

    parent_id: str
        The id of the parent artifact or collection to list children
        from. It can be an uuid generated by create or edit function, or it can be
        an alias of the artifact under the current workspace. If you want to refer
        to an artifact in another workspace, you should use the full alias in the
        format of "workspace_id/alias". If not specified, the function lists all
        top-level artifacts in the current workspace.

    keywords: List[str], optional
        A list of search terms used for fuzzy searching
        across all manifest fields. Each term is searched independently, and
        results matching any term will be included. For example,
        ["sample", "dataset"] returns artifacts containing either
        "sample" or "dataset" in any field of the manifest.

    filters: dict, optional
        A dictionary where each key is a manifest field name
        and each value specifies the match for that field. Filters support both
        exact and range-based matching, depending on the field. You can filter
        based on the keys inside the manifest, as well as internal fields like
        permissions and view/download statistics. Supported internal
        fields include:

        type: Matches the artifact type exactly, e.g., {"type": "application"}.
        created_by: Matches the exact creator ID, e.g., {"created_by": "user123"}.
        created_at and last_modified: Accept a single timestamp (lower bound) or
            a range for filtering. For example,
            {"created_at": [1620000000, 1630000000]} filters artifacts created
            between the two timestamps.
        view_count and download_count: Accept a single value or a range for
            filtering, as with date fields. For example, {"view_count": [10, 100]}
            filters artifacts viewed between 10 and 100 times.
        permissions/<user_id>: Searches for artifacts with specific permissions
            assigned to the given user_id.
        version: Matches the exact version of the artifact, it only support
            "stage", "committed" or "*" (both staged or committed). If stage is
            specified, this filter should align with the stage parameter.
        manifest: Matches the exact value of the field, e.g.,
            "manifest": {"name": "example-dataset"}. These filters also support
            fuzzy matching if a value contains a wildcard (*),
            e.g., "manifest": {"name": "dataset*"}, depending on the SQL backend.
        config: Matches the exact value of the field in the config, e.g.,
            "config": {"collection_schema": {"type": "object"}}.

    mode: str, optional
        Defines how multiple conditions (from keywords and filters) are combined.
        Use "AND" to ensure all conditions must match, or "OR" to includ
        artifacts meeting any condition.
        Default is "AND".

    offset: int, optional
        The number of artifacts to skip before listing results.
        Default is 0.

    limit: int, optional
        The maximum number of artifacts to return.
        Default is 100.

    order_by: str, optional
        The field used to order results. Options include:
        Built-in fields: view_count, download_count, last_modified, created_at, and id.
        Custom JSON fields: manifest.<field_name> or config.<field_name>
            (e.g., manifest.likes, config.priority).
        Use a suffix < or > to specify ascending or descending order, respectively
            (e.g., view_count< for ascending, manifest.likes> for descending).
        Default ordering is ascending by id if not specified.

    silent: bool, optional
        If True, prevents incrementing the view count for the parent artifact when
        listing children. Default is False.

    stage: bool, optional
        Controls which artifacts to return based on their staging status:
        True: Return only staged artifacts
        False: Return only committed artifacts (default)
        'all': Return both staged and committed artifacts
