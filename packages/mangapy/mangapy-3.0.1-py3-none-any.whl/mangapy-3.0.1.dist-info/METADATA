## Installation

```

```

## Usage

### Terminal

Mangapy let you download manga chapters as images (default) or pdfs.
Use 'mangapy -h' to get a list of all the availabe options.

Downloads all Bleach chatpers as images inside the *Downloads* folder (from Fanfox source).  

```
mangapy title bleach -a -o ~/Downloads
```

Downloads all Bleach chatpers as a single **.pdf** file inside the *Downloads* folder (from Fanfox source).  

```
mangapy title bleach -a -o ~/Downloads --pdf
```

Downloads Bleach chatper 1 as images inside the *Downloads* folder (from Fanfox source).  

```
mangapy title bleach -c 1 -o ~/Downloads
```

Downloads Bleach chatpers from 0 to 10 (included) as images inside the *Downloads* folder using Fanfox as source.  

```
mangapy title bleach -c 0-10 -o ~/Downloads -s fanfox
```

Disable network retries (useful for benchmarking).

```
mangapy title bleach -c 1 -o ~/Downloads --no-retry
```

```
mangapy title bleach -c 1 -o ~/Downloads --no-progress
```

You may need a proxy to download certain manga, to do so use the option *-p or --proxy*:

```
mangapy title "one piece" -o ~/Downloads -p '{"http": "194.226.34.132:8888", "https": "194.226.34.132:8888"}'
```

### YAML

Mangapy let you download multiple manga chapters as images (default) or pdfs from a *.yaml* file.
For every manga you can choose:
- source (*fanfox*, *mangadex*)
- whether or not save the manga as a single pdf
- which chapter to download (single, range, all, last)
- MangaDex-only options: `translated_language`, `content_rating`, `data_saver`

```
mangapy yaml PATH_TO_YOUR_YAML_FILE
```

Samples for YAML mode live in `samples/`. For local testing from source, run:

```
uv run python3 scripts/dev_run.py <sample-filename.yaml>
```

```yaml
