# Full Configuration Example
#
# This example shows ALL available configuration options with their default values.
# Use this as a reference when customizing your setup.
#
# You don't need to specify every option - only include the ones you want to change
# from their defaults. The configuration system uses deep merging, so any missing
# values will automatically use the defaults shown here.

[tool.structure-lint]
# Master switch to enable/disable entire linter
enabled = true

# Directories to search for Python files (relative to project root)
# This applies to ALL validators (line_limits, one_per_file, structure)
# The tool automatically excludes: .venv/, __pycache__/, .git/, node_modules/
search_paths = ["src"]

[tool.structure-lint.validators]
# Control which validators are enabled
structure = false      # Opt-in (default: disabled) - enforces folder structure
line_limits = true     # Default: enabled - enforces max lines per file
one_per_file = true    # Default: enabled - enforces single definition per file

[tool.structure-lint.line_limits]
# Maximum number of lines allowed per Python file
max_lines = 150

[tool.structure-lint.structure]

# Maximum depth of feature folder nesting
# Depth counts from base folder children (depth 0) downward
# Example: src/features/auth/auth_login/ = depth 1
folder_depth = 2

# Standard folders that can appear inside feature/module directories
# These represent common code organization patterns and cannot have subdirectories
standard_folders = ["types", "utils", "constants", "tests"]

# Separator used for feature folder prefix naming
# Feature folders must be named: parent_name + separator + folder_name
# Example with "_": auth folder contains auth_login, auth_logout
# Set to "" for no separator (direct concatenation)
prefix_separator = "_"

# Python files allowed in any directory, even those that normally shouldn't contain files
# Note: Non-.py files (like README.md, .gitkeep) are automatically ignored and don't need listing
files_allowed_anywhere = ["__init__.py"]

# Folder name patterns to ignore during structure validation
# Supports wildcards (e.g., *.egg-info matches my_package.egg-info)
# These are typically cache, build, or tool-generated directories
ignored_folders = [
    "__pycache__",
    ".mypy_cache",
    ".pytest_cache",
    ".ruff_cache",
    ".hypothesis",
    ".tox",
    ".coverage",
    "*.egg-info"
]

# ============================================================================
# Usage Examples:
# ============================================================================
#
# With this full default configuration, your project structure should look like:
#
# project/
# ├── pyproject.toml          (contains this configuration)
# ├── src/
# │   └── features/           (base folder)
# │       ├── authentication/ (feature directory at depth 0)
# │       │   ├── types/      (standard folder - files allowed here)
# │       │   ├── utils/      (standard folder)
# │       │   ├── constants/  (standard folder)
# │       │   ├── tests/      (standard folder)
# │       │   └── authentication_oauth/   (feature folder at depth 1, prefixed)
# │       │       ├── types/
# │       │       └── authentication_oauth_google/  (depth 2, fully prefixed)
# │       │           └── types/
# │       └── reporting/      (another feature at depth 0)
# │           └── ...
#
# ============================================================================
# Customization Tips:
# ============================================================================
#
# 1. Start minimal - only specify what you want to change from defaults
# 2. Use comments to document why you chose specific values
# 3. Adjust line_limits.max_lines based on your team's preferences
# 4. Customize standard_folders to match your architecture (e.g., MVC)
# 5. Only include directories you want validated in search_paths
# 6. Adjust folder_depth for deeper or shallower nesting limits
# 7. Disable validators you don't want with false
# 8. Change prefix_separator to match your naming conventions
