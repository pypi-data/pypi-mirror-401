Reticulum-Telemetry-Hub (RTH) is an independent component within the [Reticulum](https://reticulum.network/) / [lXMF](https://github.com/markqvist/LXMF) ecosystem, designed to manage a complete TCP node across a Reticulum-based network.
RTH enables communication and data sharing between clients like [Sideband](https://github.com/markqvist/Sideband) or Meshchat, enhancing situational awareness and operational efficiency in distributed networks.

## Core Functionalities

The Reticulum-Telemetry-Hub can perform the following key functions:

- **One to Many & Topic-Targeted Messages**: RTH supports broadcasting messages to all connected clients or filtering the fan-out by topic tags maintained in the hub's subscriber registry.
- By sending a message to the hub, it will be distributed to all clients connected to the network or, when the payload includes a `TopicID`, only to the peers subscribed to that topic. *(Initial implementation - Experimental)*
- **Telemetry Collector**: RTH acts as a telemetry data repository, collecting data from all connected clients. Currently, this functionality is focused on Sideband clients that have enabled their Reticulum identity. By rewriting the code we hope to see a wider implementation of telemetry in other applications.
- **Lightweight Topic Managemnt** : Ability to create topics and to distribute messages to users subscribed to the topic
- **Replication Node**: RTH uses the LXMF router to ensure message delivery even when the target client is offline. If a message's destination is not available at the time of sending, RTH will save the message and deliver it once the client comes online.
- **Reticulum Transport**: RTH uses Reticulum as a transport node, routing traffic to other peers, passing network announcements, and fulfilling path requests.
- **File and Image Attachments**: RTH stores inbound files/images sent over LXMF, catalogs them by ID, and serves them back on demand. Clients can list stored items (`ListFiles`, `ListImages`) and retrieve them (`RetrieveFile`, `RetrieveImage`) with the binary payload delivered in LXMF fields so Sideband, Meshchat, and similar tools can save them directly.
- **TAK Server Integration**: if configured, RTH sends chat and telemetry to a TAK server. 

## Documentation

- Command payload formats and examples: [`docs/supportedCommands.md`](docs/supportedCommands.md)
- REST/OpenAPI reference (REST maps to LXMF commands): [`API/ReticulumTelemetryHub-OAS.yaml`](API/ReticulumTelemetryHub-OAS.yaml)
- [User Manual](/docs/userManual.md)
- TAK / Cursor-on-Target integration: [`docs/tak.md`](docs/tak.md)
- File and image workflows: see the "Exchanging attachments over LXMF" section below.

## Admin UI API

The admin UI uses REST + WebSocket endpoints. Every REST endpoint maps to an
LXMF command, and all LXMF commands are exposed over REST. Commands are split
into **Public** (end users) and **Protected** (admin UI).

See the OpenAPI document in `API/ReticulumTelemetryHub-OAS.yaml` for the
complete REST surface, including:

- `GET /Status`, `GET /Events`
- `GET /Telemetry?since=<unix>&topic_id=<TopicID>`
- `GET /Config`, `PUT /Config`, `POST /Config/Validate`, `POST /Config/Rollback`
- `GET /Identities`, `POST /Client/{id}/Ban`, `POST /Client/{id}/Unban`, `POST /Client/{id}/Blackhole`

## Quickstart

Follow these steps to bring up a local hub using the bundled defaults:

1. Clone the repository and enter it.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/Reticulum-Telemetry-Hub.git
   cd Reticulum-Telemetry-Hub
   ```
2. Create and activate a virtual environment.
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
   You should see `(.venv)` in your shell prompt after activation.
3. Install dependencies in editable mode (or use Poetry if you prefer).
   ```bash
   pip install --upgrade pip
   pip install -e .
   ```
   The editable install pulls every dependency declared in `pyproject.toml` (including runtime services, the optional `gpsdclient` GPS integration, and the bundled tests). Core dependencies now include `python-dotenv` for environment loading, `qrcode` for QR payload rendering, and `PyNaCl` for stamp generation. If you prefer Poetry, run `pip install poetry` once and then use `poetry install` to create and manage the virtual environment instead.
4. Prepare a storage directory and unified config (the defaults live under `RTH_Store`).
   - Copy `config.ini` into `RTH_Store` or point the `--storage_dir` flag at another directory.
   - See the [Configuration](#configuration) section below for the available options and defaults.
5. Run the lightweight smoke checks to confirm the entry point and daemon wiring.
   ```bash
   python -m reticulum_telemetry_hub.reticulum_server --help
   pytest tests/test_reticulum_server_daemon.py -q
   ```
6. Start the hub.
   ```bash
   python -m reticulum_telemetry_hub.reticulum_server \
       --storage_dir ./RTH_Store \
       --display_name "RTH"
   ```

## Installation

Install RTH from PyPI inside a virtual environment:

1. Create the virtual environment.
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   ```
2. Activate it.
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   source .venv/bin/activate

   # Windows (PowerShell)
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
3. Install from PyPI.
   ```bash
   python -m pip install --upgrade pip
   python -m pip install ReticulumTelemetryHub
   ```

If you want the full installation steps outside the quickstart (for example, installing from source), follow the commands above. *Optional extras*: No extras are currently defined, so the commands above install the complete feature set out of the box.

### Verify the setup

After installation, run a quick smoke test to confirm the environment is wired correctly:

```bash
# Show the available runtime flags and ensure the entry point loads
python -m reticulum_telemetry_hub.reticulum_server --help

# Run the lightweight daemon test (optional, but verifies command handling)
pytest tests/test_reticulum_server_daemon.py -q
```



## Configuration

RTH now uses a unified runtime configuration file alongside the Reticulum/LXMF configs. Defaults live under `RTH_Store`, but you can point at another storage directory with `--storage_dir` (the hub will look for `config.ini` there).

### Unified runtime config (`config.ini`)

Create `RTH_Store/config.ini` (or place it in your chosen storage directory). CLI flags always override the file, and the file overrides built-in defaults.

If you do not set explicit locations, RTH creates `files/` and `images/` folders inside the storage directory for general file storage and decoded imagery. Override them in the `[files]` or `[images]` sections if you want to place them elsewhere.

```ini
[hub]
display_name = RTH
announce_interval = 60           # seconds
hub_telemetry_interval = 600     # seconds
service_telemetry_interval = 900 # seconds
log_level = debug
embedded_lxmd = false            # set true to run the embedded router
services = tak_cot, gpsd         # comma-separated default services
reticulum_config_path = ~/.reticulum/config
lxmf_router_config_path = ~/.lxmd/config
telemetry_filename = telemetry.ini

[reticulum]
enable_transport = true
share_instance = true

[interfaces]
type = TCPServerInterface
interface_enabled = true
listen_ip = 0.0.0.0
listen_port = 4242

[propagation]
enable_node = yes
announce_interval = 10           # minutes
propagation_transfer_max_accepted_size = 1024

[lxmf]
display_name = RTH_router

[gpsd]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 2947

[files]
# path = /var/lib/rth/files     # defaults to <storage_dir>/files

[images]
# directory = /var/lib/rth/img  # defaults to <storage_dir>/images

[TAK]
cot_url = tcp://127.0.0.1:8087
callsign = RTH
poll_interval_seconds = 30
# tls_client_cert = /path/to/cert.pem
# tls_client_key  = /path/to/key.pem
# tls_ca          = /path/to/ca.pem
# tls_insecure    = true
```

How the unified config is used:

- `HubConfigurationManager` loads `config.ini` into a single runtime view (`HubRuntimeConfig` stored on `HubAppConfig`).
- Reticulum and LXMF settings can be supplied directly in `config.ini`, or you can point to existing config files via `[hub].reticulum_config_path` / `[hub].lxmf_router_config_path`.
- File and image storage directories default to `<storage_dir>/files` and `<storage_dir>/images`, but can be overridden via the `[files]` and `[images]` sections.
- TAK, GPSD, announce/telemetry intervals, default services, log level, and embedded/external LXMF choices are all centralized here.
- GPSD integration relies on the `gpsdclient` dependency (bundled in the install) and an accessible gpsd instance at the configured host/port.
- CLI flags (`--storage_dir`, `--config`, `--display-name`, `--announce-interval`, `--embedded`, `--service`, etc.) override any values loaded from the file.

### File and image metadata API

The Python API exposes helpers to track stored files and images alongside their metadata (paths, MIME types, categories, sizes, and timestamps). Use these calls after you place files under the configured storage directories:

- `ReticulumTelemetryHubAPI.store_file(path, name=None, media_type=None)` records a file in the default `files/` directory.
- `ReticulumTelemetryHubAPI.store_image(path, name=None, media_type=None)` records an image in the `images/` directory.
- `list_files()` / `list_images()` return stored metadata filtered by category.
- `retrieve_file(id)` / `retrieve_image(id)` return a single record by ID, raising `KeyError` when the category does not match.

File and image directories still default to `<storage_dir>/files` and `<storage_dir>/images`, but you can point them elsewhere via the `[files]` and `[images]` sections as shown above.

### Exchanging attachments over LXMF

- LXMF clients can discover stored artifacts with `ListFiles` and `ListImages` commands and fetch them with `RetrieveFile` / `RetrieveImage`. List responses include `TopicID` when one is tagged, and retrieval replies include metadata in the message body **and** ship the binary payloads in the LXMF-standard fields (`FIELD_FILE_ATTACHMENTS` for files, `FIELD_IMAGE` for images) so Sideband, Meshchat, and similar tools can save them without extra parsing.
- Attachment payloads are sent in list form for client compatibility: `["filename.ext", <bytes>, "mime/type"]`. Images include `FIELD_IMAGE` and are also mirrored in `FIELD_FILE_ATTACHMENTS`.
- Incoming LXMF messages that already include `FIELD_FILE_ATTACHMENTS` or `FIELD_IMAGE` fields are persisted automatically to the configured storage directories. Tag attachments by including `TopicID` in the command payload or by sending `AssociateTopicID`. The hub replies with the assigned index so you can reference the attachment in subsequent retrievals.

## Service

In order to start the RTH   automatically on startup, we will need to install a /etc/systemd/system/RTH.service file:

``` ini
[Unit]
Description=Reticulum Telemetry Hub
After=network-online.target
Wants=network-online.target

[Service]
ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/RTH
Restart=on-failure
User=root  # Change this if you run RTH as a non-root user
WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin  # Adjust to where RTH is located
ExecReload=/bin/kill -HUP $MAINPID

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
```

## Usage

Enable and start the service: Once the service file is created, run the following commands to enable and start the service:

```bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable RTH.service
sudo systemctl start RTH.service
```

Ensure your Reticulum network  is operational and configure for the full functionality of RTH.
Once installed and configured, you can start the Reticulum-Telemetry-Hub directly from the package entry point:

```bash
# from the repository root
python -m reticulum_telemetry_hub.reticulum_server \
    --storage_dir ./RTH_Store \
    --display_name "RTH" \
    [--daemon --service gpsd]
```

### Sending commands with parameters

RTH consumes LXMF commands from the `Commands` field (numeric field ID `9`). Each command is a JSON object inside that array and may include either the string key `Command` or the numeric key `0` (`PLUGIN_COMMAND`) for the command name. The server now accepts the following shapes:

- A plain JSON object: `[{"Command": "join"}]`
- A JSON string that parses to an object: `[ "{\"Command\": \"join\"}" ]`
- Sideband-style numeric wrapper that RTH unwraps automatically: `[{"0": "{\"Command\":\"join\"}"}]`
- An escape-prefixed message body when you cannot populate the `Commands` field:
  - Plain text: ``\\\join`` (RTH wraps this as `[{"Command":"join"}]`)
  - JSON: ``\\\{"Command":"CreateTopic","TopicName":"Weather","TopicPath":"environment/weather"}``

Unregistered LXMF senders automatically receive a ``getAppInfo`` reply containing
the app name, version, and description from the ``[app]`` section of
``config.ini`` so they can identify the hub before joining.

Parameters are provided alongside the command name in the same object. RTH tolerates common casing differences (`TopicID`, `topic_id`, `topic_id`, etc.) and will prompt for anything still missing.

**Typical commands with parameters**

```json
[{"Command": "CreateTopic", "TopicName": "Weather", "TopicPath": "environment/weather"}]
```

```json
[{"Command": "SubscribeTopic", "TopicID": "<TopicID>", "RejectTests": true, "Metadata": {"role": "field-station"}}]
```

```json
[{"Command": "PatchTopic", "TopicID": "<TopicID>", "TopicDescription": "New description"}]
```

You can stack multiple commands by adding more objects to the array. If a required field is missing, the hub will ask for it and keep the partially supplied values. Reply with another command object that includes the missing fields--RTH merges it with your earlier attempt:

1. Send a partial command: `[{"Command": "CreateTopic", "TopicName": "Weather"}]`
2. The hub replies asking for `TopicPath` and shows an example.
3. Reply with the missing field only (or the full payload): `[{"Command": "CreateTopic", "TopicPath": "environment/weather"}]`

The full list of supported command names (with examples) is in `docs/supportedCommands.md`; the in-code reference lives in `reticulum_telemetry_hub/reticulum_server/command_text.py`.

### Topic-targeted broadcasts

RTH keeps a lightweight topic registry via its API, letting operators create topics, add subscribers and limit message delivery to interested peers. Use the `CreateTopic`/`ListTopic` commands to define topic IDs and describe them. Connected clients can then issue the `SubscribeTopic` command so the hub records their LXMF destination hashes under the appropriate topic.

To create a topic, send a `CreateTopic` command payload. For example, Sideband operators commonly issue:

```json
{"Command": "CreateTopic","TopicName": "Weather", "TopicPath": "environment/weather"}
```

This is the exact payload the hub expects (`reticulum_telemetry_hub/reticulum_server/command_manager.py:424-431`), so any LXMF client can reuse it when spawning new operational channels.

RTH  also tolerates Sideband's positional fallback that shows up in logs like `Fields: {9: {0: "CreateTopic", 1: "Weather", 2: "environment/weather"}}`. The hub maps the numeric positions into the expected fields for known commands, so the payload above is treated the same as the JSON example earlier.

Any message sent to the hub that includes a `TopicID` (in the LXMF fields or a command payload) will only be forwarded to the subscribers registered for that topic. The hub automatically refreshes the registry from the API, so new subscriptions take effect without restarting the process.

### Telemetry requests

Send `TelemetryRequest` (numeric key `1`) to fetch recent telemetry snapshots.
You may include `TopicID` to scope results; the hub will only return telemetry
for peers subscribed to that topic and will deny requests from non-subscribers.
The hub replies with:

- A `FIELD_TELEMETRY_STREAM` field containing msgpack-encoded snapshots (Sideband-compatible).
- A message body containing JSON with a human-readable `telemetry` array (peer hash, timestamp, decoded sensors).

See `docs/example_telemetry.json` for a sample response body.

### Unified configuration (``config.ini``)

RTH reads defaults from a single ``config.ini`` file located in the storage directory (or an alternate path supplied via ``--config``). Command-line flags still win at runtime, but the file keeps every parameter—telemetry cadence, TAK settings, telemetry synthesis and service options—in one place.

Example configuration:

```ini
[app]
name = Reticulum Telemetry Hub
version = 0.63.0
description = Public-facing hub for the mesh network

[hub]
display_name = RTH
announce_interval = 60
hub_telemetry_interval = 600
service_telemetry_interval = 900
log_level = debug
embedded_lxmd = false
services = gpsd, tak_cot
telemetry_filename = telemetry.ini

[TAK]
cot_url = tcp://127.0.0.1:8087
callsign = RTH
poll_interval_seconds = 30
tls_client_cert =
tls_client_key =
tls_ca =
tls_insecure = false
tak_proto = 0
fts_compat = 1

[gpsd]
host = 127.0.0.1
port = 2947

[telemetry]
synthesize_location = true
location_latitude = 44.0
location_longitude = -63.0
location_altitude = 10.0
location_accuracy = 5.0
static_information = Callsign RTH
enable_battery = yes

[files]
path = /var/lib/rth/files

[images]
directory = /var/lib/rth/images
```

TAK servers typically expect TCP unicast connections. Keep ``cot_url`` in the
``tcp://host:port`` format and use ``tak_proto = 0`` (TAK XML) with
``fts_compat = 1`` to match PyTAK's compatibility guidance.

Values omitted from the file fall back to the built-in defaults listed below. The telemetry section mirrors the prior ``telemetry.ini`` format so existing files remain compatible.

### Command-line options

| Flag | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `--config` | Path to ``config.ini`` (defaults to ``<storage_dir>/config.ini``). |
| `--storage_dir` | Directory that holds LXMF storage and the hub identity (defaults to `./RTH_Store`). |
| `--display_name` | Human-readable label announced with your LXMF destination (defaults to `[hub].display_name`). |
| `--announce-interval` | Seconds between LXMF identity announcements (defaults to `[hub].announce_interval`). |
| `--hub-telemetry-interval` | Seconds between local telemetry snapshots (defaults to `[hub].hub_telemetry_interval`). |
| `--service-telemetry-interval` | Seconds between service collector polls (defaults to `[hub].service_telemetry_interval`). |
| `--embedded/--no-embedded` | Run the LXMF daemon in-process (defaults to `[hub].embedded_lxmd`). |
| `--daemon` | Enable daemon mode so the hub samples telemetry autonomously. |
| `--service NAME` | Enable optional daemon services such as `gpsd` (repeat the flag for multiple services). Defaults to `[hub].services`. |

### Embedded vs. external ``lxmd``

RTH can rely on an external ``lxmd`` process (the default) or it can host the
delivery/propagation threads internally via the ``--embedded``/``--embedded-lxmd``
flag. Choose the mode that best matches your deployment:

* **External daemon (default)** - ideal for production installs that already run
  Reticulum infrastructure. Keep your Reticulum/LXMF daemons configured with
  their normal files (``~/.reticulum/config`` and ``~/.lxmd/config``) and mirror
  those values into ``config.ini`` so the hub reflects the same settings. Use
  your init system (for example ``systemd``) to keep ``lxmd`` alive. The hub
  connects to that router and benefits from the daemon's storage limits and
  lifecycle management.
* **Embedded ``lxmd``** - useful for development, CI or constrained hosts where
  running a companion service is impractical. Launch the server with
  ``python -m reticulum_telemetry_hub.reticulum_server --embedded`` (combine it
  with ``--storage_dir`` to point at a temporary workspace). The embedded daemon
  reads its values from ``config.ini`` via the ``HubConfigurationManager`` and
  automatically persists telemetry snapshots emitted by the LXMF router. Tweak
  the ``[propagation]`` settings in the file (announce interval, enable_node,
  etc.) to control in-process behaviour.

### Daemon mode & services



Passing `--daemon` tells the hub to spin up the `TelemetrySampler` along with any
services requested via `--service`. The sampler periodically snapshots the local
`TelemeterManager`, persists the payload and republishes it to every connected
client without manual intervention. Additional services (for example `gpsd`)
run in their own threads and update specialized sensors when the host hardware
is present. Each service self-identifies whether it can start so the daemon can
gracefully run on hardware that lacks certain peripherals.

These background workers honor the normal `shutdown()` lifecycle hooks, making
it safe to run the hub under `systemd`, `supervisord` or similar process
managers. `pytest tests/test_reticulum_server_daemon.py -q` exercises the daemon
mode in CI and verifies that it collects telemetry automatically.

### TAK/CoT connector

Use the `tak_cot` service to push location updates to a TAK endpoint over
Cursor-on-Target. The hub polls the latest `location` sensor snapshot and
transmits it via PyTAK with the configured callsign and TLS settings. Enable the
service with the CLI flag and customize its behavior through the `[TAK]` section
in ``config.ini``.

Signed chat messages delivered over LXMF are also mirrored into CoT chat events
when they include non-telemetry content. Remarks carry the chat body and topic
identifier to maintain topic-aware routing inside TAK tools.

PyTAK connections reuse a single persistent CLI session with shared queues so
chat and telemetry dispatches do not restart sockets on every send. The
connector also schedules both takPong and hello/ping keepalives using the
``keepalive_interval_seconds`` option (or ``--keepalive`` flag) to keep TAK
endpoints responsive.

Example: `python -m reticulum_telemetry_hub.reticulum_server --daemon --service tak_cot`.

#### Configuring the TAK integration

1. Ensure PyTAK is installed in the same environment as RTH (`pip install pytak` is already declared as a dependency).
2. Populate the `[TAK]` section in ``config.ini`` with your endpoint details (see the example above). Flags override file values if you need a one-off change.
3. Start the hub with the TAK service enabled (combine with `--embedded` if you are not running an external `lxmd`):
   `python -m reticulum_telemetry_hub.reticulum_server --daemon --service tak_cot`
4. Provide a location feed so the connector has something to send. The hub will use the latest `location` sensor reading (for example from the `gpsd` service: `--service gpsd`), or any location telemetry already present in the database.
5. Watch the logs for successful CoT dispatches; failures will be logged with the TAK connector error message.
