This module provides the following features:

- Adds a Customer Order Number to sale order lines and propagates the value to
  invoice lines.
- Allows the Customer Order Number to be displayed in both sale and invoice
  reports.

This module is useful in cases where a single sales order represents multiple
customer orders.
