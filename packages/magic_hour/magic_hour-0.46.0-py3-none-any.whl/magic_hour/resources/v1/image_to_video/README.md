### Image To Video Generate Workflow <a name="generate"></a>

The workflow performs the following action

1. upload local assets to Magic Hour storage. So you can pass in a local path instead of having to upload files yourself
2. trigger a generation
3. poll for a completion status. This is configurable
4. if success, download the output to local directory

> [!TIP]
> This is the recommended way to use the SDK unless you have specific needs where it is necessary to split up the actions.

#### Parameters

In Additional to the parameters listed in the `.create` section below, `.generate` introduces 3 new parameters:

- `wait_for_completion` (bool, default True): Whether to wait for the project to complete.
- `download_outputs` (bool, default True): Whether to download the generated files
- `download_directory` (str, optional): Directory to save downloaded files (defaults to current directory)

#### Synchronous Client

```python
from magic_hour import Client
from os import getenv

client = Client(token=getenv("API_TOKEN"))
res = client.v1.image_to_video.generate(
    assets={"image_file_path": "/path/to/1234.png"},
    end_seconds=5.0,
    name="Image To Video video",
    resolution="720p",
    wait_for_completion=True,
    download_outputs=True,
    download_directory="outputs"
)
```

#### Asynchronous Client

```python
from magic_hour import AsyncClient
from os import getenv

client = AsyncClient(token=getenv("API_TOKEN"))
res = await client.v1.image_to_video.generate(
    assets={"image_file_path": "/path/to/1234.png"},
    end_seconds=5.0,
    name="Image To Video video",
    resolution="720p",
    wait_for_completion=True,
    download_outputs=True,
    download_directory="outputs"
)
```

### Image-to-Video <a name="create"></a>

**What this API does**

Create the same Image To Video you can make in the browser, but programmatically, so you can automate it, run it at scale, or connect it to your own app or workflow.

**Good for**

- Automation and batch processing
- Adding image to video into apps, pipelines, or tools

**How it works (3 steps)**

1. Upload your inputs (video, image, or audio) with [Generate Upload URLs](https://docs.magichour.ai/api-reference/files/generate-asset-upload-urls) and copy the `file_path`.
2. Send a request to create a image to video job with the basic fields.
3. Check the job status until it's `complete`, then download the result from `downloads`.

**Key options**

- Inputs: usually a file, sometimes a YouTube link, depending on project type
- Resolution: free users are limited to 576px; higher plans unlock HD and larger sizes
- Extra fields: e.g. `face_swap_mode`, `start_seconds`/`end_seconds`, or a text prompt

**Cost**\
Credits are only charged for the frames that actually render. You'll see an estimate when the job is queued, and the final total after it's done.

For detailed examples, see the [product page](https://magichour.ai/products/image-to-video).

**API Endpoint**: `POST /v1/image-to-video`
