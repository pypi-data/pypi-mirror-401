        Image-to-Video

        **What this API does**

        Create the same Image To Video you can make in the browser, but programmatically, so you can automate it, run it at scale, or connect it to your own app or workflow.

        **Good for**
        - Automation and batch processing
        - Adding image to video into apps, pipelines, or tools

        **How it works (3 steps)**
        1) Upload your inputs (video, image, or audio) with [Generate Upload URLs](https://docs.magichour.ai/api-reference/files/generate-asset-upload-urls) and copy the `file_path`.
        2) Send a request to create a image to video job with the basic fields.
        3) Check the job status until it's `complete`, then download the result from `downloads`.

        **Key options**
        - Inputs: usually a file, sometimes a YouTube link, depending on project type
        - Resolution: free users are limited to 576px; higher plans unlock HD and larger sizes
        - Extra fields: e.g. `face_swap_mode`, `start_seconds`/`end_seconds`, or a text prompt

        **Cost**
        Credits are only charged for the frames that actually render. You'll see an estimate when the job is queued, and the final total after it's done.

        For detailed examples, see the [product page](https://magichour.ai/products/image-to-video).

        POST /v1/image-to-video

        Output resolution is determined by the **minimum** of:
        - The resolution of the input video
        - The maximum resolution allowed by your subscription tier. See our [pricing page](https://magichour.ai/pricing) for more details.

        This field is retained only for backward compatibility and will be removed in a future release.
            name: Give your video a custom name for easy identification.

        480p and 720p are available on Creator, Pro, or Business tiers. However, 1080p require Pro or Business tier.

        **Options:**
        - `480p` - Supports only 5 or 10 second videos. Output: 24fps. Cost: 120 credits per 5 seconds.
        - `720p` - Supports videos between 5-60 seconds. Output: 30fps. Cost: 300 credits per 5 seconds.
        - `1080p` - Supports videos between 5-60 seconds. Output: 30fps. Cost: 600 credits per 5 seconds.
