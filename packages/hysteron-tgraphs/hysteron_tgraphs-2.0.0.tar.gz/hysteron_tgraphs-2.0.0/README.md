The code in this repository was published in conjunction with the article "Transition Graphs of Interacting Hysterons: Structure, Design, Organisation and Statistics" by Margot H. Teunisse and Martin van Hecke for Royal Society Open Science (2025). 

The notebook 'walkthrough.ipynb' in the repository github.com/MargotHTeunisse/hysteron-tgraphs reproduces the results detailed in the article.

# Getting Started

To import this software, first install it from PyPI by running 

```console

pip install hysteron_tgraphs

```
## Dependencies

The core functionalities of this code are compatible with

Python >= 3.12

Numpy >= 1.26.4

Scipy >= 1.13.1

## Optional features

These modules have additional dependencies which can be specified on installation, e.g. by running 


```console

pip install hysteron_tgraphs[plotting]

```

**plotting**

Contains functions for visualizing transition graphs and switching fields. Requires Matplotlib >= 3.9.2. 

**graph-analysis**

Currently only used to remove Garden-of-Eden states. Requires NetworkX >= 3.3.

**polyhedron-analysis**

***Not recommended for most use cases.*** Calculates the probability of a transition graph by calculating the volume of the corresponding polyhedron. Uses Pycddlib 2.1.8.post1.
