# The base class for all images.  This is not useful by itself, you need

#   class.

    Properties inclue the following.  Some of these properties may not
    be defined for some subclasses of Image.

    If possible, avoid using all "path" properties, and instead use the
    other properties to get access to image data.  Note that "noisepath"
    and "flagspath" are not defined for all Image subclasses, and will
    only be defined sometimes for some subclasses (depending on how data
    is stored).

    * filepath : pathlib.Path ; path *relative to the base path* of the image file. This may just
                                have the image data itself, or it may be a *base* filepath, or it
                                may have everything, depending on the subclass.
                                If you can avoid using this property, do so.  Use .data, etc, instead.
    * filename : string ; just the name part of filepath (so if filepath is Path("/foo/bar"), name is "bar")
    * full_filepath : pathlib.Path ; absolute path to file on system.  (Same as base_path / filepath.)
    * base_path : base path for images; usually will be Config value system.paths.images
    * base_dir : synonym for base_path

    * path : pathlib.Path; absolute path to the image on disk, sort of, in a complicatd way.
             HERE FOR BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY ONLY
    * name : str; synonym for filename.  HERE FOR BACKWARDS COMPATIBILITY ONLY.

    * pointing : int (str?); a unique identifier of the exposure associated with the image
    *            WARNING, this property name will probably change once we fighre out the
    *            right thing from the roman datamodel we want to use
    * sca : int (str?); the SCA of this image
    * ra: float; the nominal RA at the center of the image in decimal degrees, usu. from the header
    * dec: float; the nominal RA at the center of the image in decimal degrees, usu. from the header
    * ra_corner_00: float; decimal degrees, ra of pixel (0, 0)
    * ra_corner_10: float; decimal degrees, ra of pixel (width-1, 0)
    * ra_corner_01: float; decimal degrees, ra of pixel (0, height)

    * dec_corner_10: float; decimal degrees, dec of pixel (width-1, 0)
    * dec_corner_01: float; decimal degrees, dec of pixel (0, height)
    * dec_corner_11: float; decimal degrees, dec of pixel (width-1, height-1)
    * band : str; filter
    * mjd : float; mjd of the start of the image
    * position_angle : float; position angle in degrees north of east (CHECK THIS)
    * exptime : float; exposure time in seconds
    * sky_level : float; an estimate of the sky level (in ADU) if known, None otherwise
    * zeropoint : float; convert to AB mag with -2.5*log(adu) + zeropoint, where adu is the units of data

    * width : the width (xorizontal size as viewed on ds9) of the image in pixels
    * height : the height (y/vertical size as viewed on ds9) of the image in pixels
    * image_shape : tuple (height, width) of ints; the image size
    * coord_center : tuple of (ra, dec) [I THINK] : center of the image calculated from the WCS

    * data : 2d numpy array; the data of this image
    * noise : 2d numpy array; a 1σ noise image (if defined)
    * flags : 2d numpy array of ints; a pixel flags image (if defined)

    IMPORTANT NOTE: because of how numpy arrays are indexed, if you want to get
    value of the pixel at (ix, iy), you would do image.data[iy, ix].

    For all implementations, the properties data, noise, and flags are
    lazy-loaded.  That is, they start empty, but when you access them,
    an internal buffer gets loaded with that data.  This means it can be
    very easy for lots of memory to get used without your realizing it.
    There are a couple of solutions.  The first, is to call Image.free()
    when you're sure you don't need the data any more, or if you know
    you want to get rid of it for a while and re-read it from disk
    later.  The second is just not to access the data, noise, and flags
    properties, instead use Image.get_data(), and manage the data object
    lifetime yourself.

        """Instantiate an image.  You probably don't want to do that.

        This is an abstract base class that has limited functionality.
        You probably want to instantiate a subclass if you're creating a
        new image.

        If you're trying to pull an image out of the database, then
        probably what you really want is to use the Image.get_image or
        Image.find_images class methods.

        If you're working with non-database images and are trying to get
        a pre-existing image, then probably what you really want to do
        is call the get_image() method of an ImageCollection object.

        Parameters
        ----------
          filepath : str or Path, default None
            Path of the image relative to the base path for images,
            unless less no_base_path is True, in which case this is the
            full absolute path to the image.  For datbase images, you do
            not want to create a path yourself, but leave it at None and
            let the class create the filepath.  See PathedObject.

          full_filepath : str or Path, default None
            The full path to the image.  If you're using an Image subclass
            to deal with an image that's not in the database, you probably
            want to set this to the absolute path of the image, and you
            probably want to set no_base_path to True, but you might also
            set base_path yourself and leave no_base_path at False.

          base_path : str or Path, default None
            Always leave this at None for images associated with
            database, and the default will be used.  Otherwise, the
            absolute path of the image is base_path / filepath (which
            should be exactly the same as full_filepath).  Must be None
            if no_base_path is True.

          base_dir : str or Path, default None
            Synonym for base_path

          no_base_path : bool, default False
            For images associated with the database, leave this at
            False, and make filepath relative to the base path (which
            may be system dependent).  For images that aren't associated
            with the database, you can make this True and set filepath
            to be just the path to the image.

          id : UUID or str that can be converted to UUID, default None
            Database ID of the image.  This is only relevant if the
            image is in the l2image table of the Roman SNPIT internal
            database (but is required in that case).

          provenance_id : UUID or str that can be converted to UUID, default NOne
            The id of the provenance of the image.  Only relevant if the
            image is in the l2image table of the Roman SNPIT internal
            database (but is required in that case).

          width, height: int, default None
            The width and height of the image in pixels if known.

          format : int, default -1
            Index into the table Image._format_def at the bottom of this file.

          pointing : int (str?), default None (WARNING: this parameter keyword will change)
          sca: int, default None
          ra: float, default None
          dec: float, default None
          (ra|dec)_corner_(00|01|10|11): float, default None
          band: str, default None
          mjd: float, default None
          position_angle: float, default None
          exptime: float, default None
          sky_level: float, default None
          zeropoint: float, default None
            All of these are the values that should be set for these
            properties (see Image class docstring).  If they are None,
            how they get populated depends on the image subclass.  In
            many cases, they will be lazy-loaded from the header.

# A base class for FITSImages which use an AstropyWCS wcs.
#
# There are three basic models for how the FITS image is stored on disk:
#
# (1) Multiple HDUs in one file
#
#     In this case, filepath holds the path to the file (full_filepath for the
#     full location), and imagehdu, nosiehdu, and flagshdu hold the index of
#     the hdu that has the respective data array.  noisepath and flagspath are
#     None.  If you get the FITS header, you get the header associated with
#     the imagehdu... which might not be what you want, but oh well.
#
# (2) Three separate files
#
#     In thise case, imagepath, noisepath, and flagspath properties are the
#     full absolute paths to the image data, noise data, and dq flags
#     respectively.  Usually, though not necessarily, all of imagehdu,
#     noisehdu, and flagshdu will be 0, since we are dealing with single-hdu
#     files.  The filepath property holds *something* relative to the base
#     path, depending on details, but it might be the image data.  If you
#     get the header, you get the image file's header.
#
# (3) One file with just data
#     There is no noise or flags, just data.
#
# If constructed with std_imagenames=True, then this assumes model (2), and
#   full_filepath should be a _base_ name; the data is in
#   {full_filepath}_image.fits, the noise in {full_filepath}_noise.fits, and
#   the flags in {full_filepath}_flags.fits.
