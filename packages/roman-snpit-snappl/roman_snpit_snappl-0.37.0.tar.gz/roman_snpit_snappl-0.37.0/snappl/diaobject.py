class DiaObject:
    """Encapsulate a single supernova (or other transient).

    Standard properties:

    id : UUID; the id of the object if it is in the SNPIT Internal database (or intended to be)
    provenance_id : UUID; the provenance of the object if it is in the SNPIT Internal database (or intended to be)

    name : str; some name assigned by the thing that found it.  These
           will be heterogeneous, may be duplciated for different
           objects, and may be None, so don't rely on this property as
           an identifier.  View it as more a comment field.
    iauname : str; the IAU or TNS name for the object, if know, and if the field has been populated.
              Will be None for most objects.

    ra : ra in degrees (ICRS)
    dec : dec in degrees (ICRS)
          The ra/dec position should be considered an _approximate_
          position only.  It's the position that was saved when the
          object was first found, which means it was probably well
          before peak and likely a low S/N detection.  Use
          get_position() with an appropriate provenance to find a better
          position for an object (if we've calcaulted one).

    mjd_discovery : when the object was first discovered; may be None if unknown (float MJD)
    mjd_peak : peak of the object's lightcurve; may be None if unknown (float MJD)

    mjd_start : MJD when the lightcurve first exists.  Definition of this
                is class-dependent; it may be when it was actively
                simulated, but it may be when the lightcurve is above some
                cutoff.  May be None if unknown.

    mjd_end : MJD when the lightcurve stops existing.  Definition like
              mjd_start.  May be None if unknown.

    properties : dictionary of additional properties.  DO NOT RELY ON
                 THIS HAVING ANY PARTICULAR KEYS.  Different
                 provenances, and maybe even different objects within
                 the same provenance, may have different keys in this
                 dictionary.  This is more to be used for debugging
                 purposes.  (If there is an additional key that every
                 object should have, we should add it as a top-level
                 property, and add that column to the database.)

    Usually, don't instantiate one of these directly.  Instead, use
    DiaObject.get_object or DiaObject.find_objects.  If you're trying to
    get a manual object, use provenance_tag 'manual' with
    DiaObject.get_object.  Only instantiate a DiaObject if you're
    writing discovery software and want to create a new one to save to
    the database.

        ----------
          id : UUID or str, default None.
            The id of the diaobject.  If you leave this as None
            (recommended), a new one will be assigned.

          provenance_id : UUID or str
            The provenance of the object. Required if you're going to save
            this to the database later.

          ra : float
            Decimal degrees.

          dec : float
            Decimal degrees.

          name : str, defanot None
            A name for the object.  These aren't strictly required to be
            unique, but you should strive to make them unique.
            Normally, saving them will raise an error if you end up with
            more than one object in the same provenance with the same
            name.  Ideally, this is something digestable for humans, but
            if you're lazy, you can make this a string version of id and
            then you can be sure it will be unique.  You may also just
            leave it at Hone.

          iauname : str, default None
            The IAU / TNS name for the object.  If given, this must be
            unique within a given provenance, though it's OK if it's
            None.

          mjd_discovery : float
            MJD when the object was found.  Required.

          mjd_peak : float, default None
            MJD when the object is at peak.  Optional

          mjd_start : float, default None
            MJD when the transient starts.  This means that any images
            from an earlier MJD are suitable for use as a template.  Optional.

          mjd_end : float, default None
            MJD when the tranient "ends".  Physically, this is
            meaningless, but practically, it means that any images from
            a later MJD are suitable for use as a template.  Optional.

          ndetected : int, default 1
            The number of times this object has been detected.  When
            creating a new DiaObject, you usually want this to be 1 (the
            default) unless you really know what you're doing.  When a
            DiaObject has been loaded from the database, this will have
            the number in the corresponding database column.

              * manual : manually create objects

         provenance: Provenance, UUID, or UUIDifiable str, default None
            The provenance of the object you're looking for.  You don't
            need this if you pass provenance_tag and process, or if you
            pass diaobject_id.  Invalid if collection is not 'snpitdb'.

         provenance_tag : str, default None
           The human-readable provenance tag for the provenance of objects
           you want to dig through.  Requires 'process'.  You must
           specify at least one of provenance_Tag or provenance.
           Invalid if collection is not 'snpitdb'.

         process : str, default None
           The process associated with the provenance_tag (needed to
           determine a unique provenance id).  Needed if provenance_tag
           is not None.

         diaobject_id : UUID or str, default None
           The diaobject_id of the object to get.  Invalid if collection
           is not 'snpitdb'.

         name : str (usually; might be an int for some provenance_tags)
           The name of the object as determined by whoever it was that
           was making the mess when loading objects into the database.
           This is not guaranteed to be unique.  However, if you know
           what you're doing, it may be useful.  If you are happy
           receiving all the objects for a given provenance with the
           same name, set multiple_ok to True; otherwise, it'll be an
           error if more than one object has the same name.

         iauname : str
           The iau/tns name of the object you want to find.  These are
           guaranteed to be unique within a given provenance.

         diaobject_id : UUID or str or maybe something else
           The Romamn SNPIT internal database id of the object you want.
           If you specify this, you don't need anything else.  If you
           also give one of (provenance_id, provenance_tag and process,
           collection and subset), then this method will verify that the
           object_id you're looking for is within the right provenance.

         multiple_ok : bool, default False
           Only matters if you specify name instead of object_id or
           iauname.  Ignored if you don't specify name.  See Returns.

         dbclient : SNPITDBClient, default None
           The database web api connection object to use.  If you don't
           specify one, a new one will be made based on what's in your
           configuration.

        Returns
        -------
          DiaObject or list of DiaObject

          If you specify name and you set multiple_ok=True, then you get
          a list of DiaObject back.  Otherwise, you get a single one.
          If no object is found with your criteria, a RuntimeError
          exception will be raised.

        Parameters
        ----------
         collection : str, default 'snpitdb'
            Which collection of objects to search.  Options are:
              * snpitdb : use the Roman SNPIT Internal DB as defined in Config
                          This requires either provenance_id, or provenance_tag and process
              * ou2024 : use OpenUniverse2024 truth tables
              * manual : manually create objects

          provenance : Provenance, UUID, or UUIDifiable str
            The provenance to search.  Must specify either this or
            provenance_tag.  If you specify both, it will verify
            consistency.  Invalid if collection is not 'snpitdb'.

          provenance_tag : str
            The provenance tag to search.  For some provenance tags,
            this goes to a specific subclass (and in that case,
            provenance_id must be None), but for most, it queries the
            Roman SNPIT itnernal database.  Optional if you specify
            provenance.  Invalid if collection is not 'snpitdb'.

          process : str, default None
            The process associated with the provenacne_tag that allows
            the code to determine a unique provenance.  Needed if
            provenance_tag is not None.

          dbclient : SNPITDBClient, default None
            The database web api connection object to use.  If you don't
            specify one, a new one will be made based on what's in your
            configuration.

          diaobject_id : <something>, default None
            The diaobject_id of the object to find.  Only valid if
            collection is 'snpitdb'.

          name : str
            The optional name of the object.  May not be implemented for
            all collections.

          iauname : str
            The TNS/IAU name of the object.  May not be implemented for
            all collections.

          ra: float
            RA in degrees to search.

          dec: float
            Dec in degrees to search.

          radius: float, default 1.0
            Radius in arcseconds to search.  Ignored unless ra and dec are given.

          mjd_peak_min, mjd_peak_max: float
            Only return objects whose mjd_peak is between these limits.
            Specify as MJD.  Will not return any objects with unknown
            mjd_peak.

          mjd_discovery_min, mjd_discovery_max: float
            Only return objects whose mjd_discovery is between these
            limits.  Specify as MJD.  Wil not return any objects with
            unknown mjd_discovery.

          mjd_start_min, mjd_start_max: float

          mjd_end_min, mjd_end_max: float

          order_by: str, default None
            By default, the returned objects are not sorted in any
            particular way.  Put a keyword here to sort by that value.
            Options include 'id', 'provenance_id', 'name', 'iauname',
            'ra', 'dec', 'mjd_discovery', 'mjd_peak', 'mjd_start',
            'mjd_end'.  Not all of these are necessarily useful, and
            some of them may be null for many objects in the database.

          limit : int, default None
            Only return this many objects at most.

          offset : int, default None
            Useful with limit and order_by ; offset the returned value
            by this many entries.  You can make repeated calls to
            find_objects to get subsets of objects by passing the same
            order_by and limit, but different offsets each time, to
            slowly build up a list.

        Returns
        -------
          list of DiaObject

          In reality, it may be a list of objects of a subclass of
          DiaObject, but the calling code should not know or depend on
          that, it should treat them all as just DiaObject objects.
