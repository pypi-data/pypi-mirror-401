        Parameters
        ----------
          psfclass: str
            The name of the class of PSF you want.  Current options are:
            * photutilsImagePSF -- a wrapper (sort of) around photutils.psf.ImagePSF
            * OversampledImagePSF -- a PSF defined by an image which may be oversampled relative to the host image
            * YamlSerialized_OversampledImagePSF -- OversampledImagePSF with a defined save formatr
            * A25ePSF -- YamlSearialized_OversampledImagePSF from Aldoroty et al. 2025
            * ou24PSF_slow -- a PSF from galsim for OpenUniverse 2024
            * ou24PSF -- a PSF from galsim for OpenUniverse 2024

          x, y: float
            The position on the host image that this is the PSF for.
            Usually you want these to have no fractional part (so
            x==floor(x) and y==floor(y)), meaning that you've evaluated
            the PSDF at the center of a pixel.  (If you have PFSs that
            vary significantly on *less than a pixel scale*, you have
            such big problems that you probably shouldn't even be trying
            to do astronomy.)  Sometimes, but rarely. there is a use
            case for these values to have a on-zero fractional part.

            Will default to something sane.

            The exact definition of how this is used currently (sadly)
            depends a bit on the subclass.  See the subclass constructor
            documentation for more details.

          band: str
            The Roman band this is a PSF for.  (I.e. the band of the
            host image.)  Ignored by some subclasses.

          pointing: int, default None
            Roman pointing.  Ignored by many subclasses.

          sca: int, default None
            Probably only relevant for the ou24PSF classes.

          image : snappl.image.Image
            Optional, The image that the psf is for. This is not used all subclasses, but is
            needed for some, currently the ou24 PSFs.

            seed: int, default None
              A random seed to pass to galsim.BaseDeviate for photonOps.

        INDEXING IMAGES
        ---------------

        For discussion of pixel positions below, remember the
        conventions for astronomical arrays.  Consider four things:

        First thing to consider: in python, numpy arrays are 0-indexed.
        That is, if you have a 3-element numpy array named arr, the
        first element of the array is arr[0], the second arr[1], and the
        last arr[2].  Some other languages (e.g. FORTRAN) assume
        1-indexed arrays.  That is, the first element of FORTRAN array A
        is A[1], not A[0].  This matters for us because we are using
        some astronomical formats that have been around since everybody
        spoke Latin and everybody programmed in FORTRAN, so there are
        some legacy conventions left over.  Some libraries (e.g. galsim)
        at least sometimes require you to specify array indexes (such as
        pixel positions) assuming 1-indexed arrays.  Be very careful and
        read lots of documentation!  If we've done it right, everything
        in snappl uses standard python numpy 0-based array indexes, so
        you will hopefully not become confused.  What's more more, the
        astropy.wcs.WCS class also uses the convention of 0-based
        arrays.  (However, be careful, because astropy.wcs has an
        alternate interface that uses the other convention.)

        Another place you will find 1-indexed arrays are in the WCSes
        defined in FITS headers, and in at least some FITS image display
        programs.  If you use ds9 (the standard FITS image display
        program), and hover your pointer over the center of the
        lower-left pixel, you will notice that it tells you it's at
        (1.0,1.0).  This means that if you're reading positions off of
        ds9, you always have to be careful to mentally convert when
        comparing to positions in your code!  Likewise, if you try to
        manually apply the WCS transformation from a FITS header (doing
        the matrix multiplication yourself, rather than relying on a
        snappl or astropy library), you have to make sure you're using
        1-offset pixel coordinates.  Generally, you will not have to
        worry about this; the WCS classes in snappl (just as in astropy)
        will internally take care of all these off-by-1 errors.  As
        stated above, all snappl classes assume 0-based array indexing.

        **If you find yourself manually correcting for 1-offset pixel
        positions in your code, there's a good chance you're doing it
        wrong.  snappl is supposed to take care of all of that.**

        Second thing to consider: following how numpy arrays are
        indexed, the lower-left pixel of an astronomical image is at
        x=0, y=0.  Furthermore, by convention, the *center* of the
        lower-left pixel is at x=0.0, y=0.0.  That means that for a
        512×512 image, the whole array spans (-0.5,-0.5) to
        (511.5,511.5); the lower-left corner of the array, which is the
        lower-left corner of the lower-left pixel, is at (-0.5,-0.5).

        Third thing to consider: because numpy arrays are (by default)
        stored in "row major" format, their indexing is *backwards* from
        what we might expect.  That is, to get to pixel (x,y) on a numpy
        array image, you'd do image[y,x].

        Fourth thing to consider: it follows that a pixel position whose
        fractional part is *exactly* 0.5 is right on the edge between
        two pixels.  For example, the position x=0.5, y=0.5 is the
        corner between the four lower-left-most pixels on the image.  If
        you want to ask for "the closest pixel center" in this case,
        there is an ambiguity, so we have to pick a convention; that
        convention is described below.

        PSF CENTERING FOR get_stamp
        ---------------------------

        If (x0, y0) are not given, the PSF will be centered as best
        possible on the stamp*†.  So, if x ends in 0.8, it will be left
        of center, and if x ends in 0.2, it will be right of center.  If
        the fractional part of x or y is exactly 0.5, there's an
        ambituity as to where on the image you should place the stamp of
        the PSF.  The position of the PSF on the returned stamp will
        always round *down* in this case.  (The pixel on the image that
        corresponds to the center pixel on the stamp is at
        floor(x+0.5),floor(y+0.5), *not* round(x+0.5),round(y+0.5).
        Those two things are different, and round is not consistent.
        round(i.5) will round up if i is odd, but down if i is even.
        This makes it very difficult to understand where your PSF is; by
        using floor(x+0.5), we get consistent results regardless of
        whether the integer part of x is even or odd.)

        For further discusison of centering, see the discusison of the
        (x0, y0) parameters below.

        * "The PSF will be centered as best possible on the stamp": this
          is only true if the PSF itself is intrinsically centered.
          It's possible that some subclasses will have
          non-intrinsically-centered PSFs.  See the documentation on the
          __init__ and get_stamp methods of those subclasses
          (e.g. OversampledImagePSF and photutilsImagePSF) to make sure
          you understand how each subclass handles those cases.  In all
          cases, get_stamp should return stamps that are consistent with
          the description in this docstring.  If a subclass does
          something different, that subclass is broken.

        † "Centered" is obvious when a PSF is perfectly radially
          symmetric: the center of the PSF is its peak, or mode.  If the
          PSF is not radially symmetric, then this becomes potentially
          ambiguous.  The "center" of the PSF really becomes a "fiducial
          point", and cannot be assumed to be the centroid or mode of
          the PSF (and the centroid and mode may well be different in
          this case).  Hopefully it's somewhere close.  If you use
          consistent PSFs, then *relative* positions should be
          realiable.  That is, if you do a PSF fit to an image to find
          positions of stars, and use the PSF positions of those stars
          with a WCS to find ra and dec, this will only work if you used
          the *same* PSFs to find the standard stars you used to solve
          for the WCS!  For most of this discussion, for simplicitly,
          we'll be assuming a radially symmetric PSF so that "peak" and
          "center" and "fiducial point" all mean the same thing.

        Parameters
        ----------
          x, y: floats
            Position on the image of the center of the psf.  If not
            given, defaults to something sensible that was defined when
            the object was constructed.  If you want to do sub-pixel
            shifts, then the fractional part of x will (usually) not be
            0.

          x0, y0: int, default None
            The pixel position on the image corresponding to the center
            pixel of the returned stamp.  If either is None, they
            default to x0=floor(x+0.5) and y0=floor(y+0.5).  (See above
            for why we don't use round().)  The peak* of the PSF on the
            returned stamp will be at (x-x0,y-y0) relative to the center
            pixel of the returned stamp.

               * "peak" assumes the PSF is radially symmetric.  If it's
                 not, by "peak" read "center" or "fiducial point".

            Lots and lots of notes and examples to think through exactly
            what this means:

            Algebra:

            Define xc = floor(x + 0.5), yc = floor(y + 0.5).  This is
              the "closest integral pixel position" on the original
              image to where the PSF is being rendered.  (It's slightly
              different from the pixel position rounded to the nearest
              integer; see above.)

            Define fx = x - xc, fy = y - yc ; both are in the range
              [-0.5, 0.5).

            Define midpix = stamp_size // 2
              (so, for instance midpix=3 for a 7×7 stamp)

            Given how we've defined the x and y parmaeters to this
              function, on the original image, the peak of the PSF is at
              (x, y) = (xc + fx, yc + fy).

            Pixel (midpix, midpix) on the stamp corresponds to (x0, y0)
              on the original image (given the definition of the
              parameters to this function).

            If (x0, y0) = (xc, yc), then the "closest integral pixel
              position" for the peak of the PSF on the stamp is (midpix,
              midpix).

            In general, the "closest integral pixel position" for the
              peak of the PSF on the stamp is (midpix + xc - x0, midpix
              + yc - y0).  (If xc is 5 and x0 is 6, then the center of
              the stamp is to the right of the peak pixel on the stamp,
              so the peak pixel position is less than midpix.)

            The peak position of the PSF on the stamp is
              (midpix + xc - x0 + fx, midpix + yc - y0 + fy)
              (which is the same as (midpix + x - x0, midpix + y - y0)).

            If we define (xrel=0, yrel=0) to be the peak of the PSF, then
              (xrel, yrel) = (0, 0) is (midpix + xc + fx - x0, midpix +
              yc + fy - y0) on the stamp.

            Therefore the center of the stamp, (midpix, midpix), is at
              (xrel, yrel) = (x0 - xc - fx, y0 - yc - fy)

            The center of the lower-left pixel of the stamp, (0, 0), is at
              (xrel, yrel) = (x0 - xc - fx - midpix, y0 - yc -fy - midpix)

            Examples:

            For example: if you call psfobj.get_stamp(111., 113.), and
            if the PSF object as a stamp_size of 5, then you will get
            back an image that looks something like::

                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | |.|o|.| |
                   -----------
                   | |o|O|o| |
                   -----------
                   | |.|o|.| |
                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------

            the PSF is centered on the center pixel of the stamp
            (i.e. 2,2), and that pixel should get placed on pixel
            (x,y)=(111,113) of the image for which you're rendering a
            PSF.  (Suppose you wanted to add this as an injected source
            to the image; in that case, you'd add the returned PSF stamp
            to image[111:116,109:114] (remembering that numpy arrays of
            astronomical images using all the defaults that we use in
            this software are indexed [y,x]).)

            If you want an offset PSF, then you would use a different
            x0, y0.  So, if you call psfobj.get_stamp(111., 113.,
            x0=112, y0=114), you'd get back::

                   -----------
                   | | | | | |

                   |.|o|.| | |

                   |o|O|o| | |

            In this case, center pixel of the returned stamp
            corresponds to pixel (x,y)=(112,114) on the image, but the
            PSF is supposed to be centered at (x,y)=(111,113).  So, the
            PSF is one pixel down and to the left of the center of the
            returned stamp.  The peak of the PSF is at pixel
            (x-x0,y-y0)=(-1,-1) relative to the center of the stamp.
            If you wanted to add this as an injected source on to the
            image, you'd add the PSF stamp to image[112:117,110:116]
            (again, remembering that numpy arrays are indexed [y,x]).

            If you call psfobj.get_stamp(111.5,113.5), then you'd get
            back something like::

                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | |.|.| | |

                   |.|o|o|.| |
                   -----------
                   | |.|.| | |
                   -----------

            Because your pixel position ended in (0.5, 0.5), the PSF is
            centered on the corner of the pixel.  The center of the stamp
            (x,y)=(2,2) corresponds to (floor(111.5+0.5), floor(113.5+0.5))
            on the image, or (x,y)=(112,114).

            If you call psfobj.get_stamp(111.5, 113.5, x0=111, y0=113)
            then you'd get back a stamp::

                   -----------
                   | | |.|.| |
                   -----------
                   | |.|o|o|.|
                   -----------
                   | |.|o|o|.|
                   -----------
                   | | |.|.| |
                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------

            Finally, to belabor the point, a couple of more examples.  If
            you call psfobj.get_stamp(111.25, 113.0), you'd get back a
            stamp with the peak of the psf at (x,y)=(2.25,2.0) on the
            stamp image, with the center pixel corresponding to
            (x,y)=(floor(111.25+0.5), floor(113.+0.5)), or (111,113).
            You would add it to image[111:116,109:114], and the stamp
            would look like::

                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | | |o|.| |

                   | | |o|.| |
                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------

            If you call psfobj.get_stamp(111.25, 113.0, x0=110, y0=114),
            then you'd get a PSF back with the peak of the PSF on the
            stamp at (x,y)=(3.5,1.0), the center pixel corresponding to
            (x,y)=(110,114) on the image, and a stamp that looks like::

                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | | | | | |
                   -----------
                   | | | |o|.|

                   | | | |o|.|
                   -----------

            The peak of the PSF is at (x-x0,y-y0)=(1.25,-1.0) relative
            to the center of the returned stamp.

          flux: float, default 1.
            Ideally, the full flux of the PSF.  If your stamp is big
            enough, and the PSF is centered, then this will be the sum
            of the returned stamp image.  However, if some of the wings
            of the PSF are not captured by the boundaries of the PSF,
            then the sum of the returned stamp image will be less than
            this value.

        which convoles before downsampling.

        See Issue #157.

        Parmaeters
        ----------
          data : 2d numpy array; required
            The oversampled PSF.  data.sum() should be equal to the
            fraction of the PSF flux captured within the boundarys of
            the data array.  (However, see "normalize" below.)  The data
            array must be square, and (unless enforced_odd is false)
            must have an odd side length.

            The peak* of the PSF in the passed data array must be at
            position (peakx,peaky) in pixel coordinates of the passed
            data array.  If you leave those at default (None), then the
            PSF must be perfectly centered on the passed data array.
            (For an odd side-length, which is normal, that means the
            center of the PSF is at the center of the center pixel.)

               * For "peak" vs. "center" vs. "fiducial point", see the
                 caveats in the PSF.get_stamp docstring.

          oversample_factor: integer
            Must be an integer for photutilsImagePSF.  There are this
            many pixels along one axis in the past data array in one
            pixel on the original image that the PSF is for.

          peakx, peaky: float, float
            The position *in oversampled pixel coordinates* on the data
            array where the peak is found.  If these values are not,
            then we assume the peak is at (data.shape[1]//2,
            data.shape[0]//2) (i.e. the center of the center pixel).
            (If you pass an even-length data array, and there is no
            "center pixel", then expect everything to go wrong and the
            world to end.)  See (x, y) below for some examples of
            passing peakx and peaky.

            The safest thing to do is to leave peakx and peaky at their
            defaults of None and make sure that the PSF is centered on
            the passed data array.

          x, y : float, float
            Position on the original source image (i.e. the astronomical
            image for which this object is the PSF) that corresponds to
            the center of the data array.

            WARNING: this is not the same as the x and y parameters
            given to the OversampledImagePSF constructor!  *If* the PSF
            is centered, and x and y have a zero fractional part, then
            the numbers will be the same for both classes.  But, for an
            off-center PSF, the numbers will be different in the two
            cases!  Use intrinsically off-center PSFs at your own peril.
            (Note that you can always *render* stamps with off-centered
            PSFs in get_stamp(), regardless of whether the PSF itself is
            intrinsically centered or not.)  (TODO: figure out why this
            is different and fix that.)

            Usually you want x and y to have no fractional part, you
            want peakx and peaky to be None, and you want the
            oversampled PSF to be centered on the passed data array.

            data must be consistent with these numbers.  Supposed you
            have an 11×11 PSF oversampled by a factor of 3 that is
            centered on the original image at 1023, 511.  In this case,
            the data array should be 33×33 in size (11 times 3).  If the
            PSF is centered on the data array (i.e. on the center of
            pixel (16,16)), then you would pass x=1023, y=511.

            If your PSF is centered on the original image at 1023.5,
            511.5, but you pass x=1023, y=511, that means that the PSF
            needs to be shifted half a pixel to the right and up on the
            (non-oversampled) stamp, or 1.5 pixels right and up on the
            oversampled data array.  The peak of the PSF on the passed
            data array should be at (17.5,17.5), and you must pass
            peakx=17.5 and peaky=17.5

            If your PSF is centered on the original image at 1023.,
            511., but for some reason you pass x=1020, y=512, that means
            that the center of the data array is three (non-oversampled)
            pixels to the left and one (non-oversampled) pixel above the
            peak of the PSF, or 9 oversampled left and 3 oversampled
            above.  In this case, the passed data array should have its
            peak (assuming a symmetric PSF) at the center of pixel
            (13,17), and you must pass peakx=13 and peaky=17.

            CHECK THESE NUMBERS IN THESE EXAMPLES TO VERIFY I DID IT RIGHT.

          enforce_odd: bool, default True
            Scream and yell if data doesn't have odd side-lengths.  You
            probably do not want to set this to False.

          normalize: bool, default False
            If this is True, then the constructor will divide data by
            data.sum() (WARNING: which modifies the passed array!).  Do
            this if you are very confident that, for your purposes,
            close enough to 100% of the PSF flux falls within the
            boundaries of the passed data array.  Better, ensure that
            the sum of the passed data array equals the fraction of the
            PSF flux that falls within its boundaries, and leave
            normalize to False.

        Everything below is implementation notes, which can be ignored
        by people just using the class, but which will be useful for
        people reading the source code.

        photutils has a somewhat different way of thinking about PSF
        positioning on stamps than we do in OversampledImagePSF.  When
        you make an OversampledImagePSF, you give it the x and y on the
        original image where you evaluated the original PSF, and you
        give it an image with the PSF centered on the passed data array
        (or, within 0.5*oversampling_factor pixels of the center of the
        passed data array if the fractional parts of x and/or y are not
        0).

        In contrast, when you make a photutils ImagePSF, you pass it the
        x and y that correspond to the center pixel of the passed array.

        IF x and y have no fraction part, AND the PSF is centered on the
        passed data array, then you would pass the same values of x and
        y when constructing an OversampledImagePSF and a
        photutilsImagePSF.  Hopefully, this is the most common case, so
        confusion will be kept to a minimim.

        However, when that's not true, we have to make sure we interpret
        all the variables right when rendering a photUtilsImagePSF.

        According to the PSF.get_stamp documentation, if x0 and y0 are
        None, then you will always get a stamp with a PSF centered
        within 0.5 pixels of the center of the stamp; it will be offset
        from the center of the stamp by the fractional part of x and y.
        This means we can't just blithely pass the x and y passed to
        get_stamp on to the photutils.ImagePSF evaluator to get the PSF
        stamp, but have to do some arithmetic on it to make sure we'll
        get back what PSF.get_stamp promises.

        If x0 and y0 are passed to get_stamp here, then that is the
        position on the center of the original array that corresponds to
        the center of the returned stamp.  The peak of the PSF on the
        returned stamp needs to be at (x-x0,y-y0).

    This one requires an odd integral oversampling factor.  If your PSF
    is not intrinsically undersampled, you may be able to get away with
    using the faster and more flexible Sampling_OversampledImagePSF.

    get_stamp will tophat-convolve and interpolate the internally stored
    oversampled image to get an source-image-scale sampled PSF using an
    interpolation algorithm that's close to what PSFex uses.

    The internally stored data array is a copy of what is passed.  So,
    if you have an OversampledImagePSF oipsf and do::

      oipsf.oversampled_data = data

    it does not work the way you'd usually expect for arrays.  (That is,
    if you change elements of data thereafter, it will *not* be
    reflected in the data array stored inside OversampledImagePSF.)

    If you have an oversampled image PSF, this is the class that you
    want to use for things like scene modelling.

    WARNING : I don't think using these PSFs with get_stamp() will do
    the right thing with photutils for intrinsically undersampled PSFs
    (e.g. a Gaussian with σ=0.3pix).  See Issue #157.

    def __init__( self, oversample_factor=1., data=None, enforce_odd=True, normalize=False,
                  _parent_class=False, **kwargs ):
        """Make an OversampledImagePSF.

        Parameters
        ----------
          x, y: float
            Required.  Position on the source image where this PSF is
            evaluated.  Most of the time, but not always, you probably
            want x and y to be integer values.  (As in, not integer
            typed, but floats that satisfy x-floor(x)=0.)  These are
            also the defaults that get_stamp will use if x and y are not
            passed to get_stamp.

            If x and/or y have nonzero fractional parts, then the data
            array must be consistent.  First consider non-oversampled
            data.  Suppose you pass a 11×11 array with x=1022.5 and
            y=1023.25.  In this case, the peak of a perfectly symmetric
            PSF image on data would be at (4.5, 5.25).  (Not (5.5,
            5.25)!  If something's at *exactly* .5, always round down
            here regardless of wheter the integer part is even or odd.)
            The center pixel and the one to the right of it should have
            the same brightness, and the pixel just below center should
            be dimmer than the pixel just above center.

            For oversampled psfs, the data array must be properly
            shifted to account for non-integral x and y.  The shift will
            be as in non-oversampled data, only multiplied by the
            oversampling factor.  So, in the same example, if you
            specify a peak of (4.5, 5.25), and you have an oversampling
            factor of 3, you should pass a 33×33 array with the peak of
            the PSF (assuming a symmetric PSF) at (14.5, 16.75).

            Note that for off-centered PSFs (meaning the PSF is not
            centered on the passed data array), the meaning of (x, y) in
            this constructor is *different* from the meaning of (x, y)
            in the photutilsImagePSF constructor.  Use intrinsically
            off-center PSFs at your own peril.  (Note that you can
            always *render* stamps with off-centered PSFs in
            get_stamp(), regardless of whether the PSF itself is
            intrinsically centered or not.)

          data: 2d numpy array or None
            The image data of the oversampled PSF.  If None, then this
            needs, somehow, to be set later.  (Usually that will be
            handled by something in a subclass of OversampledImagePSF;
            if you're setting it manually, you're probably doing
            something wrong.)  data.sum() should be equal to the
            fraction of the PSF flux captured within the boundaries of
            the data array.  (However, see "normalize" below.)  The
            array must be square, and unless enforce_odd is false, the
            length of one side must be an odd number.  Usually the peak
            of the PSF (assuming a symmetric PSF-- if not, replace
            "peak" with "center" or "fiducial point" or however you
            think about it) will be centered on the center pixel fo the
            array.  ALWAYS the peak of the PSF must be centered within
            0.5 *non-oversampled* pixels of the center of the array.
            (That is, if the oversampling factor is 3, the peak of the
            PSF will be centered within 1.5 pixels of the center of the
            passed array.)  See (x,y) below for discussion of
            positioning the PSF on the passed data array.

            A *copy* of the passed data is stored, not the actual passed
            data, so if you change elements of the array you passed
            after making the OversampledImagePSF, it won't be reflected
            inside the OversampledImagePSF.

          oversample_factor: float, default 1, must be odd
            There are this many pixels along one axis in data for one
            pixel in the original image.  Doesn't have to be an integer
            (e.g. if you used PSFex to find the PSF, it usually won't
            be— though if you used PSFex to find the PSF, really we
            should be writing a subclass to handle that!).

          enforce_odd: bool, default True
            Enforce the requirement that the data array have an odd length along each axis.

          normalize: bool, default False
            Ignored if data is not None.  If True, then this constructor
            will make sure that data sums to 1 (modifying the passed
            data array in so doing!).  If you think that the data array
            is big enough that you're effectively capturing 100% of the
            PSF flux, then you should set normalize to True.  If not,
            then you should make sure that the data array you pass sums
            to the fraction of the PSF flux that you're passing, and set
            normalize to False.  Usually you don't want to change this,
            and you want to trust subclases to do the Right Thing.

          _parent_class: bool, default False
            Used internally, do not use.

           a text format, not a binary format, we take the 25% size hit

#         Parameters
#         ----------
#           x, y : float

#             oversampled by this factor.  You probably want this to be an
#             odd integer so that the center of the PSF is not ambiguous.
#             TODO: experiment with different oversample_factors to figure
#             out what the smallest oversampling we can get away with is.

#           oversampled_size: int, default 201
#             The size of a stamp in image pixels on the image for which
#             this is the PSF.  Must be an odd integer.  The stamp you get
#             from get_stamp will have size
#             floor(oversampled_size/oversample_factor), though the size
#             will be increated by one if it would come out to an even
#             number.  (So get_stamp will always return a stamp with an
#             odd side length.)

#             The default of oversampled_size=201 and oversample_factor=5
#             will yield a 41-pixel stamp from get_stamp (since 201/5 =
#             40.2, the floor of which is 40, which is even, so 1 is added
#             to make it an odd 41).

#             out what size of a stamp you'll get when you run
#             get_stamp().)

#           pointing: int
#             Required.  The OpenUniverse2024 pointing.

#           sca: int
#             Required.  The SCA.

#           sed: galsim.SED

#             The OU2024 config file that tells it where to find all of
