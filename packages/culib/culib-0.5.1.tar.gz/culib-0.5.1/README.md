# CULib

Coils Utilities Library (CULib) is a Python package for modeling air-core electromagnet coils and calculating their physical characteristics based on their geometry and wire informations.
It also includes functions for calculating and plotting static magnetic field in 3D or in 1D along their central axis.

CULib allows integration of "real-life" characteristics, such as :
- Coil thickness (because of an external radius and internal radius) and coil length
- Number of turns calculation based on coil geometrical dimensions for a given wire size and shape
- Wire size declaration based on standard AWG sizes, mm, or custom definition (i.e : squared section wire, foil wire... )
- Automatic recalculation of coils parameters in case of modification of geometric params or wire type (useful for wire selection and recalculation of all params based on suppliers capabilities)
- Calculation of voltage and power needed based on current injected and resistance calculation
- Temperature effect on wire resistivity and coil resistance/power
- Estimation of self-inductance and time constant

Supported coil shapes : **Circular** and **Rectangular**

## Examples

```python
import culib as cul

mycoil = cul.CircularCoil(
    axis = 'x_mm',                # Axis of revolution (x axis in mm)
    r_in_mm = 14,                 # Inner coil radius (in mm)
    r_out_mm = 20,                # Outer coil radius (in mm)
    L_mm = 32,                    # Coil length (in mm)
    pos_mm = -8,                  # Position of coil center on axis (in mm) (voluntarily offsetted here)
    cur_A = 3.2,                  # Current applied (in A)
    wire = cul.RoundWire(awg=22), # Wire def. via Wire object, defined with AWG 22 (American Wire Gauge)
)

# Print all coil characteristics
print(mycoil)

# Calc and plot field in 1D
df_field = cul.init_df_field()        
df_field = mycoil.calc_field(df_field)
cul.plot_field(df_field, axis='x_mm', Baxis='Bx_total_mT')
```

## Installation
### Via pip
- Type the following in your **venv**
    ```commandline
    pip install culib
    ```

- Then import in your code
    ```python
    import culib as cul
    ```
- You're ready to use CULib

## Requirements
CULib requires Python >= **3.11** and the packages listed below

_Note_ : packages will be **automatically** installed by using pip as described on the previous step Installation

### Altair and vl-convert
CULib uses **Altair** for plotting charts.
It uses version >= 5.0 for its support for saving chart as .png easily with **vl-convert**.
Using versions below 5.0 will work for displaying and saving as .html, but saving charts as .png might cause issues.
### SciPy
Required for specific calculations on 3D fields from analytic formulas.
### Numpy and Pandas
Standards for science, they are also part of requirements for SciPy and Altair.


## Some specificities
### Units
All parameters reprensenting a physical characteristic contain the unit at the end of its name. Drawback is that it's a bit verbose, but at least it is self-explanatory and will help avoiding stupid mistakes due to conversions.

Examples :
- `x_mm` : position in x axis in mm
- `Bx_total_mT` : Magnetic field flux density for x component in mT (`"total"` meaning it's the sum of every contributors to x component)
- `mycoil.res_ohm` : resistance in Ohm
- `mycoil.temp_degC` : temperature in degrees Celsius
- `mycoil.cur_A` : coil current in Ampere
- `mycoil.wire.d_in_mm` : Wire inner diameter (without insulation) in mm
- `...`

### Auto recalc when changing a coil or wire parameter
At the object creation, attributes that can be deducted from the given parameters are automatically calculated. Equations have been arranged in a way that, from given inputs, outputs can be calculated without conflicts.
You can then access a coil or wire parameter via `print(mycoil.res_ohm)`

Updating one parameter via `mycoil.r_in_mm = 12` will trigger the recalc of all parameters depending on it if `mycoil.is_autorecalc` is `True` (`True` by default).

Example :
```python
>>> mycoil = cul.CircularCoil(
... axis = 'x_mm',              # Axis of revolution (x axis in mm)
... r_in_mm = 14,               # Inner coil radius (in mm)
... r_out_mm = 40,              # Outer coil radius (in mm)
... L_mm = 32,                  # Coil length (in mm)
... pos_mm = 0,                 # Position of coil center on axis (in mm)
... cur_A = 3.2,                # Current applied (in A)
... wire=cul.RoundWire(awg=22), # Wire definition via Wire object, with AWG number 22
... )

>>> print(mycoil.res_ohm)
12.792006481231436

>>> mycoil.r_out_mm = 35 # Decrease the outer radius of your coil (from 40mm to 35mm)
>>> print(mycoil.res_ohm)
9.559168241965974
```
