> **Note:** Version 1.0.0 is the final stable release. No further development is planned.

## Overview
Generate a clean HTML report that summarizes the top-level differences between two JSON files. The report groups keys into Added, Removed, and Changed sections to make the impact of the updates easy to scan.

## Installation

### From PyPI (recommended)
1. Ensure Python 3.9 or newer is available on your system.
2. Install the package:
   ```bash
   pip install json-pretty-diff
   ```
3. Run the CLI to compare two JSON files:
   ```bash
   jpd original.json updated.json -o diff.html
   ```
4. Open `diff.html` in your browser to explore the report.

### From source
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the package in editable mode:
   ```bash
   pip install -e .
   ```

## Usage
Run the command-line tool and point it to the files you want to compare:
```bash
jpd A.json B.json -o diff.html
```

### Options
| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `-o, --output` | Path to the output HTML file. When omitted, HTML is printed to stdout. |
| `--open` | Open the generated HTML report in the default browser (requires `-o`). |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress all output except errors. |
| `--no-style` | Generate HTML without CSS styles (lighter output). |
| `--version` | Show program version and exit. |

### Exit codes
- `0`: no differences were detected (an HTML report is still generated showing "No differences").
- `1`: differences were found and the HTML describes every change.
- `2`: an error occurred (missing file, invalid JSON, or a root element that is not a JSON object) and no HTML report is produced.

## Example
```bash
jpd fixtures/base.json fixtures/update.json -o reports/diff.html
```
The file `diff.html` will contain one section per change category with simple styles that highlight added, removed, or modified keys.

## Limitations
- Only the first-level keys are compared (no recursive diff).
- There are no exclusions, tolerances, or advanced configuration flags.
- Console output never uses ANSI colors.
- There is no CI/CD integration or bundled automated test suite.
