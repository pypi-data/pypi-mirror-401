"""Video player integration with automatic platform detection and fallback.

Provides cross-platform support for launching VLC and mpv media players with automatic
player detection and fallback logic. Handles player discovery via Windows registry,
common paths, and PATH, with command-line argument building based on user configuration.

Features:
    - Automatic player detection (VLC preferred, mpv fallback)
    - Platform-specific discovery (Windows registry, common installation paths, PATH)
    - Configurable playback options (fullscreen, etc.)
    - Single file and playlist support
    - Command-line argument generation from config

Architecture:
    Uses Strategy pattern via PlayerSpec to encapsulate player-specific details.
    Each supported player has a get_command function and options mapping.

Supported Players:
    - VLC and mpv (separate installs)

Platform Support:
    - Windows: Registry lookup → common paths → PATH
    - Unix-like: PATH lookup

Example:
    >>> # Launch a single file
    >>> file = FileResult(Path("movie.mkv"))
    >>> launch_video_player(file)

    >>> # Launch playlist
    >>> files = FileResults([...])
    >>> launch_video_player(files)
