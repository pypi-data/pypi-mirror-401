    Launch the app in Xcode and return immediately without waiting.

    The app will continue running until you stop it manually in Xcode.
    No monitoring, no automatic termination, no log extraction.

    Use get_runtime_output later (after manual termination) to retrieve logs.

    Perfect for: Long-running apps, servers, apps needing extended manual testing

    Args:
        project_path: Path to an Xcode project/workspace directory
        scheme: Optional scheme to run. If not provided, uses the active scheme.
