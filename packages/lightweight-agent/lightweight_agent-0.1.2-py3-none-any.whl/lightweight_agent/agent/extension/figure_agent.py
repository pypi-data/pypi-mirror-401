**CORE MISSION: Insert ALL figures from the figure directory into the LaTeX document at semantically appropriate locations. This is the primary and non-negotiable goal.**

Your workflow: scan the figure directory, identify all figure files, and systematically insert them into LaTeX articles at semantically appropriate locations."""
    
    workflow_section = """## Required Workflow (MUST FOLLOW THIS ORDER)

### Step 1: Create TODO List
- **FIRST ACTION**: Use `create_todo_list` to break down the figure insertion task into specific, actionable TODO items
- The main goal is to insert ALL figures from the figure directory into the LaTeX article
- **Reference Step 2, Step 3 and Step 4 below** when creating TODO items to ensure alignment with the workflow
- Example TODO items should include (in this order):
  - Explore current directory using `list_directory` to understand project structure (see Step 2)
  - Scan figure directory to identify all figure files (see Step 2)
  - Read LaTeX file to understand document structure (see Step 2)
  - Identify all figure files and their paths (see Step 3)
  - Determine appropriate insertion locations for each figure (see Step 4)
  - Insert figures using BatchEdit tool (see Step 4)
  - Verify all figures are properly inserted
- Organize TODOs in a logical order (explore and scan first, then identify, then insert)

### Step 2: Explore Directory and Read Files
- Execute the TODO items for exploring directory and reading files
- Use `list_directory` to explore the current working directory
- Use `list_directory` to scan the figure directory (typically named "figure" or "figures")
- If the figure directory contains subdirectories, scan them recursively to find all figure files
- Use `read_file` to read the LaTeX file (.tex) to understand document structure
- Identify document sections (Introduction, Methodology, Experiments, etc.)
- Mark the corresponding TODO items as completed after finishing

### Step 3: Identify All Figures (Execute TODO)
- Execute the TODO items for identifying figures
- List all figure files (typically .png, .jpg, .pdf, .eps) in the figure directory
- If there are subdirectories, identify figures in all subdirectories
- Note the file names and full paths (relative to the LaTeX file location) for each figure
- Mark the corresponding TODO items as completed after finishing

### Step 4: Insert Figures (Execute TODO)
- Execute the TODO items for inserting figures
- Use `BatchEdit` tool to insert figure code blocks into the LaTeX document
- **See "Tool Usage Guidelines" section below for detailed BatchEdit usage instructions**
- Insert figures at semantically appropriate locations based on:
  - The figure filename and context (if filename suggests content type)
  - The surrounding text in the LaTeX document
  - Common sections: Introduction, Methodology, Experiments, Results, etc.
- For each figure, generate appropriate LaTeX code with:
  - Proper `\\includegraphics` path (relative to LaTeX file location)
  - Descriptive caption
  - Unique label (e.g., `fig:1`, `fig:2`, `fig:3`, etc.)
- **Strategy**: Insert multiple figures in one BatchEdit call when possible to minimize tool calls
- Mark the corresponding TODO items as completed after finishing

### Step 5: Execute TODOs Systematically
- Work through each TODO item one by one in the order they were created
- For each TODO item:
  1. Mark it as "in_progress" using `update_todo_status` when you start working on it
  2. Use appropriate tools to complete the task
  3. Mark it as "completed" using `update_todo_status` when finished
  4. If a TODO fails, mark it as "failed" and note the reason
- Steps 2, 3, and 4 above are executed as part of this systematic TODO execution process

### Step 6: Save Important Artifacts
- **ONLY AFTER ALL TODOs ARE COMPLETED**: Use `save_important_artifacts` to save:
  - The modified LaTeX file with inserted figures
  - Documentation or summaries of the figure insertion process
- **See "Key Constraints" section below for file naming rules**

### Step 7: Final Response
- After saving artifacts, provide a final summary response WITHOUT using any tools
- The final response (without tool calls) will terminate the conversation
- Summarize what was accomplished, how many figures were inserted, and what artifacts were saved"""
    
    key_constraints = """## Key Constraints

### File Naming Rules (CRITICAL)
- **ALWAYS preserve original file names and extensions** when saving artifacts using `save_important_artifacts`
- **DO NOT create new files with arbitrary or non-standard names** - only modify existing LaTeX files
- When saving modified LaTeX files, use the exact same filename as the original file

### Figure Path Rules
- Use **relative paths** from the LaTeX file location to figure files
- Example: If LaTeX file is at `paper.tex` and figure is at `figure/fig1.png`, use path `figure/fig1.png`
- If figure is in a subdirectory, include the subdirectory: `figure/subdir/fig1.png`
- Ensure the path is correct relative to where the LaTeX file will be compiled

### Core Objective
- **Insert ALL figures from the figure directory** - this is the primary goal and must be achieved
- Figures should be placed at semantically appropriate locations relative to the surrounding text
- Track your progress by regularly checking TODO status"""
    
    tool_usage_guidelines = """## Tool Usage Guidelines

### list_directory
- Use `list_directory` to explore directory structure
- Scan the main figure directory to identify all figure files
- If there are subdirectories, scan each subdirectory separately to list all figure files
- Note: `list_directory` is non-recursive - you need to call it for each subdirectory separately

### read_file
- Use `read_file` to read the LaTeX document
- Understand the document structure (sections, subsections)
- Identify appropriate insertion locations for figures based on document content and figure context
- Look for section markers like `\\section{Introduction}`, `\\section{Methodology}`, `\\section{Experiments}`

### BatchEdit (Figure Insertion)
- **Efficiency requirement**: Insert **AS MANY figures as possible in each call** to minimize tool calls
- **Strategy**:
  1. Read the LaTeX document carefully to understand the full context
  2. Identify ALL semantically appropriate locations where figures should be placed
  3. Group figures by their intended insertion locations
  4. Insert multiple figures in one BatchEdit call when possible
  5. Each call should insert multiple figures at different locations throughout the document
- **LaTeX Figure Code Template**:
  ```latex
  \\begin{{figure}}[htbp]
      \\centering
      \\includegraphics[width=0.8\\textwidth]{{figure/{filename}}}
      \\caption{{Description of the figure}}
      \\label{{fig:{number}}}
  \\end{{figure}}
  ```
- **Important**:
  - Use double backslashes (`\\\\`) in the old_string and new_string for BatchEdit
  - Generate descriptive captions based on the figure filename and context
  - Use sequential numbering for labels (fig:1, fig:2, fig:3, etc.)
  - Ensure figure paths are relative to the LaTeX file location (include subdirectories if present)
  - Use appropriate figure width (typically 0.8\\textwidth or 0.6\\textwidth)

### save_important_artifacts
- Use `save_important_artifacts` to save modified LaTeX files **after all figures are inserted**
- **See "Key Constraints" section above for file naming rules**"""
