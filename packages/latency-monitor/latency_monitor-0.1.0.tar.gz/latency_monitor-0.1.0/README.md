# latency-monitor

TCP and UDP latency monitoring tool, with pluggable interface for publishing metrics.

[![Code Quality](https://github.com/mirceaulinic/latency-monitor/actions/workflows/code-quality.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/mirceaulinic/latency-monitor/actions/workflows/code-quality.yml)

## Features

- **TCP Latency Monitoring**: Monitor TCP connection latency one-way and round-trip to specified endpoints.
- **UDP Latency Monitoring**: Measure UDP one-way and round-trip time to target hosts.
- **Pluggable Metrics**: Flexible interface for publishing metrics to various backends
- **Configurable**: Easy configuration for monitoring targets and intervals, 
- **Precision**: Measurements are collected in nanoseconds, and probes can be executed every millisecond. This is ideal
  for capturing micro-bursts, or rapidly changing environments.
- **Stable**: TCP measurements takes place over established connections to reduce the impact of firewalls or other
  intermediary systems. Each probing pair is one flow, maintained while the link is being monitored.
- **Lightweight**: Minimal resource footprint for continuous monitoring, so it can be executed on any operating system 
  (where Python is available).

## Installation

> [!WARNING]
> This package requires Python 3.11 or newer.

Install from PyPI:

```bash
pip install latency-monitor
```
For development installation:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mirceaulinic/latency-monitor.git
cd latency-monitor
uv sync --locked --dev --all-extras
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, the project doesn't have any third-party dependencies. However, depending on the metrics backend you want
to use, you'll have to install the additional package(s). Using ``pip``, you can install the additional requirements by 
running, e.g., ``pip install latency-monitor[datadog]`` if you want to use Datadog as the metrics backend, ``pip install
latency-monitor[zeromq]`` for ZeroMQ and so on. Similarly if you're using ``uv``: ``uv sync --extra datadog`` for 
Datadog, ``uv sync --extra zeromq`` for ZeroMQ, or both ``uv sync --extra datadog --extra zeromq``.

## Configuration

Configuration options can be provided using the ``latency.toml`` file (in TOML format). By default, the program will 
look for it in the current running directory, otherwise you can use the ``-c`` or ``--config-file`` CLI argument to 
provide the absolute path (including the file name).

Example configuration:

```toml
name = "this-host"
max_size = 65535
tcp_port = 17171
udp_port = 17172

[[targets]]
host = "127.0.0.1"
label = "foo"
tags = ["isp:local", "location:laptop"]

[[targets]]
host = "10.0.0.2"
label = "bar"
tcp_port = 1717
udp_port = 1718
size = 65535

[[targets]]
host = "10.0.0.3"
label = "baz"
type = "udp"
interval = 200

[[targets]]
host = "lm.example.com"
timeout = 2

[metrics]
backend = "clickhouse"
host = "click.example.com"
username = "super"
password = "secure"
```

For every target you want to monitor, you can define a configuration block, with the following options:

```toml
[[targets]]
host = "<IP or hostname>"
label = "<label>"
type = "<TCP or UDP>"
rtt = <true or false>
tcp_latency = <true or false>
tcp_port = <TCP port>
udp_port = <UDP port>
size = <packet size in bytes>
interval = <interval in milliseconds>
timeout = <timeout in seconds>
tags = [<a list of metric tags>]
```

Any of these settings are optional, except the IP, of course, and are pretty self-explanatory. Each of these can be 
defined at individual target level, as well as top-level (for all the targets); in other words, target-level options 
inherit the values from top-level when not configured explicitly.

The default values are:

* TCP port: 8000
* UDP port: 8001
* Interval: 1000 (milliseconds)
* Timeout: 1 (second)
* Type: by default both TCP and UDP, unless you only want one
* RTT: whether you want both OWD and RTT measurements, by default ``true``, i.e., RTT values will be provided.
* TCP Latency: whether you want TCP latency measurements, over non-persistent TCP connections. Enabled by default.

While ``label`` is not mandatory, you might want to add it when the ``host`` is an IP address. This value will be set as
metric ``target`` tag (or label) when set, otherwise ``host`` will be used. Of course, when ``host`` is an actual 
hostname instead of an IP address, ``label`` may be superfluous -- but I'd probably advise always using IP addresses 
whenever possible to minimise the impact of other services, e.g., DNS.

The global settings can also be set from the command line, see ``--help``:

```bash
$ latency-monitor --help
usage: latency-monitor [-h] [-c CONFIG_FILE] [-n NAME] [-m {cli,log,zeromq,datadog,pushgateway,clickhouse}] [-l 
{DEBUG,INFO,WARNING,ERROR,CRITICAL}] [-f LOG_FILE] [-r | --rtt | --no-rtt] [-t | --tcp | --no-tcp] [-u | --udp 
| --no-udp] [--tcp-latency | --no-tcp-latency] [--tcp-port TCP_PORT] [--udp-port UDP_PORT] [-s MAX_SIZE] [-x MAX_LOST] [-T TIMEOUT] [-i MSECONDS]

Lightweight TCP and UDP latency monitoring tool

options:

  -c, --config-file CONFIG_FILE
                        Path to configuration file
  -n, --name NAME       The local system name or label. Default: your-machine-name

  Disable RTT and TCP latency probing:
    latency-monitor -c latency.toml --no-tcp-latency --no-rtt

  Rapid UDP probing (every millisecond) only OWD:
    latency-monitor -c latency.toml --no-tcp --no-rtt -i 1
```

## Metrics Publishing

The tool supports pluggable metrics backends. Currently the following are available:

- Datadog
- ZeroMQ
- ClickHouse
- Pushgateway
- Cli
- Log

The last two are probably more important for debugging purposes, than actual production use.

It's very easy to add a new integration, so if you'd like to send your data elsewhere, feel free to open a PR.

## Usage

Once you have the configuration file in place, you can start the daemon (in foreground, won't return the command line 
until you stop via Ctrl-C):

```bash
$ latency-monitor -c /path/to/config.toml
```

> [!WARNING]
> Unlike something like Smokeping, this program MUST run on both sides of a given link. This is necessary particularly
> for OWD (one-way delay) results.

> [!NOTE]
> You will typically need to configure the metrics backend on both sides of a given link, as each will 
> provide different metrics.

There's also a basic API you can use from your programs, should you wish to build on top of this library:

```python
from latency_monitor.api import LatencyMonitor

# Create a monitor instance
monitor = LatencyMonitor()

# Add TCP endpoint
monitor.add_tcp_target("10.0.0.1", port=8000, label="foo")

# Add UDP endpoint
monitor.add_udp_target("10.0.0.2", port=5001, label="bar")

# Start monitoring
monitor.start()

# Pick metrics from the queue yourself. You'll need to invoke this in a separate thread or process than .start()
metric = monitor.metrics_q.get()
```

Naturally, the latency-monitor process must be started up and listening on the target hosts.
