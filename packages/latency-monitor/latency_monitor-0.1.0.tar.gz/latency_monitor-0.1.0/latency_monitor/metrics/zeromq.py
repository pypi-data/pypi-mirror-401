"""
ZeroMQ metrics backend
======================

Puts the metrics on the event bus as soon as they're received.

By default, the ZMQ socket will bind on the local port 8002 (listening to any
interface), but you can change that using the ``address`` and ``port`` options
that you can provide under the ``metrics`` block.

Once you started up the process, you can then subscribe to the ZMQ bus and start
receiving the metrics.
