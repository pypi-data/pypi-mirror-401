# Reference Implementation
Here is a successful implementation to use as reference:

{reference_code}
Available Tech Stacks:

- React (Vite) + Flask + SQLite
  - Modern full-stack app with RESTful backend
  - Features: Authentication, CRUD operations, SQLite database
  - Best for: Applications requiring flexible backend and modern frontend
   - Includes: 
    * Pre-configured API client for React
     * Authentication UI components and hooks
    * Database schema and migrations (Flask/SQLAlchemy)
     * Protected API routes
     * Responsive Tailwind UI components
 


# Application Generation Flow

## Step 1: UI/UX (Frontend Only)
- Modern, responsive UI using React (Vite) and Tailwind CSS
- Loading states and error boundaries
- Toast notifications for user feedback
- Form validation with error messages
- Smooth transitions and animations
- Mobile-first design approach
- No backend integration yet (use mock data if needed)

## Step 2: Authentication Integration
- Implement login, signup, and logout using Flask REST API with JWT cookie authentication
- Secure, real-world authentication flows
- Global auth state management in React
- Route protection for authenticated pages
- Proper error handling and user feedback

## Step 3: Data Persistence (CRUD)
- Implement CRUD operations for main features/entities (e.g., products, employees, orders, etc.)
- Use RESTful Flask API endpoints for all data operations
- State sync between frontend and backend
- UI feedback for all user actions (loading, success, error)
- Error handling and validation

   - package.json (with all required dependencies)
   - tsconfig.json (with proper configuration)
   - tailwind.config.js (for styling)
   - vite.config.ts (for Vite)
   - .env.example
   - requirements.txt (for backend)
   - config.py (Flask config)

2. Core Application Pages:
   - Home/Main listing page
   - Content detail page
   - User interaction pages
   - Action completion pages
   - User profile/account page
   - Authentication pages (login/signup)

3. Essential UI Components:
   - Navigation/Header with user status indicators
   - Footer component
   - Content card/grid components
   - Action summary components
   - Form components for user inputs
   - Loading states and error handling

4. Backend API:
   - RESTful endpoints for all main features/entities
   - JWT cookie authentication
   - SQLAlchemy models and migrations
   - Proper error handling and validation

Please generate all necessary files and ensure:
1. All dependencies are properly versioned
2. Environment variables are documented
3. TypeScript types are complete
4. Error handling is comprehensive
5. Security best practices are followed
6. Code is well-commented
7. File structure is organized
8. Development setup is streamlined 

# UI REQUIREMENTS:
1. Main layout with responsive navigation (React Router)
2. Landing page with key sections:
   - Hero section
   - Features section
   - Pricing section (if relevant)
   - FAQ section
   - Contact/footer section

3. Core application pages and components for the functionality described in the project description
4. A design system with reusable UI components:
   - Button variants
   - Form components (inputs, checkboxes, etc.)
   - Card components
   - Modal/dialog components
   - Loading states
   - Alert/toast notifications

# Backend/API REQUIREMENTS:
- Use Flask Blueprints for modular API structure
- Use SQLAlchemy ORM for models
- Implement JWT cookie authentication
- Use environment variables for secrets/config
- Provide clear error messages and status codes
- Validate all inputs and sanitize data

# Implementation Approach
- Step 1: Build the UI (React + Vite + Tailwind) with mock data
- Step 2: Integrate authentication (login, signup, logout) with Flask backend
- Step 3: Implement CRUD/data persistence for main features/entities

# Response Format
Your response MUST be a valid JSON object with file paths as keys and file contents as values. Do NOT include any explanations or markdown outside the JSON object.

# Success Criteria
- UI is modern, responsive, and production-ready
- Authentication works securely with JWT cookies
- Data persistence is robust and error-tolerant
- Project structure is clean and generic for any business domain (CRM, e-commerce, marketing, etc.)
- All code is well-typed, documented, and maintainable

Ulta Important Guideline :
-  Focus  strictly on implementating code by referencing the given source code . never try to generate too much code from your own
- Never wrote unnecessary code , Goal is to build the product what user mentioned , Not to write too many unnecessary line of code


ULTRA IMPORTANT GUIDELINES -
This is the ui generation phase . Make sure to complete all the frontend related codes in this step.
- Exactly follow provided source code . You mustn't deviate from that . 
- Strily follow the file structure , code within it , everything , It is vital & super important.
