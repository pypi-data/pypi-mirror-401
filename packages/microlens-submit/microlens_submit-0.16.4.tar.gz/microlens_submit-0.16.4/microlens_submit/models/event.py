    """A collection of solutions for a single microlensing event.

    Events act as containers that group one or more :class:`Solution` objects
    under a common ``event_id``. They are created on demand via
    :meth:`Submission.get_event` and are written to disk when the parent
    submission is saved.

    Attributes:
        event_id: Identifier used to reference the event within the project.
        solutions: Mapping of solution IDs to :class:`Solution` instances.
        submission: The parent :class:`Submission` or ``None`` if detached.

    Example:
        >>> from microlens_submit import load
        >>>
        >>> # Load a submission and get/create an event
        >>> submission = load("./my_project")

        >>>
        >>> # Save the submission (includes all events and solutions)
        >>> submission.save()

    Note:
        Events are automatically created when you call submission.get_event()

            alias: Optional human-readable alias for the solution (e.g., "best_fit", "parallax_model").
                When provided, this alias is used as the primary identifier in dossier displays,
