`microlens-submit` provides a robust, version-controlled workflow for managing, validating, and packaging your challenge submission over a long period. It supports both a programmatic Python API and a full-featured Command Line Interface (CLI) for language-agnostic use.

Full documentation is hosted on [Read the Docs](https://microlens-submit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). A comprehensive tutorial notebook is available at `docs/Submission_Tool_Tutorial.ipynb`. Challenge participants who prefer not to use this tool can consult the [Submission Manual](https://microlens-submit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/submission_manual.html) for the manual submission format.

## Key Features

* **Persistent Projects:** Treat your submission as a local project that you can load, edit, and save over weeks or months.
* **Python API & CLI:** Use the tool directly in your Python analysis scripts or via the command line.
* **Solution Management:** Easily add, update, and deactivate degenerate solutions for any event without losing your work history.
* **Active Solution Control:** Quickly list just the active solutions or mark
  all solutions inactive in one call.
* **Automatic Validation:** Aggressive data validation powered by Pydantic ensures your submission is always compliant with the challenge rules.
* **Parameter Validation:** Centralized validation logic checks parameter completeness, types, and physical consistency based on model type and higher-order effects.
* **Rich Documentation:** Notes field supports Markdown formatting for creating detailed, structured documentation and submission dossiers.
* **Environment Capture:** Automatically records your Python dependencies for each specific model fit, ensuring reproducibility.
* **Optional Posterior Storage:** Record the path to posterior samples for any solution.
* **Simple Export:** Packages all your active solutions into a clean, standardized `.zip` archive for final submission.
* **Bulk Import:** Import multiple solutions at once from a CSV file using the `import-solutions` CLI command. Supports column mapping, alias handling, duplicate handling, notes, dry-run, and validation options.

## Installation

The package is available on PyPI:

```bash
pip install microlens-submit
```

### Quickstart Using the Command Line Interface (CLI)

The CLI is the recommended way to interact with your submission project.

You can pass ``--no-color`` to any command if your terminal does not support ANSI colors.

1. Initialize your project:

   ```bash
   microlens-submit init --team-name "Planet Pounders" --tier "experienced" ./my_submission
   cd ./my_submission
   ```

   If you prefer to initialize inside an existing folder, run `microlens-submit init` without a path after `cd` into it.

   To pass validation, you need to have provided a `repo_url` and `hardware_info` to the project and have a git project initialized in your sumission-project directory. On Roman Nexus, you can use `microlens-submit nexus-init` to auto-populate hardware info.

   ```bash
   microlens-submit set-repo-url <url> ./
   microlens-submit set-hardware-info --cpu-details "intel i7 xxx" --ram-gb 32 ./
   # if your git repo lives elsewhere:
   microlens-submit set-git-dir /path/to/repo ./
   ```
2. Add a new solution to an event:

   ```bash
   microlens-submit add-solution ogle-2025-blg-0042 1S2L \
       --param t0=555.5 \
       --param u0=0.1 \
       --param tE=25.0 \
       --notes "This is a great fit!"
   ```

   Model types must be one of `1S1L`, `1S2L`, `2S1L`, `2S2L`, `1S3L`, `2S3L`, or `other`.
   This will create a new solution and print its unique `solution_id`.

   You can run the same command with `--dry-run` first to verify the
   parsed input without saving anything.

3. **Bulk import multiple solutions from a CSV file:**

   ```bash
   microlens-submit import-solutions tests/data/test_import.csv --dry-run
   ```

   See the file `tests/data/test_import.csv` for a comprehensive example covering all features and edge cases.
   You can use this file as a template for your own imports.

4. Deactivate a solution that didn't work out: `microlens-submit deactivate <solution_id>`

5. List all solutions for an event: `microlens-submit list-solutions ogle-2025-blg-0042`

6. Validate solutions and check for issues: `microlens-submit validate-solution <solution_id>`

7. Export your final submission: `microlens-submit export final_submission.zip`

**Note:** When you add a solution, it's automatically validated and any warnings are displayed. Use `--dry-run` to check validation without saving.

### Using the Python API

For those who want to integrate the tool directly into their Python analysis pipeline.

```python
import microlens_submit

# Load or create the project
sub = microlens_submit.load(project_path="./my_challenge_submission")
sub.team_name = "Planet Pounders"
sub.tier = "experienced"

# Get an event and add a solution
evt = sub.get_event("ogle-2025-blg-0042")
params = {"t0": 555.5, "u0": 0.1, "tE": 25.0}
sol = evt.add_solution(model_type="1S2L", parameters=params)

# Record compute info for this specific run
sol.set_compute_info(cpu_hours=15.5)
sol.notes = "This fit was generated from our Python script."

# Save progress to disk
sub.save()

# When ready, export the final package
sub.export("final_submission.zip")
```

## Development

The full development plan can be found in agents.md. Contributions are welcome!

To build and test this project, install the development dependencies using either `pip install -e .[dev]` or `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`. These packages are required to run the test suite and are listed in `requirements-dev.txt`.
After installing the dependencies, run `pre-commit install` to set up the Git hooks for automatic formatting and linting. The development environment needs the following Python libraries.

### Core Dependencies:
* **`typer[all]`**: For building the powerful command-line interface. The `[all]` extra ensures shell completion support is included.
* **`pydantic`**: For aggressive data validation and settings management.

### Testing Dependencies:
* **`pytest`**: The standard framework for testing Python code.
* **`pytest-cov`**: To measure test coverage.

### Packaging & Distribution Dependencies:
* **`build`**: For building the package from the `pyproject.toml` file.
* **`twine`**: For uploading the final package to PyPI.

### Test Data

A comprehensive test CSV file is provided at `tests/data/test_import.csv`. This file is used in the test suite and can be copied or adapted for your own bulk imports or for development/testing purposes.
