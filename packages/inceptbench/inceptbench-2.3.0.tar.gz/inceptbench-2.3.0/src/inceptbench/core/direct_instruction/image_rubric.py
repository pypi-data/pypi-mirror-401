"""
Direct Instruction (DI) Image Quality Rubric Criteria

This module defines the authoritative DI rubric for evaluating educational images.
All image quality evaluators should import these criteria to ensure consistency.

    "label_invention": "Labels/categories/units created that the prompt did not give (e.g., invented axis categories/units)",
    "descriptive_text": "Inappropriate text usage (question text in images, OR missing essential labels in charts/Venn)",

# Special rules by image type
DI_IMAGE_TYPE_RULES = """
• Real-world/counting images: NO descriptive text, labels, or words (like 'apples', 'books', 'total'). Numbers/measurements OK when essential (e.g., "5cm", "90°").
• Charts (bar/line/pie): MUST have series labels, axis labels, legend - these are essential for functionality. NO answer-revealing values.
• Venn diagrams: MUST have group/set labels (e.g., "Math", "Science") but NO numbers in regions; overlap must reflect intersections.
• SVG arithmetic: NO descriptive text (like 'apples', 'total'); numbers only for operators/quantities. Never show the final total.
• Geometric figures: Must show accurate measurements when provided, clear angle markings, proper labeling of vertices.
• Number lines: Must have evenly spaced intervals, clear start/end points, appropriate scale markings.

SCORING & OUTPUT CONTRACT:
- Score each criterion 0–100 and compute the weighted total (0–100).
- Only recommend ACCEPT if total ≥ {DI_IMAGE_ACCEPTANCE_THRESHOLD} AND all DI gates are false.
- You MUST return objects that match the caller's expected schema EXACTLY:
  rankings[].{{rank, image_index, score, strengths[], weaknesses[], changes_required[], recommendation}}
  and top-level {{best_image_index, overall_feedback}}.
- Do NOT include any extra keys (e.g., no 'rubric' object in the output). Instead, summarize key rubric comments under strengths/weaknesses and the overall_feedback.
- For REJECTED images, 'changes_required' MUST be concrete, one-line edits that can be applied directly in a regeneration prompt (e.g., 'Render exactly 24 apples arranged as 4 rows × 6 columns; remove totals.')."""
