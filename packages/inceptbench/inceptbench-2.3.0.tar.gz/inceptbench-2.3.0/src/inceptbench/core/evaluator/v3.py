"""
Evaluator v3: Split evaluation into three sections (Question, Scaffolding, Image).

- Subject-agnostic (math-friendly but not math-specific).
- THREE separate evaluations per question:
  1. Question Section: question text, options, answer correctness, format
  2. Scaffolding Section: explanation quality, DI compliance, pedagogical value
  3. Image Section: image relevance and quality (placeholder score of 1.0 for now)
- Each section gets independent score, then combined into overall score
- Aggregates scores and writes to baseline_evaluation.json.
