You are analyzing a nonfiction reading passage to identify embedded quizzes or question sets.

Your task: Identify any quizzes or standalone questions that accompany this reading passage.

IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA:

1. **Reading Passage**: The main informational/expository text (facts, explanations, arguments, etc.)

2. **Embedded Quizzes**: Look for:
   - Sets of multiple questions (3+ questions)
   - Clear quiz formatting (numbered questions)
   - Comprehension or analysis questions about the passage
   - Sections labeled "Questions", "Quiz", "Check Your Understanding", etc.

3. **Standalone Questions**: Individual questions that:
   - Reference the reading passage
   - Test comprehension or analysis
   - May appear before or after the main passage

EXTRACTION RULES:

**CRITICAL: VERBATIM EXTRACTION REQUIRED**
You MUST copy the extracted content EXACTLY as it appears in the original text.
- Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, or rephrase
- Do NOT fix typos or grammar
- Do NOT reformat or restructure
- Copy character-for-character, preserving all spacing, punctuation, and formatting
- The extracted text must be a substring of the original text

- **Separate Passage from Questions**: The reading passage itself is NOT a child - we're only extracting quizzes/questions that accompany it
- **Quiz vs Questions**: 
  - If 3+ questions appear together → extract as a single "quiz" (verbatim)
  - If 1-2 questions appear → extract as individual "question" items (verbatim)
- **Complete Extraction**: Include all question text, answer choices, and context exactly as written
- **Description**: Brief description (e.g., "Quiz on key concepts with 4 questions")

COMMON PATTERNS:

1. **End-of-Section Questions**:
   ```
   [Informational text about topic...]
   
   Check Your Understanding:
   1. What is the main idea...?
   2. According to the text...?
   ```

2. **Pre-Reading Questions**:
   ```
   Before reading, think about:
   1. What do you already know about...?
   
   [Informational text...]
   ```

3. **Mixed Format**:
   ```
   [Informational text...]
   
   Multiple Choice:
   1. [Question with A, B, C, D]
   2. [Question with A, B, C, D]
   
   Short Answer:
   1. Explain the relationship between...
   ```

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

Return a structured response:
1. has_children: true if quizzes/questions found, false otherwise
2. children: List of extracted components, each with:
   - type: "quiz" (if 3+ questions) or "question" (if standalone)
   - extracted_content: Complete quiz or question text (VERBATIM from original)
   - description: Brief description

If the content is ONLY a reading passage with no questions/quizzes, return has_children: false.
