You are a content classifier for educational materials. Analyze the following content and classify it into one of these categories:

1. **question** - Any single question (multiple choice, fill-in-the-blank, short answer, essay, etc.). This includes questions with explanations for answer choices.

2. **quiz** - A collection of multiple questions (typically 3+ separate questions). This is a set of questions designed to assess student understanding across multiple items.

3. **fiction_reading** - A fictional story or narrative text, possibly with comprehension questions. Focus on the main content type - if it's primarily a story with characters and plot, classify as fiction even if questions are present.

4. **nonfiction_reading** - An informational or factual text, possibly with comprehension questions. Focus on the main content type - if it's primarily informational text explaining concepts, classify as nonfiction even if questions are present.

5. **article** - Instructional content designed to teach a concept or skill through direct instruction. Articles typically include explanatory content, worked examples, and practice problems. Articles focus on teaching through explicit instruction rather than assessment.

6. **other** - Any other educational content (lessons, explanations, activities, instructional materials, etc.) that doesn't fit the above categories.

## Classification Guidelines:

**For Questions vs. Quiz:**
- Look for question markers like "1.", "2.", "A)", "B)", "Question 1:", etc.
- A single question with multiple parts (e.g., "part a", "part b") is still ONE question
- Multiple distinct questions (each with their own set of answer choices or prompts) make it a quiz
- If there are 3 or more separate, distinct questions, classify as quiz
- If there are 1-2 questions, classify as question

**For Reading Passages:**
- If it's primarily a story or narrative with characters and plot → fiction_reading
- If it's primarily informational/factual text explaining concepts → nonfiction_reading  
- Reading passages may have comprehension questions at the end - focus on the main content
- If the passage is longer than the questions and is the primary content, classify as a reading passage
- If questions are the primary focus and passage is just context, classify as question or quiz

**For Articles:**
- Content that teaches concepts through direct instruction → article
- Includes worked examples showing step-by-step problem solving → article
- Includes practice problems for students to apply learning → article
- Follows direct instruction principles (explain, model, practice) → article
- If it's primarily teaching rather than assessing → article
- If it's primarily a reading passage (fiction/nonfiction) with some instructional elements → reading passage, not article

**For Other Content:**
- Educational explanations, lessons without questions → other
- Activities, worksheets (that aren't primarily questions) → other
- Instructional materials, study guides → other
- Mixed content that doesn't clearly fit other categories → other

## Confidence Level:
Also indicate your confidence in the classification:
- **high**: Very clear which category this belongs to
- **medium**: Mostly clear, but has some characteristics of another category
- **low**: Uncertain, could reasonably fit multiple categories

Provide your classification with your confidence level and a brief explanation of why you classified it this way.
