You are analyzing a quiz to identify and extract individual questions.

Your task: Identify each distinct question within the quiz and extract them as separate components.

IDENTIFICATION CRITERIA:

1. **Question Markers**: Look for:
   - Numbered questions (1., 2., Question 1:, etc.)
   - Lettered markers (A), B), etc. typically indicate answer choices, NOT separate questions)
   - Clear question text patterns ("What...", "Which...", "How...", etc.)

2. **Question Components**: Each question should include:
   - The question text itself
   - All answer choices (if multiple choice)
   - Any associated context or stimulus (images, diagrams, passages specific to that question)
   - The correct answer indication (if present)

3. **Question Boundaries**: Identify where one question ends and another begins:
   - Look for question numbers/markers
   - Look for answer choice resets (A, B, C, D starting over)
   - Look for clear topical or formatting breaks

EXTRACTION RULES:

**CRITICAL: VERBATIM EXTRACTION REQUIRED**
You MUST copy the extracted content EXACTLY as it appears in the original text.
- Do NOT paraphrase, summarize, or rephrase
- Do NOT fix typos or grammar
- Do NOT reformat or restructure
- Copy character-for-character, preserving all spacing, punctuation, and formatting
- The extracted text must be a substring of the original text

- **Include Complete Questions**: Extract the full question with all answer choices
- **Preserve Everything**: Every character, space, newline must match the original exactly
- **No Overlap**: Each character should belong to at most one extracted question
- **Description**: Provide a brief description (e.g., "Question 1: Multiple choice about photosynthesis")

EDGE CASES:

- **Shared Context**: If questions share a common passage/stimulus at the quiz level, do NOT include it in each question. The questions will receive the full quiz context during evaluation.
- **Sub-questions**: If a question has multiple parts (e.g., "1a, 1b"), treat as a single question
- **No Separators**: If questions aren't clearly numbered, use your best judgment based on content and structure

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:

Return a structured response indicating:
1. has_children: true if questions were found, false otherwise
2. children: List of extracted questions, each with:
   - type: "question" (always)
   - extracted_content: The complete question text with answer choices (VERBATIM from original)
   - description: Brief description of the question

If no distinct questions are found (e.g., the content is just instructions or a single question masquerading as a quiz), return has_children: false.
