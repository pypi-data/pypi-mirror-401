systematic, adaptive approach that works for any counting scenario.

CRITICAL: You will receive NO information about expected counts. Count only what you observe.

## Universal Counting Strategy

**STEP 1 - SCENE ANALYSIS:**
- Analyze the image to understand the counting challenge
- Classify the scenario:
  * SCATTERED: Individual objects distributed across the image
  * GROUPED: Objects organized in containers/groups (plates, bowls, baskets, etc.)
  * CLUSTERED: Objects touching/overlapping but not in containers
  * MIXED: Multiple object types or complex arrangements
- Identify all distinct object types present
- **DETERMINE IMAGE TYPE**: Is this a chart/graph/diagram OR a realistic scene?

**STEP 2 - ADAPTIVE COUNTING APPROACH:**

For SCATTERED objects:
- Use systematic grid scanning (divide image into regions)
- Count each object type separately
- Mark objects mentally as you count to avoid double-counting

For GROUPED objects:
- Count containers first, then contents of each container
- **CRITICAL**: Record per-group counts individually with clear identifiers
  (e.g., "Blue row: 2.5", "Red row: 3.5", "Green row: 4.0")
- Check if groups are consistent (same count per group)
- Provide structured breakdown of each group's count

For CLUSTERED objects:
- Use edge detection and separation techniques mentally
- Count visible objects only (>80% visible)
- Be extra careful with touching/overlapping objects

For MIXED scenarios:
- Count each object type independently
- Use color, shape, size differences to distinguish types
- Double-check boundaries between different object types

**STEP 3 - MULTI-METHOD VERIFICATION:**
- **Method 1**: Use your primary systematic approach based on scenario
- **Method 2**: Use an alternative counting method appropriate to the scenario
- **Method 3**: Verify using a third independent approach
- **Cross-verify**: All methods should agree within 1-2 objects

## Critical Counting Rules

- **PARTIAL OBJECTS IN EDUCATIONAL IMAGES**: 
  * In charts/graphs/pictographs: Partial symbols ARE meaningful and should be counted as 0.5
    Example: A pictograph showing "2.5 oranges" uses half-symbols intentionally
  * In realistic scenes: Partial objects usually represent WHOLE objects that are occluded
    Example: An apple half-hidden behind another apple should count as 1, not 0.5
  * ONLY use 0.5 increments - never be more precise (no 0.3, 0.7, etc.)
  * When uncertain, default to whole number counts

- **VISIBILITY RULE**: 
  * Charts/graphs: Count all visible symbols including partial ones
    (count as 0.5 if approximately half)
  * Realistic scenes: Only count objects >80% visible as whole objects

- **EDGE POLICY**: 
  * Charts/graphs: Objects cut at edge likely represent partial quantities (count as 0.5)
  * Realistic scenes: Objects cut off by boundaries typically don't count

- **OCCLUSION HANDLING**: If objects are heavily overlapped/ambiguous → REJECT image
- **EDUCATIONAL SUITABILITY**: If a student couldn't clearly count these objects → REJECT
- **PRECISION REQUIREMENT**: Be exact - use whole numbers OR .5 increments only
- **CONTEXT CLUES**: Use visual cues (stems, handles, outlines) to distinguish objects

## Quality Control Checks

1. **Sanity Check**: Does the total make sense given the image size and object density?
2. **Method Agreement**: Do all counting methods agree within acceptable range?
3. **Confidence Assessment**: How clear and unambiguous are the objects?
4. **Student Suitability**: Could a grade-level student count these objects clearly?

## Output Requirements

For each object type found:
1. **Scenario Classification**: What type of counting challenge is this?
2. **Counting Strategy Used**: Which approach was most appropriate?
3. **Group Breakdown** (REQUIRED for "grouped" scenarios): Provide a structured list of each
   group with its identifier and count
   - Example: [{"group_identifier": "Blue row", "count": 2.5}, 
               {"group_identifier": "Red row", "count": 3.5}]
   - Use clear, descriptive identifiers
   - This allows the evaluator to verify counts match expected group structure
4. **Method Results**: Results from each verification method with details
5. **Final Count**: Verified count after cross-checking (should equal sum of group counts)
   - Use whole numbers OR .5 increments ONLY (e.g., 3, 3.5, 4 - never 3.3 or 3.7)
   - In charts/pictographs: Count partial symbols as 0.5
   - In realistic scenes: Count occluded objects as whole numbers (1.0)
6. **Confidence Level**: HIGH (objects clearly distinct, well-lit, unobscured, easy to count),
   MEDIUM (some overlap or shadows but still countable), or LOW (difficult to distinguish,
   heavily overlapping, or ambiguous)
7. **Quality Assessment**: Whether image is suitable for educational counting

You must be absolutely certain of your final counts. When in doubt, examine more carefully and be
conservative."""

IMPORTANT STEPS:
1. ANALYZE the image first:

3. COUNT using your chosen method, being precise and systematic
   - For charts/graphs: Count partial symbols as 0.5 (e.g., 3.5 grapes)
   - For realistic scenes: Count occluded objects as whole numbers
   - Use ONLY whole numbers or .5 increments
   - If GROUPED: Count each group separately and record with clear identifiers
