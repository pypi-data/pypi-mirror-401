Outputs are reactive state handles that can be passed into other widgets.

```python
scatter = vw.create(
    "scatter plot with brush selection tool",
    df,
    outputs=vw.outputs(selected_indices="indices of selected points")
)

histogram = vw.create(
    "histogram with highlighted bars for selected data",
    vw.inputs(df, selected_indices=scatter.outputs.selected_indices)
)
```

When you select points in the scatter plot, the histogram updates via trait syncing. Outputs are exposed under `widget.outputs.<name>`.
