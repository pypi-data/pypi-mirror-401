    Abstract base class for handling artifacts within a FeatureSet.

    Artifacts are data generated by a feature group and can be used by other feature groups.
    This is necessary for scenarios such as embeddings, where the output of one feature group
    serves as an input for another, enabling complex data transformations and feature engineering
    workflows.

    This class provides mechanisms to load and save artifacts with validation and customization points.
    It ensures that artifacts are correctly managed, validated, and can be customized as per the
    specific requirements of different feature groups.
