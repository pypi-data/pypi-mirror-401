        Statement of Purpose
        
        The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
        exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
        and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
        authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").
        
        Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights to a Work for
        the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural and
        scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
        of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
        works, reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form whatsoever
        and for any purposes, including without limitation commercial purposes.
        These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
        culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
        works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in
        part through the use and efforts of others.
        
        For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
        expectation of additional consideration or compensation, the person
        associating CC0 with a Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she
        is an owner of Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily
        elects to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work under its
        terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the
        Work and the meaning and intended legal effect of CC0 on those rights.
        
        1. Copyright and Related Rights. A Work made available under CC0 may be
        protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and
        Related Rights"). Copyright and Related Rights include, but are not
        limited to, the following:
        
          i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
             communicate, and translate a Work;
         ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or performer(s);
        iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or
             likeness depicted in a Work;
         iv. rights protecting against unfair competition in regards to a Work,
             subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a), below;
          v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data
             in a Work;
         vi. database rights (such as those arising under Directive 96/9/EC of the
             European Parliament and of the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal
             protection of databases, and under any national implementation
             thereof, including any amended or successor version of such
             directive); and
        vii. other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights throughout the
             world based on applicable law or treaty, and any national
             implementations thereof.
        
        2. Waiver. To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention
        of, applicable law, Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently,
        irrevocably and unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
        Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims and causes
        of action, whether now known or unknown (including existing as well as
        future claims and causes of action), in the Work (i) in all territories
        worldwide, (ii) for the maximum duration provided by applicable law or
        treaty (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or future
        medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever,
        including without limitation commercial, advertising or promotional
        purposes (the "Waiver"). Affirmer makes the Waiver for the benefit of each
        member of the public at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
        successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be subject to
        revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination, or any other legal or
        equitable action to disrupt the quiet enjoyment of the Work by the public
        as contemplated by Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
        
        3. Public License Fallback. Should any part of the Waiver for any reason
        be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, then the
        Waiver shall be preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into
        account Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
        extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each affected
        person a royalty-free, non transferable, non sublicensable, non exclusive,
        irrevocable and unconditional license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and
        Related Rights in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
        maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty (including future
        time extensions), (iii) in any current or future medium and for any number
        of copies, and (iv) for any purpose whatsoever, including without
        limitation commercial, advertising or promotional purposes (the
        "License"). The License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
        applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the License for any
        reason be judged legally invalid or ineffective under applicable law, such
        partial invalidity or ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder
        of the License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or she
        will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining Copyright and Related
        Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any associated claims and causes of
        action with respect to the Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's
        express Statement of Purpose.
        
        4. Limitations and Disclaimers.
        
         a. No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are waived, abandoned,
            surrendered, licensed or otherwise affected by this document.
         b. Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no representations or
            warranties of any kind concerning the Work, express, implied,
            statutory or otherwise, including without limitation warranties of
            title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non
            infringement, or the absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
            the present or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
            the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.
         c. Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of other persons
            that may apply to the Work or any use thereof, including without
            limitation any person's Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.
            Further, Affirmer disclaims responsibility for obtaining any necessary
            consents, permissions or other rights required for any use of the
            Work.
         d. Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative Commons is not a
            party to this document and has no duty or obligation with respect to
            this CC0 or use of the Work.

## Installation

To install the package, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install coaiapy
```

## Usage

### CLI Tool

CoAiAPy provides a CLI tool for audio transcription, summarization, and stashing to Redis.

#### Help

To see the available commands and options, use the `--help` flag:

```bash
coaia --help
```

#### Setup

**Quick Start with Environment Variables**:

CoAiAPy supports multiple configuration methods. The easiest way is using environment variables or a `.env` file:

```bash
# Upstash Redis (Recommended)
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-instance.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token

# OpenAI API
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key

# AWS (for Polly text-to-speech)
AWS_KEY_ID=your_aws_key_id
AWS_SECRET_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
```

**Using a .env file** (recommended for projects):

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in your project directory
2. Fill in your credentials
3. CoAiAPy will automatically load these values

**Alternative Redis Configuration**:

If you're using a traditional Redis instance instead of Upstash:

```bash
REDIS_HOST=localhost
REDIS_PORT=6379
REDIS_PASSWORD=your_password
REDIS_SSL=false
```

**Configuration Priority**: 
1. System environment variables (highest)
2. `.env` file in current directory
3. `~/.coaia.json` configuration file
4. Default values (lowest)

For detailed configuration instructions, see [REDIS_CONFIGURATION.md](REDIS_CONFIGURATION.md).
#### Transcribe Audio

To transcribe an audio file to text:

```bash
coaia transcribe <file_path>
```

Example:

```bash
coaia transcribe path/to/audio/file.mp3
```

#### Summarize Text

To summarize a text:

```bash
coaia summarize <text>
```

Example:

```bash
coaia summarize "This is a long text that needs to be summarized."
```

To summarize text from a file:

```bash
coaia summarize --f <file_path>
```

Example:

```bash
coaia summarize --f path/to/text/file.txt
```

#### Stash Key-Value Pair to Redis

To stash a key-value pair to Redis:

```bash
coaia tash <key> <value>
```

Example:

```bash
coaia tash my_key "This is the value to stash."
```

To stash a key-value pair from a file:

```bash
coaia tash <key> --f <file_path>
```

Example:

```bash
coaia tash my_key --f path/to/value/file.txt
```

#### Fetch Value from Redis

To fetch a value from Redis by key:

```bash
coaia fetch <key>
```

Example:

```bash
coaia fetch my_key
```

To fetch a value from Redis and save it to a file:

```bash
coaia fetch <key> --output <file_path>
```

Example:

```bash
coaia fetch my_key --output path/to/output/file.txt
```

#### Process Custom Tags

Enable custom quick addons for assistants or bots using process tags. To add a new process tag to `coaia.json`, include entries like:
```
	"dictkore_temperature":0.2,
	"dictkore_instruction": "You do : Receive a dictated text that requires correction and clarification.\n\n# Corrections\n\n- In the dictated text, spoken corrections are made. You make them and remove the text related to that to keep the essence of what is discussed.\n\n# Output\n\n- You keep all the essence of the text (same length).\n- You keep the same style.\n- You ensure annotated dictation errors in the text are fixed.",
```
```bash
coaia p dictkore "my text to correct"
```

## 🚀 Pipeline Templates & Environment Management

### Revolutionary Workflow Automation

CoAiAPy transforms complex AI pipeline creation from 30+ minute manual processes into 30-second automated workflows using templates and persistent environment management.

### Pipeline Templates

#### Built-in Templates (5 Available)

1. **simple-trace**: Basic monitoring with single observation
2. **data-pipeline**: Multi-step data processing workflow with validation
3. **llm-chain**: LLM interaction pipeline with input/output tracking
4. **parallel-processing**: Concurrent task execution with synchronization
5. **error-handling**: Robust error management with retry mechanisms

#### Template Commands

```bash
# List all available templates
coaia pipeline list
coaia pipeline list --path --json

# Inspect template details and variables
coaia pipeline show simple-trace
coaia pipeline show data-pipeline --preview

# Create pipeline from template (automatic trace/observation creation)
coaia pipeline create simple-trace --var trace_name="My Process" --var user_id="john"
coaia pipeline create data-pipeline --var pipeline_name="ETL Process" --export-env

# Create new custom template
coaia pipeline init my-template
coaia pipeline init custom-workflow --from data-pipeline --location project
```

#### Template Features

- **Variable Substitution**: Jinja2-powered with validation and built-in functions
- **Conditional Steps**: Include/exclude steps based on variable conditions
- **Parent-Child Relationships**: Automatic SPAN observation hierarchies
- **Template Hierarchy**: Project → Global → Built-in discovery system
- **Auto-Generation**: Trace IDs, observation IDs, timestamps generated automatically

### Environment Management

#### Persistent Cross-Session Variables

Environment files (`.coaia-env`) provide persistent variable storage across shell sessions:

```bash
# Initialize environment with defaults
coaia environment init                    # Creates .coaia-env (project)
coaia environment init --global          # Creates ~/.coaia/global.env
coaia environment init --name dev        # Creates .coaia-env.dev

# Manage variables
coaia environment set COAIA_USER_ID "john"     # Persist to file
coaia environment set DEBUG_MODE "true" --temp # Session only
coaia environment get COAIA_TRACE_ID           # Get variable value
coaia environment unset OLD_VARIABLE           # Remove variable

# List and inspect environments  
coaia environment list                    # Show all environments
coaia environment list --name dev        # Show specific environment
coaia environment list --json           # JSON output

# Shell integration
eval $(coaia environment source --export)     # Load variables into shell
coaia environment save --name "my-context"    # Save current state

# Load environment for any command using --env flag
coaia --env /path/to/.env.myproject fuse traces list
coaia --env .coaia-env.dev pipeline create llm-chain --var model="gpt-4"
```

> **Note**: The `environment` command can also be invoked using the shorter alias `env` for convenience:
> `coaia env list` is equivalent to `coaia environment list`

#### Advanced Workflow Examples

**One-Command Pipeline Creation:**
```bash
# Before: Complex manual setup (30+ minutes)
export TRACE_ID=$(uuidgen)
export SESSION_ID=$(uuidgen) 
coaia fuse traces create $TRACE_ID -u john -s $SESSION_ID
export OBS_ID=$(uuidgen)
coaia fuse traces add-observation $OBS_ID $TRACE_ID -ts -n "Step 1"
# ... repeat for each step ...

# After: One-command automation (< 30 seconds)
coaia pipeline create data-pipeline \
  --var user_id="john" \
  --var pipeline_name="ETL Process" \
  --export-env

# Automatic: trace creation, observation hierarchy, environment setup
```

**Cross-Session Workflow Persistence:**
```bash
# Session 1: Start pipeline and persist state
coaia pipeline create llm-chain --var model="gpt-4" --export-env
coaia environment save --name "llm-session"

# Session 2: Resume from saved state (hours/days later)
eval $(coaia environment source --name llm-session --export)
coaia fuse traces add-observation $COAIA_TRACE_ID -n "Continued processing"
```

**Custom Template Creation:**
```bash
# Create project-specific template
coaia pipeline init company-etl --from data-pipeline --location project
# Edit ./.coaia/templates/company-etl.json with custom variables and steps

# Use custom template
coaia pipeline create company-etl --var data_source="production_db"
```

#### Environment File Formats

**JSON Format** (`.coaia-env`):
```json
{
  "COAIA_TRACE_ID": "uuid-here",
  "COAIA_USER_ID": "john",
  "CUSTOM_VARIABLE": "value"
}
```

**.env Format** (`.coaia-env`):
```bash
COAIA_TRACE_ID="uuid-here"
COAIA_USER_ID="john"
CUSTOM_VARIABLE="value"
```

### Building and Publishing

Use the provided `Makefile` to build and distribute the package. Typical tasks:

```bash
make build        # create sdist and wheel
make dist         # alias for make build
make upload-test  # upload the distribution to Test PyPI
make test-release # bump patch version, clean, build, and upload to Test PyPI
```

Both upload tasks use:
`twine upload --repository testpypi dist/*`
`make test-release` automatically sources `$HOME/.env` so `TWINE_USERNAME` and `TWINE_PASSWORD` are available.
If you need the variables in your shell, run:
```bash
export $(grep -v '^#' $HOME/.env | xargs)
```
It also bumps the patch version using `bump.py` before uploading.


## Langfuse Integration (`fuse`)

CoAiAPy integrates with Langfuse to manage prompts, datasets, and traces.

### Listing Prompts

To see a formatted table of all available prompts:
```bash
coaia fuse prompts list
```

### Getting a Specific Prompt

Retrieve a prompt by name. By default, it fetches the version with the `latest` label.
```bash
coaia fuse prompts get <prompt_name>
```

**Options:**
- `--label <label>`: Fetch the version with a specific label (e.g., `dev`, `staging`).
- `--prod`: A convenient shortcut for `--label production`.
- `--json`: Output the raw JSON response.
- `-c`, `--content-only`: Output only the raw prompt content, ideal for scripting.
- `-e`, `--escaped`: Output the prompt content as a single, JSON-escaped line. This is useful for embedding the content in other scripts or commands. Using `-e` implies `-c`.

**Examples:**
```bash
# Get the latest version of a prompt
coaia fuse prompts get MyPrompt

# Get the production version of a prompt
coaia fuse prompts get MyPrompt --prod

# Get only the content of a prompt
coaia fuse prompts get MyPrompt -c

# Get the content as an escaped, single line
coaia fuse prompts get MyPrompt -e
```

### Managing Datasets

#### Listing Datasets
To see a formatted table of all available datasets:
```bash
coaia fuse datasets list
```

#### Getting a Specific Dataset and its Items
Retrieve a dataset's metadata and all of its items in a formatted display.
```bash
coaia fuse datasets get <dataset_name>
```

**Options:**
- `--json`: Output the raw JSON for the dataset and its items.
- `-oft`, `--openai-ft`: Format the dataset for OpenAI fine-tuning (JSONL).
- `-gft`, `--gemini-ft`: Format the dataset for Gemini fine-tuning (JSONL).
- `--system-instruction "<text>"`: Customize the system instruction for fine-tuning formats. The default is "You are a helpful assistant".

**Examples:**
```bash
# Get a formatted view of a dataset and its items
coaia fuse datasets get MyDataset

# Get the raw JSON for a dataset
coaia fuse datasets get MyDataset --json

# Export a dataset for OpenAI fine-tuning
coaia fuse datasets get MyDataset -oft > training_data.jsonl

# Export for Gemini with a custom system instruction
coaia fuse datasets get MyDataset -gft --system-instruction "You are a creative writing assistant."
```

#### Creating a New Dataset
You can create a new, empty dataset directly from the CLI.
```bash
coaia fuse datasets create <new_dataset_name>
```

#### Adding Items to a Dataset
You can add new items (with an input and an optional expected output) to an existing dataset.
```bash
coaia fuse dataset-items create <dataset_name> --input "User question or prompt." --expected "Ideal model response."
```

### Traces & Observations - Enhanced AI Pipeline Support

CoAiAPy provides comprehensive support for Langfuse traces and observations with enhanced pipeline integration.

#### Creating Traces

Create a new trace with session, user metadata, and optional environment variable export:
```bash
coaia fuse traces create <trace_id> -s <session_id> -u <user_id> -n "Trace Name"
```

**Pipeline Integration Example:**
```bash
# Create trace and export environment variables for pipeline use
eval $(coaia fuse traces create $(uuidgen) -s $(uuidgen) -u pipeline-user -n "AI Workflow" --export-env)
echo "Created trace: $COAIA_TRACE_ID"
```

#### Adding Observations

Add single observations to traces with auto-generated IDs and enhanced CLI options:

**Basic Usage:**
```bash
# Observation ID is auto-generated if not provided
coaia fuse traces add-observation <trace_id> -n "Processing Step" -i '{"input":"data"}' -o '{"result":"output"}'

# With explicit observation ID
coaia fuse traces add-observation <trace_id> <observation_id> -n "Custom Step"
```

**Observation Types with Shortcuts:**
```bash
# EVENT (default) - discrete events
coaia fuse traces add-observation <trace_id> -te -n "Data Loaded"

# SPAN - operations with duration  
coaia fuse traces add-observation <trace_id> -ts -n "Main Processing"

# GENERATION - AI model calls
coaia fuse traces add-observation <trace_id> -tg -n "LLM Response" --model "gpt-4"
```

**Parent-Child Relationships:**
```bash
# Create parent SPAN
eval $(coaia fuse traces add-observation $COAIA_TRACE_ID -ts -n "Main Workflow" --export-env)
parent_span=$COAIA_LAST_OBSERVATION_ID

# Add child observations under the SPAN
coaia fuse traces add-observation $COAIA_TRACE_ID -n "Step 1" --parent $parent_span
coaia fuse traces add-observation $COAIA_TRACE_ID -n "Step 2" --parent $parent_span
```

**Pipeline Workflow Example:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Complete AI pipeline with automatic ID propagation

# Step 1: Create trace and export environment
eval $(coaia fuse traces create $(uuidgen) -s $(uuidgen) -u ai-pipeline --export-env)

# Step 2: Create main SPAN observation
eval $(coaia fuse traces add-observation $COAIA_TRACE_ID -ts -n "AI Processing Pipeline" --export-env)
main_span=$COAIA_LAST_OBSERVATION_ID

# Step 3: Add processing steps under the main SPAN
eval $(coaia fuse traces add-observation $COAIA_TRACE_ID -n "Data Loading" --parent $main_span --export-env)
eval $(coaia fuse traces add-observation $COAIA_TRACE_ID -tg -n "Model Inference" --parent $main_span --model "gpt-4" --export-env)
eval $(coaia fuse traces add-observation $COAIA_TRACE_ID -n "Results Processing" --parent $main_span --export-env)

echo "Pipeline complete! Trace: $COAIA_TRACE_ID"
```

#### Batch Observations

Add multiple observations from JSON or YAML files:
```bash
# From file
coaia fuse traces add-observations <trace_id> -f observations.json

# From stdin with YAML format
cat observations.yaml | coaia fuse traces add-observations <trace_id> --format yaml

# Dry run to preview what would be created
coaia fuse traces add-observations <trace_id> -f observations.json --dry-run
```

**Example JSON format for batch observations:**
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Data Processing",
    "type": "SPAN",
    "input": {"dataset": "user_data.csv"},
    "output": {"processed_rows": 1000}
  },
  {
    "name": "Model Training", 
    "type": "GENERATION",
    "parent_observation_id": "previous-observation-id",
    "model": "gpt-4",
    "usage": {"tokens": 150, "cost": 0.003}
  }
]
```

#### Environment Variables for Pipelines

CoAiAPy exports standard environment variables for seamless pipeline integration:

- `COAIA_TRACE_ID`: Current trace identifier
- `COAIA_SESSION_ID`: Current session identifier  
- `COAIA_USER_ID`: Current user identifier
- `COAIA_LAST_OBSERVATION_ID`: Most recently created observation ID
- `COAIA_PARENT_OBSERVATION_ID`: Parent observation ID (when using --parent)

**Usage Pattern:**
```bash
# Commands with --export-env output only shell export statements (no JSON)
