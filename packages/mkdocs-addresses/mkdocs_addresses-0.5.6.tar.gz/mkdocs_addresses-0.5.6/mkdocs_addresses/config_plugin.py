    Exploring the resulting html content of a page to gather and cross-check all the identifiers

    the serve operations when the number of documents or their size become increase.

    To mitigate the issue, the plugin utilizes a cache (activated by default).

    When activated, only the recently modified markdown files will be re-evaluated during the next
    serve operation. This drastically reduces the serving time without changing the underlying
    logic of the plugin.

    Note that when mkdocs starts, all pages must be explored at least once, so the first serve
    operation can be very slow on big documentations.

    If this option is defined:

    fail_fast: bool = False
    """
    This option determines whether the errors raised by the plugin will completely stop the
    serving process or will only provide information in the console without causing interruptions.

    During the documentation creation process, it can be advantageous to set this option to false.
    This way, there is no need to restart the server each time the plugin finds an incorrect link.
    Instead, you can continue working and address errors one by one.

    If `fail_fast` is set to false, a summary of all the wrong addresses found will be displayed
    once all the pages have been checked. This is especially helpful when there are a lot of
    errors and the content of the console becomes overwhelming.

    The summary is formatted like this:

    ```
    WARNING -  mkdocs-addresses: running with fail_fast=false...
               Summary of the exceptions raised while managing the references in the pages:
                   {error name}:    {error count}
                     {file location}     {identifier triggering the error}
    ```

    In these summaries, if the same identifier triggers several times the same error on the same
    page, it is counted only once.

    Note that some errors will appear separately from these summaries. Specifically,
    [`OutDatedReferenceError`](--mkdocs_addresses_exceptions_OutdatedReferenceError), which is
    checked at a different point during the validation process.

    In essence:

    * `ignore_auto_headers=true` (recommended):

        The same titles can be used in different locations, but headers must be explicitly marked

        ```markdown
        ## Content

        ## Content

        ### Hall of fame! {: #hall-of-fame }
        This example would result in a false negative and be ignored,
        because the id would be considered identical to the content.
        ```


    * `ignore_auto_headers=false`:

        In this case, all headers must be unique or have an id attribute (or
        [configured as ignored](--auto-headers-false)), otherwise a

    During anchors validations, when `strict_anchor_check` is set to true, an anchor has to match
    an identifier to be considered valid.
    If set to false, the plugin will no longer raise errors regarding unknown anchors. Instead,
    it will display a warning in the console.

    !!!note "Rationale"
        Users are encouraged to use the plugin's identifiers but:

        1. They could use bare anchors to write links within the current document.
        1. They could have added the plugin to an old project which utilizes the "old-fashion"
           addresses (`../a/b/c.md`).

        By essence, neither of these situations is problematic but, when
        [`ignore_auto_headers`][mkdocs_addresses.config_plugin.PluginOptions.ignore_auto_headers]
        is set to true (which is the default value...), the plugin cannot know anymore about the
        automatic headers and will assume the anchor is wrong if it doesn't match any of its
        registered identifiers.

        This behavior can be turned off by setting `strict_anchor_check` to false. However, keep
        in mind this is discouraged because doing so significantly reduces the level of
        assurance the plugin can provide regarding the correctness of all the addresses within
        the documentation.

        In summary:

        * Setting `strict_anchor_check` to false is not recommended, as it diminishes the
          reliability of the plugin's verifications.
        * But it might be useful to facilitate the integration of the plugin into older projects.
