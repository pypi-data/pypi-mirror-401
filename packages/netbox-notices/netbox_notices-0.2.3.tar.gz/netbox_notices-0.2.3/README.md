# NetBox Notices

**Repository:** [github.com/jsenecal/netbox-notices](https://github.com/jsenecal/netbox-notices)
**Documentation:** [jsenecal.github.io/netbox-notices](https://jsenecal.github.io/netbox-notices)
**PyPI:** [pypi.org/project/netbox-notices](https://pypi.org/project/netbox-notices)

**Original Project:** Forked and inspired from [jasonyates/netbox-circuitmaintenance](https://github.com/jasonyates/netbox-circuitmaintenance), differs in the ability to track more than just maintenances, and circuits.

A NetBox plugin built to track maintenance and outage events across various NetBox models. This plugin is agnostic in that it is only built to store data surrounding maintenance/outage events and provide an overview of historical, active and upcoming events. The plugin tracks events at the provider level and associates impact across multiple NetBox object types (circuits, devices, virtual machines, power feeds, sites, etc.).

The plugin does not directly provide an automated approach to ingesting provider notifications, instead it extends NetBox's extensive REST API and provides GET/POST/PUT/PATCH methods to manage events. The plugin is intended to be coupled with an automated parser to handle the parsing of provider notifications and the delivery of the events to the plugin's REST API. Several example parsers are [documented here](https://jsenecal.github.io/netbox-notices/parsers/).

**Important Note:** This is a significant refactoring from the original `netbox-circuitmaintenance` plugin. **There is no upgrade path** from the original plugin. If you are using the original plugin, you will need to migrate your data manually.

## Features

- Track provider maintenance events
- Track impact from provider maintenance across multiple NetBox object types

## Compatibility

This plugin requires NetBox 4.4.1 or higher.

| NetBox Version | Plugin Version |
| -------------- | -------------- |
| 4.4.1+         | 0.2.x         |

## Installing

A working installation of Netbox 4.4.1+ is required - [see official documentation](https://netbox.readthedocs.io/en/stable/plugins/).

### Package Installation

Activate your virtual env and install via pip:

```bash
$ source /opt/netbox/venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ pip install netbox-notices
```

To ensure the plugin is automatically re-installed during future upgrades, add the package to your `local_requirements.txt`:

```bash
# echo netbox-notices >> local_requirements.txt
```

### Enable the Plugin

In the Netbox `configuration.py` configuration file add or update the PLUGINS parameter, adding `vendor_notification`:

```python
PLUGINS = [
    'notices'
]

PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "notices": {},
}
```

### Configuration

The plugin supports configuration of which NetBox object types can be linked to maintenance and outage events. By default, the plugin allows linking to circuits, power feeds, and sites.

#### Default Configuration

If you don't specify any configuration, the plugin uses these defaults:

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "notices": {
        "allowed_content_types": [
            "circuits.Circuit",
            "dcim.PowerFeed",
            "dcim.Site",
        ]
    }
}
```

#### Custom Configuration

You can customize which object types are allowed by specifying the `allowed_content_types` setting. Content types are specified in the format `app_label.model_name`.

##### Example: Add Devices and Virtual Machines

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "notices": {
        "allowed_content_types": [
            "circuits.Circuit",
            "dcim.Device",
            "dcim.PowerFeed",
            "dcim.Site",
            "virtualization.VirtualMachine",
        ]
    }
}
```

##### Example: Minimal Configuration (Circuits Only)

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "notices": {
        "allowed_content_types": [
            "circuits.Circuit",
        ]
    }
}
```

##### Example: Extended Configuration

```python
PLUGINS_CONFIG = {
    "notices": {
        "allowed_content_types": [
            "circuits.Circuit",
            "dcim.Device",
            "dcim.Interface",
            "dcim.PowerFeed",
            "dcim.Rack",
            "dcim.Site",
            "ipam.IPAddress",
            "ipam.Prefix",
            "virtualization.VirtualMachine",
            "virtualization.VMInterface",
        ]
    }
}
```

##### How Configuration Affects Behavior

- Only object types listed in `allowed_content_types` will appear in the Impact creation forms
- The API will reject attempts to create impacts for non-allowed object types
- Changing the configuration requires a NetBox restart
- This setting controls which objects can be linked via the `Impact` model to maintenance and outage events

##### Common NetBox Object Types

| Content Type                    | Description               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `circuits.Circuit`              | Network circuits          |
| `circuits.Provider`             | Service providers         |
| `dcim.Device`                   | Physical network devices  |
| `dcim.Interface`                | Device network interfaces |
| `dcim.PowerFeed`                | Power supply connections  |
| `dcim.PowerPanel`               | Power distribution panels |
| `dcim.Rack`                     | Equipment racks           |
| `dcim.Site`                     | Physical locations        |
| `ipam.IPAddress`                | IP addresses              |
| `ipam.Prefix`                   | IP prefixes/subnets       |
| `virtualization.VirtualMachine` | Virtual machines          |
| `virtualization.VMInterface`    | VM network interfaces     |

### Apply Database Migrations

Apply database migrations with Netbox `manage.py`:

```bash
(venv) $ python manage.py migrate
```

### Restart Netbox

Restart the Netbox service to apply changes:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart netbox
```

## Outage Tracking

In addition to planned maintenance, this plugin supports tracking unplanned outage events:

### Key Features

- **Optional End Time**: Outages can be created without an end time, which becomes required when marking as resolved
- **ETR Tracking**: Track Estimated Time to Repair with full revision history via NetBox's changelog
- **Outage Status Workflow**:
  - REPORTED: Initial state when outage is reported
  - INVESTIGATING: Team is investigating root cause
  - IDENTIFIED: Root cause identified, working on fix
  - MONITORING: Fix applied, monitoring for stability
  - RESOLVED: Outage fully resolved (requires end time)
- **Shared Impact Model**: Uses the same impact tracking as maintenance events (Impact model)
- **Unified View**: View both maintenance and outages together in a single interface
- **Flexible Object Support**: Link outages to any configured NetBox object type

### API Endpoints

    "outage": 1,
    "content_type": "dcim.device",
    "object_id": 123,
    "impact": "DEGRADED"
}
```

## Data Models

The plugin uses four main models to track maintenance and outage events:

### Maintenance

Represents a planned maintenance event from a provider. Key fields:

- `name`: Event identifier
- `summary`: Description of the maintenance
- `provider`: Foreign key to NetBox Provider
- `start`, `end`: Maintenance window times
- `status`: TENTATIVE, CONFIRMED, CANCELLED, IN-PROCESS, COMPLETED, RE-SCHEDULED, UNKNOWN
- `internal_ticket`: Your organization's tracking ticket reference
- `acknowledged`: Whether the event has been acknowledged

### Outage

Represents an unplanned outage event from a provider. Key fields:

- `name`: Event identifier
- `summary`: Description of the outage
- `provider`: Foreign key to NetBox Provider
- `start`, `end`: Outage window times (end is optional until resolved)
- `status`: REPORTED, INVESTIGATING, IDENTIFIED, MONITORING, RESOLVED
- `estimated_time_to_repair`: ETR timestamp (tracked with changelog history)
- `internal_ticket`: Your organization's tracking ticket reference
- `acknowledged`: Whether the event has been acknowledged

### Impact

Links maintenance or outage events to affected NetBox objects using Django's Generic Foreign Key pattern:

- `maintenance` or `outage`: Foreign key to the event (mutually exclusive)
- `content_type`: The type of affected object (e.g., "circuits.circuit", "dcim.device")
- `object_id`: The ID of the affected object
- `impact`: Impact level - NO-IMPACT, REDUCED-REDUNDANCY, DEGRADED, OUTAGE

The Impact model allows linking events to **any NetBox object type** configured in `allowed_content_types`.

### EventNotification

Stores raw email notifications received from providers:

- `maintenance` or `outage`: Foreign key to the associated event
- `email`: Binary email data
- `email_body`: Extracted body text
- `subject`: Email subject line
- `email_from`: Sender address
- `email_received`: Receipt timestamp
