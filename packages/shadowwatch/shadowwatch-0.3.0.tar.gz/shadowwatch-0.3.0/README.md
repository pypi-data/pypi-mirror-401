**"Like a shadow — always there, never seen."**

Behavioral intelligence for your application. Add passive behavioral biometrics, personalization, and fraud detection with zero user friction.

## What It Does

Shadow Watch silently learns user behavior patterns and uses them for:

- **🔐 Security:** Behavioral biometric authentication (detects account takeovers)
- **🎯 Personalization:** Auto-generates interest profiles based on activity
- **🤖 Intent Prediction:** Understands what users care about without asking
- **🚨 Fraud Detection:** Flags suspicious behavior before damage happens

## Installation

```bash
# Basic installation
pip install shadowwatch

# With Redis support (recommended for production)
pip install shadowwatch[redis]

# With FastAPI integration
pip install shadowwatch[fastapi]
```

## Quick Start

```python
from shadowwatch import ShadowWatch

# Initialize with your database
sw = ShadowWatch(
    database_url="postgresql+asyncpg://user:pass@localhost/db",
    license_key="SW-TRIAL-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX"  # Get trial at shadowwatch.dev
)

# Track user activity (silent, no UI)
await sw.track(
    user_id=123,
    entity_id="AAPL",
    action="view"
)

# Get user profile
profile = await sw.get_profile(user_id=123)
# Returns: {"total_items": 42, "fingerprint": "a7f9e2c4...", "library": [...]}

# Verify login (trust score)
trust = await sw.verify_login(
    user_id=123,
    request_context={
        "ip": "192.168.1.1",
        "user_agent": "...",
        "library_fingerprint": "..."  # From client cache
    }
)
# Returns: {"trust_score": 0.85, "risk_level": "low", "action": "allow"}
```

## How It Works

1. **Silent Tracking:** Every user action (views, searches, trades) is logged
2. **Interest Scoring:** Actions aggregate into weighted interest scores
3. **Fingerprinting:** Top interests generate a unique behavioral fingerprint
4. **Trust Calculation:** Fingerprint mismatch = suspicious login attempt

## Use Cases

### Fintech Apps
- Detect account takeover attempts
- Behavioral 2FA (no user friction)
- Portfolio-aware personalization

### E-commerce
- Predict purchase intent
- Fraud detection
- Product recommendations

### Trading Platforms
- Smart watchlists
- Pattern-based alerts
- Risk profiling

## Features

✅ **Zero User Friction** - Works silently, no prompts  
✅ **Passive Authentication** - Behavioral biometric layer  
✅ **Auto-Generated Profiles** - based on actual behavior  
✅ **Investment Priority** - Trades weighted 10x higher than views  
✅ **Self-Hosted** - Runs on YOUR infrastructure  
✅ **Privacy-First** - Your data never leaves your servers  

## Database Setup

Shadow Watch uses 3 tables:

```bash
# Create tables (SQLAlchemy)
from shadowwatch.models import Base
async with engine.begin() as conn:
    await conn.run_sync(Base.metadata.create_all)
```

Tables created:
- `shadow_watch_activity_events` (raw events)
- `shadow_watch_interests` (aggregated scores)
- `shadow_watch_library_versions` (snapshots)
