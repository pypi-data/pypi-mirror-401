    Responsibility:
    - Combine multiple trust signals
    - Calculate weighted ensemble score
    - Determine risk level and recommended action
    - Provide transparency (show factor breakdown)
    
    Ensemble Weights:
    - IP/Location: 30% (is IP known/trusted?)
    - Device Fingerprint: 25% (is device recognized?)
    - Shadow Watch Library: 20% (does behavior match?)
    - Time Pattern: 15% (usual login time?)
    - API Behavior: 10% (rate limits, abuse patterns)
    
    Usage:
    Called during:
    - Login verification
    - Sensitive operations (withdrawal, settings change)
    - Account recovery requests
    
    NOTE: Current implementation uses simplified placeholders for IP/device/time.
    Users should implement their own IP tracker, device tracker, time analyzer
    for production use. Shadow Watch provides only the behavioral fingerprint (20%).
