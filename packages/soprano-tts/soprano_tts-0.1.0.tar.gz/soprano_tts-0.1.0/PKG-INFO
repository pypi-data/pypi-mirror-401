           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

## Overview

**Soprano** is an ultra‑lightweight, on-device text‑to‑speech (TTS) model designed for expressive, high‑fidelity speech synthesis at unprecedented speed. Soprano was designed with the following features:
- Up to **2000x** real-time generation on GPU and **20x** real-time on CPU
- **Lossless streaming** with **<15 ms** latency on GPU, **<250 ms** on CPU
- **<1 GB** memory usage with a compact 80M parameter architecture
- **Infinite generation length** with automatic text splitting
- Highly expressive, crystal clear audio generation at **32kHz**
- Widespread support for CUDA, CPU, and MPS devices on Windows, Linux, and Mac
- Supports WebUI, CLI, and OpenAI-compatible endpoint for easy and production-ready inference

## Installation

### Install with wheel (CUDA)

```bash
pip install soprano-tts[lmdeploy]
```

### Install with wheel (CPU/MPS)

```bash
pip install soprano-tts
```

To get the latest features, you can install from source instead.

### Install from source (CUDA)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano.git
cd soprano
pip install -e .[lmdeploy]
```

### Install from source (CPU/MPS)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ekwek1/soprano.git
cd soprano
pip install -e .
```

> ### ⚠️ Warning: Windows CUDA users
> 
> On Windows with CUDA, `pip` will install a CPU-only PyTorch build. To ensure CUDA support works as expected, reinstall PyTorch explicitly with the correct CUDA wheel **after** installing Soprano:
> 
> ```bash
> pip uninstall -y torch
> pip install torch==2.8.0 --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu128
> ```

---

## Usage

### WebUI

Start WebUI:

```bash
soprano-webui # hosted on http://127.0.0.1:7860 by default
```
> **Tip:** You can increase cache size and decoder batch size to increase inference speed at the cost of higher memory usage. For example:
> ```bash
> soprano-webui --cache-size 1000 --decoder-batch-size 4
> ```

### CLI

```
soprano "Soprano is an extremely lightweight text to speech model."

optional arguments:
  --output, -o                  Output audio file path (non-streaming only). Defaults to 'output.wav'
  --model-path, -m              Path to local model directory (optional)
  --device, -d                  Device to use for inference. Supported: auto, cuda, cpu, mps. Defaults to 'auto'
  --backend, -b                 Backend to use for inference. Supported: auto, transformers, lmdeploy. Defaults to 'auto'
  --cache-size, -c              Cache size in MB (for lmdeploy backend). Defaults to 100
  --decoder-batch-size, -bs     Decoder batch size. Defaults to 1
  --streaming, -s               Enable streaming playback to speakers
```
> **Tip:** You can increase cache size and decoder batch size to increase inference speed at the cost of higher memory usage.

> **Note:** The CLI will reload the model every time it is called. As a result, inference speed will be slower than other methods.

### OpenAI-compatible endpoint

Start server:

```bash
uvicorn soprano.server:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Use the endpoint like this:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/v1/audio/speech \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "input": "Soprano is an extremely lightweight text to speech model."
  }' \
  --output speech.wav
```

> **Note:** Currently, this endpoint only supports nonstreaming output.

### Python script

```python
from soprano import SopranoTTS

model = SopranoTTS(backend='auto', device='auto', cache_size_mb=100, decoder_batch_size=1)
```

> **Tip:** You can increase cache_size_mb and decoder_batch_size to increase inference speed at the cost of higher memory usage.

```python
# Basic inference
out = model.infer("Soprano is an extremely lightweight text to speech model.") # can achieve 2000x real-time with sufficiently long input!

# Save output to a file
out = model.infer("Soprano is an extremely lightweight text to speech model.", "out.wav")

# Custom sampling parameters
out = model.infer(
    "Soprano is an extremely lightweight text to speech model.",
    temperature=0.3,
    top_p=0.95,
    repetition_penalty=1.2,
)


# Batched inference
out = model.infer_batch(["Soprano is an extremely lightweight text to speech model."] * 10) # can achieve 2000x real-time with sufficiently large input size!

# Save batch outputs to a directory
out = model.infer_batch(["Soprano is an extremely lightweight text to speech model."] * 10, "/dir")


# Streaming inference
from soprano.utils.streaming import play_stream
stream = model.infer_stream("Soprano is an extremely lightweight text to speech model.", chunk_size=1)
play_stream(stream) # plays audio with <15 ms latency!
```

## Usage tips:

* Soprano works best when each sentence is between 2 and 15 seconds long.
* Although Soprano recognizes numbers and some special characters, it occasionally mispronounces them. Best results can be achieved by converting these into their phonetic form. (1+1 -> one plus one, etc)
* If Soprano produces unsatisfactory results, you can easily regenerate it for a new, potentially better generation. You may also change the sampling settings for more varied results.
* Avoid improper grammar such as not using contractions, multiple spaces, etc.

## Roadmap

* [x] Add model and inference code
* [x] Seamless streaming
* [x] Batched inference
* [x] Command-line interface (CLI)
* [x] CPU support
* [x] Server / API inference
* [ ] ROCm support (see [#29](/../../issues/29))
* [ ] Additional LLM backends
* [ ] Voice cloning
* [ ] Multilingual support

---

## Limitations

Soprano is currently English-only and does not support voice cloning. In addition, Soprano was trained on only 1,000 hours of audio (~100x less than other TTS models), so mispronunciation of uncommon words may occur. This is expected to diminish as Soprano is trained on more data.
