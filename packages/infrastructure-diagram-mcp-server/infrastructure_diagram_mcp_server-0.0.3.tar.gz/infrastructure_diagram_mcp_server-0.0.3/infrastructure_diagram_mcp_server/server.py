    instructions="""Use this server to generate professional infrastructure diagrams for any cloud provider, on-premises, or hybrid environments using the Python diagrams package.

WORKFLOW:
1. list_icons:
   - Discover all available icons in the diagrams package
   - Browse providers (AWS, GCP, Azure, K8s, on-prem, SaaS), services, and icons organized hierarchically
   - Find the exact import paths for icons you want to use
   - Supports filtering by provider and service for efficient discovery

2. get_diagram_examples:
   - Request example code for the diagram type you need
   - Available types: aws, gcp, azure, k8s, onprem, hybrid, multicloud, sequence, flow, class, custom, or all
   - Study the examples to understand the diagram package's syntax and capabilities
   - Use these examples as templates for your own diagrams
   - Each example demonstrates different features and diagram structures

3. generate_diagram:
   - Write Python code using the diagrams package DSL based on the examples
   - Submit your code to generate both PNG and editable .drawio files
   - Optionally specify a filename
   - The diagram is generated with show=False to prevent automatic display
   - The .drawio file can be opened for further editing
   - IMPORTANT: Always provide the workspace_dir parameter to save diagrams in the user's current directory

SUPPORTED INFRASTRUCTURE TYPES:
- AWS: EC2, Lambda, S3, RDS, EKS, and 200+ other services
- GCP: Cloud Functions, Cloud Run, BigQuery, GKE, Dataflow, and more
- Azure: App Service, Functions, AKS, Cosmos DB, Synapse, and more
- Kubernetes: Pods, Services, Deployments, StatefulSets, Ingress, and more
- On-premises: Servers, databases, networking, storage, proxies, and more
- Hybrid: Combinations of on-premises and cloud infrastructure
- Multi-cloud: Architectures spanning multiple cloud providers
- SaaS: GitHub, Slack, Datadog, and other third-party services
- Generic: Platform-agnostic compute, storage, network, and database components
- Sequence diagrams: Process and interaction flows
- Flow diagrams: Decision trees and workflows
- Class diagrams: Object relationships and inheritance
- Custom diagrams: Using custom nodes and icons from URLs

IMPORTANT:
- Always start with get_diagram_examples to understand the syntax for your target platform
- Use the list_icons tool to discover all available icons (filter by provider for efficiency)
- The code must include a Diagram() definition
- Diagrams are saved in multiple formats (PNG and .drawio) in a "generated-diagrams" subdirectory of the user's workspace by default
- The .drawio files can be edited in diagrams.net/draw.io for further customization
- If an absolute path is provided as filename, it will be used directly
- Diagram generation has a default timeout of 90 seconds
- For complex diagrams, consider breaking them into smaller components
- Use Clusters to organize and group related infrastructure components
- Use Edge() for custom connection styling (color, style, labels)""",

    """Generate a diagram from Python code using the diagrams package.

    This tool accepts Python code as a string that uses the diagrams package DSL
    and generates both PNG and editable .drawio files. The code is executed with
    show=False to prevent automatic display.

    USAGE INSTRUCTIONS:
    Never import. Start writing code immediately with `with Diagram(` and use the icons you found with list_icons.
    1. First use get_diagram_examples to understand the syntax and capabilities
    2. Then use list_icons to discover all available icons. These are the only icons you can work with.
    3. You MUST use icon names exactly as they are in the list_icons response, case-sensitive.
    4. Write your diagram code following python diagrams examples. Do not import any additional icons or packages, the runtime already imports everything needed.
    5. Submit your code to this tool to generate the diagram
    6. The tool returns paths to both the PNG image and editable .drawio file
    7. For complex diagrams, consider using Clusters to organize components
    8. Diagrams should start with a user or end device on the left, with data flowing to the right.

    CODE REQUIREMENTS:
    - Must include a Diagram() definition with appropriate parameters
    - Can use any of the supported diagram components (AWS, K8s, etc.)
    - Can include custom styling with Edge attributes (color, style)
    - Can use Cluster to group related components
    - Can use custom icons with the Custom class

    COMMON PATTERNS:
    - Basic: provider.service("label")
    - Connections: service1 >> service2 >> service3
    - Grouping: with Cluster("name"): [components]
    - Styling: service1 >> Edge(color="red", style="dashed") >> service2

    IMPORTANT FOR CLINE: Always send the current workspace directory when calling this tool!
    The workspace_dir parameter should be set to the directory where the user is currently working
    so that diagrams are saved to a location accessible to the user.

    Supported diagram types:
    - AWS architecture diagrams
    - Sequence diagrams
    - Flow diagrams
    - Class diagrams
    - Kubernetes diagrams
    - On-premises diagrams
    - Custom diagrams with custom nodes

    Returns:
        List containing:
        - TextContent with success message and paths to both PNG and .drawio files
        - ImageContent with the generated diagram (PNG) for immediate display

    OUTPUT FILES:
        - PNG diagram: For immediate viewing and sharing
        - .drawio file: Editable diagram that can be opened in diagrams.net/draw.io for further customization

    2. Study the returned examples to understand the structure and syntax
    3. Use these examples as templates for your own diagrams
    4. When ready, modify an example or write your own code and use generate_diagram

    1. Call without filters to get a list of available providers

    - Second call: list_icons(provider_filter="aws") → Returns all AWS services and icons
    - Third call: list_icons(provider_filter="aws", service_filter="compute") → Returns AWS compute icons
