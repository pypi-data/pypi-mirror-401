  "markdown": "# Query Agent: BSL Skills for AI Coding Assistants\n\nAI coding assistants can help you build and maintain your semantic model, but they don't know about BSL out of the box.\n\nThe easiest way to provide this context is to use the `bsl` CLI, which copies pre-built prompts into your agent's config folder.\n\n## Installation\n\n### Claude Code\n\n```bash\nbsl skill install claude-code\n```\n\nOr manually copy the prompt from [`skills/claude-code/`](https://github.com/boringdata/boring-semantic-layer/tree/main/docs/md/skills/claude-code/) to `.claude/skills/bsl-query-expert/SKILL.md`\n\n### Claude Desktop\n\n1. Open Claude Desktop and click **Skills -> New Skill**.\n2. Run `bsl skill show claude-code` and copy the output into the editor.\n3. Name it something memorable like \"BSL Query Expert\" and save.\n4. Add optional tags (\"data\", \"analytics\") so you can search for it quickly.\n\n### Cursor\n\n```bash\nbsl skill install cursor\n```\n\nOr manually copy the prompt from [`skills/cursor/`](https://github.com/boringdata/boring-semantic-layer/tree/main/docs/md/skills/cursor) to `.cursorrules` in your project root\n\n### Codex (OpenAI)\n\n```bash\nbsl skill install codex\n```\n\nOr manually copy the prompt from [`skills/codex/`](https://github.com/boringdata/boring-semantic-layer/tree/main/docs/md/skills/codex) to your Codex system instructions\n\n## CLI Reference\n\n```bash\n# List available skills\nbsl skill list\n\n# Preview a skill before installing\nbsl skill show claude-code\n\n# Install a skill to your project\nbsl skill install claude-code\nbsl skill install cursor\nbsl skill install codex\n\n# Overwrite existing file\nbsl skill install cursor --force\n```\n",
