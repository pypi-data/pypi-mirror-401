  "markdown": "# Query Agent\n\nThe Query Agent lets you ask natural-language questions about your semantic tables.\n\nIt converts a user prompt into a valid BSL query and returns the resulting table or chart along with a concise summary.\n\nYou can expose the Query Agent in three ways, depending on your workflow:\n\n### [MCP Server](/agents/mcp)\n\nExpose your tables to any LLM via the Model Context Protocol.\n\n- **Pros:** All major LLM providers support MCP out-of-the-box\n- **Cons:** Requires running an MCP server alongside your project\n\n### [LLM Tool](/agents/tool)\n\nLet the model execute BSL queries directly as a callable tool.\n\n- **Pros:** No additional infrastructure\u2014the LLM executes queries inline\n- **Cons:** Requires a sandboxing solution for production use\n\n### [AI Skills (CLI)](/agents/skill)\n\nAdd BSL querying to your local coding assistant (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex).\n\n- **Pros:** Fastest setup\u2014run `bsl skill install` and you're ready\n- **Cons:** Runs locally only\n\n---\n\nWant to try it out? The [Demo Chat](/agents/chat) provides a built-in CLI interface to explore your semantic models using natural language.\n",
