# YAML Configuration

Define your semantic models using YAML for better organization and maintainability.

## Why YAML?

YAML configuration provides several advantages:
- **Better organization**: Keep your model definitions separate from your code
- **Version control**: Track changes to your data model structure
- **Collaboration**: Non-developers can review and understand the model
- **Reusability**: Share model definitions across different projects

## Expression Syntax

Here's a complete example with dimensions, measures, and joins:

<yamlcontent path="yaml_example.yaml"></yamlcontent>

<note type="warning">
In YAML configuration, **only unbound syntax (`_`) is accepted** for expressions. Lambda expressions are not supported in YAML files.
</note>

## Loading YAML Models

### Option 1: Using Profiles (Recommended)

```yaml
# File-level profile
profile: my_db

flights:
  table: flights_tbl
  dimensions:
    origin: _.origin
```

```python
from boring_semantic_layer import from_yaml

models = from_yaml("flights_model.yml")
```

See [Profile documentation](/building/profile) for setup details.

### Option 2: Passing Tables Manually

Create your ibis tables:

```yaml_setup
import ibis

flights_tbl = ibis.memtable({
    "origin": ["JFK", "LAX", "SFO"],
    "dest": ["LAX", "SFO", "JFK"],
    "carrier": ["AA", "UA", "DL"],
    "year": [2023, 2023, 2024],
    "distance": [2475, 337, 382]
})

carriers_tbl = ibis.memtable({
    "code": ["AA", "UA", "DL"],
    "name": ["American Airlines", "United Airlines", "Delta Air Lines"]
})
```

And pass them to the loaded YAML file defining your Semantic Tables:

```load_yaml_example
from boring_semantic_layer import from_yaml

# Load models from YAML file with explicit tables
models = from_yaml(
    "yaml_example.yaml",
    tables={
        "flights_tbl": flights_tbl,
        "carriers_tbl": carriers_tbl
    }
)

flights_sm = models["flights"]
carriers_sm = models["carriers"]

# Inspect the loaded models
flights_sm.dimensions, flights_sm.measures
```

<regularoutput code-block="load_yaml_example"></regularoutput> 

### Option 3: Loading from a Dictionary (`from_config`)

If you're loading configuration through your own mechanism (e.g., Kedro catalog, external config management), you can use `from_config()` to construct semantic models directly from a Python dictionary:

```python
from boring_semantic_layer import from_config

config = {
    "flights": {
        "table": "flights_tbl",
        "dimensions": {
            "origin": "_.origin",
            "destination": "_.dest",
        },
        "measures": {
            "flight_count": "_.count()",
            "avg_distance": "_.distance.mean()",
        },
    }
}

models = from_config(config, tables={"flights_tbl": flights_tbl})
flights_sm = models["flights"]
```

This is useful for integrations where you don't want to write config to a file just to load it. The `from_config()` function accepts the same `profile` and `profile_path` parameters as `from_yaml()`:

```python
# With a profile
models = from_config(config, profile="my_db")

# With profile in config
config = {
    "profile": "my_db",
    "flights": {
        "table": "flights_tbl",
        ...
    }
}
models = from_config(config)
```

## Querying YAML Models

YAML-defined models work exactly like Python-defined models. You can use the same `group_by()` and `aggregate()` methods to query your data.

```query_yaml_model
# Query the YAML-defined model
result = (
    flights_sm
    .group_by("origin")
    .aggregate("flight_count", "avg_distance")
)
```

<bslquery code-block="query_yaml_model"></bslquery>

## Filters

You can apply a filter to all queries on a model by adding a `filter` field:

```yaml
flights:
  table: flights_tbl
  filter: _.year > 2020  # Applied to all queries
  dimensions:
    origin: _.origin
  measures:
    flight_count: _.count()
```

The filter expression uses the same `_` syntax as dimensions and measures. It's applied automatically when you query the model.
