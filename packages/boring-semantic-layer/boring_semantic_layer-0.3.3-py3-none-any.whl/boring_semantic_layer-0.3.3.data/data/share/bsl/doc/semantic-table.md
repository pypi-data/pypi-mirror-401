# Building a Semantic Table

Define your data model with dimensions and measures using Ibis expressions.

## Overview

A Semantic Table is the core building block of BSL. It transforms a raw Ibis table into a reusable, self-documenting data model by defining:
- **Dimensions**: Attributes to group by (e.g., origin, carrier, year)
- **Measures**: Aggregations and calculations (e.g., flight count, total distance)

## to_semantic_table()

```setup_flights
import ibis
from boring_semantic_layer import to_semantic_table

# 1. Start with an Ibis table
con = ibis.duckdb.connect(":memory:")
flights_data = ibis.memtable({
    "origin": ["JFK", "LAX", "SFO"],
    "dest": ["LAX", "SFO", "JFK"],
    "carrier": ["AA", "UA", "DL"],
    "year": [2023, 2023, 2024],
    "distance": [2475, 337, 382],
    "dep_delay": [10, 5, 0]
})
flights_tbl = con.create_table("flights", flights_data)

# 2. Convert to a Semantic Table
flights_st = to_semantic_table(flights_tbl, name="flights")
```

## with_dimensions()

Dimensions define the attributes you can group by in your queries. They represent the categorical or descriptive aspects of your data that you want to analyze.

You can define dimensions using lambda expressions, unbound syntax (`_.`), or the `Dimension` class with descriptions:

```dimensions_demo
from ibis import _
from boring_semantic_layer import Dimension

flights_st = flights_st.with_dimensions(
    # Lambda expressions - simple and explicit
    origin=lambda t: t.origin,

    # Unbound syntax - cleaner and more concise
    destination=_.dest,
    year=_.year,

    # Dimension - self-documenting and AI-friendly
    carrier=Dimension(
        expr=lambda t: t.carrier,
        description="Airline carrier code"
    )
)

flights_st.dimensions
```
<regularoutput code-block="dimensions_demo"></regularoutput>

## with_measures()

Measures define the aggregations and calculations you can query. They represent the quantitative aspects of your data that you want to analyze (counts, sums, averages, etc.).

You can define measures using lambda expressions, reference other measures for composition, or use the `Measure` class with descriptions:

```measures_demo
from boring_semantic_layer import Measure

flights_st = flights_st.with_measures(
    # Lambda expressions - simple and concise
    total_flights=lambda t: t.count(),
    total_distance=lambda t: t.distance.sum(),
    max_delay=lambda t: t.dep_delay.max(),

    # Reference other measures for composition
    avg_distance_per_flight=lambda t: t.total_distance / t.total_flights,

    # Measure - self-documenting and AI-friendly
    avg_distance=Measure(
        expr=lambda t: t.distance.mean(),
        description="Average flight distance in miles"
    )
)

flights_st.measures
```

<regularoutput code-block="measures_demo"></regularoutput>

### all()

The `all()` function references the entire dataset within measure definitions, enabling percent-of-total and comparison calculations.

**Example:** Calculate market share as a percentage

```measure_all_demo
flights_with_pct = flights_st.with_measures(
        flight_count=lambda t: t.count(),
        market_share=lambda t: t.flight_count / t.all(t.flight_count) * 100  # Percent of total
    )

# Query by carrier
result = (
    flights_with_pct
    .group_by("carrier")
    .aggregate("flight_count", "market_share")
)
```

<bslquery code-block="measure_all_demo"></bslquery>

<note type="info">
`t.all()` is a method available on the table parameter `t` in measure definitions. It references the entire dataset regardless of grouping, making it perfect for calculating percentages, or comparing groups to the total.
</note>

For more examples, see the [Percent of Total pattern](/advanced/percentage-total).

## graph

The `graph` property provides a dependency graph showing how dimensions and measures relate to each other. This is useful for:
- **Understanding dependencies**: See what columns or fields each dimension/measure depends on
- **Impact analysis**: Find what breaks when changing a field
- **Documentation**: Generate visual representations of your data model
- **Validation**: Ensure your model doesn't have circular dependencies

```graph_demo
# Build a semantic table with dependencies
flights_with_deps = flights_st.with_dimensions(
    origin=lambda t: t.origin,
    destination=lambda t: t.dest,
).with_measures(
    flight_count=lambda t: t.count(),
    total_distance=lambda t: t.distance.sum(),
    avg_distance_per_flight=lambda t: t.total_distance / t.flight_count
)

# Access the dependency graph
graph = flights_with_deps.get_graph()
graph
```
<regularoutput code-block="graph_demo"></regularoutput>

### Understanding the Graph Structure

The graph is a dictionary where:
- **Keys**: Dimension or measure names
- **Values**: Metadata containing:
  - `deps`: Dependencies mapped to their types (`'column'`, `'dimension'`, or `'measure'`)
  - `type`: The field type (`'dimension'`, `'measure'`, or `'calc_measure'`)

```graph_structure
# Access the graph - it's a dict-like object
graph = flights_with_deps.get_graph()
graph
```
<regularoutput code-block="graph_structure"></regularoutput>

```python
# Find what a specific field depends on
flights_with_deps.get_graph()['avg_distance_per_flight']['deps']
# Output: {'total_distance': 'measure', 'flight_count': 'measure'}
```

### Graph Traversal

Use `graph_predecessors()` and `graph_successors()` to navigate dependencies:

```graph_traversal
from boring_semantic_layer import graph_predecessors, graph_successors

graph = flights_with_deps.get_graph()

# What does this field depend on? (predecessors)
graph_predecessors(graph, 'avg_distance_per_flight')
# {'total_distance', 'flight_count'}

# What depends on this field? (successors)
graph_successors(graph, 'total_distance')
# {'avg_distance_per_flight'}
```
<regularoutput code-block="graph_traversal"></regularoutput>

### Working with the Dependency Graph

The dependency graph is a dict-like object where each key is a field name and the value is a dict with `"type"` (dimension/measure/calc_measure/column) and `"deps"` (dependencies with their types):

```python
# Access the graph directly as a dict
graph = flights_with_deps.get_graph()

# Iterate over fields and their dependencies
for field, info in graph.items():
    print(f"{field} ({info['type']}): depends on {info['deps']}")
```

## join_one() / join_many() / join_cross()

Join semantic tables together to query across relationships. Joins allow you to combine data from multiple semantic tables and access dimensions and measures across all joined tables.

**What Makes Semantic Joins Different?**

Semantic joins explicitly capture the **relationship type** between tables, rather than just specifying SQL join mechanics:

**SQL Joins:**
```python
# Specifies HOW to join (LEFT/INNER), but not the relationship
flights.join(carriers, condition, how="left")
```

**Semantic Joins:**
```python
# Specifies the relationship: one carrier has many flights
flights.join_many(carriers, lambda f, c: f.carrier == c.code)
```

**What You Get:**
- **Explicit relationships**: `join_many()` documents that this is a one-to-many relationship
- **Table hierarchy information**: The method name describes how tables relate to each other
- **Richer metadata**: Makes the data model structure explicit for documentation and tooling

<note type="info">
After joining, dimensions and measures are prefixed with table names (e.g., `flights.origin`, `carriers.name`) to avoid naming conflicts.
</note>

<note type="warning">
**Joining the same table multiple times?** If you need to join to the same source table via different foreign keys (e.g., pickup and dropoff locations), you must use `.view()` to create distinct table references:

```python
# Create distinct references when joining same table twice
pickup_locs = to_semantic_table(locs_tbl.view(), "pickup_locs")
dropoff_locs = to_semantic_table(locs_tbl.view(), "dropoff_locs")
```

Without `.view()`, you'll encounter an `IbisInputError: Ambiguous field reference` error. 
</note>

Let's get some additional data:

```setup_carriers
import ibis
from boring_semantic_layer import to_semantic_table

con = ibis.duckdb.connect(":memory:")

# Create carriers data
carriers_data = ibis.memtable({
    "code": ["AA", "UA", "DL"],
    "name": ["American Airlines", "United Airlines", "Delta Air Lines"]
})
carriers_tbl = con.create_table("carriers", carriers_data)
```
<collapsedcodeblock code-block="setup_carriers" title="Create carriers Ibis table"></collapsedcodeblock>

And create a carriers semantic table:

```carriers_st
carriers = (
    to_semantic_table(carriers_tbl, name="carriers")
    .with_dimensions(
        code=lambda t: t.code,
        name=lambda t: t.name
    )
    .with_measures(
        carrier_count=lambda t: t.count()
    )
)
```

### join_many() - One-to-Many Relationships

Use `join_many()` when one row in the left table can match multiple rows in the right table (LEFT JOIN).

```join_demo
# Join carriers to flights - one carrier has many flights
flights_with_carriers = flights_st.join_many(
    carriers,
    lambda f, c: f.carrier == c.code
)

# Inspect available dimensions and measures
flights_with_carriers.dimensions
```
<regularoutput code-block="join_demo"></regularoutput>

After joining, all dimensions and measures from both tables are available. Each is prefixed with its table name to avoid conflicts:


### join_one() - One-to-One Relationships

Use `join_one()` when rows have a unique matching relationship (INNER JOIN).

```python
# Many flights → one carrier (each flight has exactly one carrier)
flights_with_carrier = flights_st.join_one(
    carriers,
    lambda f, c: f.carrier == c.code
)
```

<note type="warning">
**Important Limitation:** Currently, `left_on` and `right_on` must be **COLUMN names**, not dimension names.

If you have a dimension that maps to a different column name, you must use the underlying column name in the join.

**Example:**
```python
# If users table has column 'id' but dimension 'customer_id':
users = to_semantic_table(users_tbl).with_dimensions(
    customer_id=lambda t: t.id  # Dimension renamed
)

# ❌ This will fail with a helpful error:
orders.join_one(users, left_on="customer_id", right_on="customer_id")

# ✓ Use the actual column name:
orders.join_one(users, left_on="customer_id", right_on="id")
```

This is a known limitation tracked in [issue #43](https://github.com/boringdata/boring-semantic-layer/issues/43). If you attempt to use a dimension name that doesn't match a column name, you'll get a helpful error message guiding you to use the correct column name.
</note>

### join_cross() - Cross Join

Use `join_cross()` to create every possible combination of rows from both tables (CARTESIAN PRODUCT).

```python
# Every flight × every carrier combination
all_combinations = flights_st.join_cross(carriers)
```

### join() - Custom Join Conditions

Use `join()` for complex join conditions or specific SQL join types.

```python
# LEFT JOIN with custom condition
flights_with_carriers = flights_st.join(
    carriers,
    lambda f, c: f.carrier == c.code,
    how="left"
)

# INNER JOIN
flights_matched = flights_st.join(
    carriers,
    lambda f, c: f.carrier == c.code,
    how="inner"
)

# Complex conditions
date_range_join = flights_st.join(
    promotions,
    lambda f, p: (f.date >= p.start_date) & (f.date <= p.end_date),
    how="left"
)
```

**Supported join types:** `"inner"`, `"left"`, `"right"`, `"outer"`, `"cross"`
