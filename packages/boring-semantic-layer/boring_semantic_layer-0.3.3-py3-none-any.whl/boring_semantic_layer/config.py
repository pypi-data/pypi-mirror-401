Global configuration for Boring Semantic Layer.

This module provides configuration options that affect query optimization
and behavior across the library.

Note: Projection pushdown optimization is always enabled and built into the
Relation operations. It automatically filters out unused columns before joins
to reduce data scanned, which is especially beneficial for wide tables.
