    """An audio to text converter using OpenAI Whisper.

    The OpenAIWhisperAudioToText class is responsible for converting audio to text using OpenAI Whisper.
    It supports various audio sources such as file paths, base64 encoded strings, downloadable audio URLs,
    and YouTube URLs.

    Attributes:
        client (OpenAI): The OpenAI client instance used for API requests.
        model (str): The identifier of the OpenAI Whisper model to use for transcription.
        language (str | None): The language of the input audio content.
        prompt (str | None): The text prompt to guide the model's style or continue a previous audio segment.
        temperature (float): The sampling temperature to control output randomness.
        timestamp_granularity (str): The timestamp detail levels to include in the output.
        proxy (str | None): The proxy URL to use for the YouTube request.
        skip_conversion_for_formats (list[str]): List of audio formats that should skip mono FLAC conversion.

        Args:
            api_key (str): The API key for authentication with OpenAI.
            model (str, optional): The model identifier to use for transcription. Defaults to "whisper-1".
            language (str | None, optional): The language of the input audio content. Defaults to None.
            prompt (str | None, optional): The text prompt to guide the model\'s style or continue a previous audio
                segment. The prompt should match the audio language. Defaults to None.
            temperature (float, optional): The sampling temperature to control output randomness. Defaults to 0.
            timestamp_granularity (str, optional): The timestamp detail levels to include in the output.
                The granularity can be "segment" or "word". When set to "segment", OpenAI will return
                transcripts divided into segments of speech. When set to "word", it will include word-level
                timestamps. Defaults to "segment".
            proxy (str | None, optional): The proxy URL to use for the YouTube request. Defaults to None.
            skip_conversion_for_formats (list[str] | None, optional): List of audio formats (e.g., [\'mp3\', \'wav\'])
                that should skip the mono FLAC conversion process. Formats are case-insensitive and can be
                specified with or without a leading dot. If None or empty, all audio will be converted to
                mono FLAC. Defaults to None.
