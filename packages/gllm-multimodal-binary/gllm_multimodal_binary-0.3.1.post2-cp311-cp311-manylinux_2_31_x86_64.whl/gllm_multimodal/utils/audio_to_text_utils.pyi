def convert_audio_to_mono_flac(input_audio_bytes: bytes) -> bytes:
    """Convert audio binary data to mono FLAC format.

    This method standardizes the audio format to mono FLAC to simplify processing by having a consistent
    file extension and single audio channel, while preserving the audio information.

    This method performs two operations:
    1. Converts the input audio to mono (single channel)
    2. Encodes the audio in FLAC format for optimal speech recognition

    FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is chosen because:
    1. Lossless compression preserves audio quality for accurate transcription
    2. More bandwidth efficient compared to uncompressed formats like LINEAR16
    3. supports variable bit depths (16/24-bit) automatically -> no need to specify sample rate

    Mono channel is chosen because:
    1. Speech recognition models are optimized for single-channel audio
    2. Reduces bandwidth and processing overhead
    3. Simplifies processing by avoiding multi-channel complexity
    4. Ensures consistent results across different input formats

        input_audio_bytes (bytes): Input audio data in binary format.

    Returns:
        bytes: Audio data converted to mono FLAC format.

    This function attempts to identify the audio format by reading the audio file metadata.
    The format detection is performed using the soundfile library, which can identify common
    audio formats like MP3, WAV, FLAC, OGG, etc.

    Args:
        audio_binary_data (bytes): The binary data of the audio.

    Returns:
        str | None: The detected audio format in lowercase (e.g., 'mp3', 'wav', 'flac'), or None if detection fails.
