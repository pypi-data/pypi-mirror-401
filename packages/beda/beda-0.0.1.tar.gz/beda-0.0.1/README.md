# BEDA (Python)

**The Binary Epigraphic Data Archive (BEDA) - Python Authoring Tool**

BEDA is a framework for the high-performance serialisation and management of epigraphic data. This Python package provides a high-level authoring interface for scholars and developers.

## Overview

While the core BEDA engine is written in Rust for performance and safety, this Python package serves as the primary tool for:

* **In-code Transcription:** Defining digital inscriptions using native Python classes and Enums.
* **CBOR Compilation:** Converting Python-defined epigraphic structures into the binary-optimised BEDA format (CBOR).
* **Decentralised Authoring:** Allowing scholars to author complex digital inscriptions locally using standard Python scripts, providing an alternative to the BEDA Web Editor.

## Status

**Version 0.0.1 is a placeholder release** to reserve the namespace on PyPI. 

The implementation of the Python authoring classes and the CBOR serialisation logic is currently in private development to protect ongoing academic research concerning digital epigraphy and philology.
