**Purely** is a zero-dependency library designed to bring the best parts of functional programming—safety, pipelines, and immutability—into Python without the academic overhead or complex types. It allows you to write code that reads from top to bottom, rather than inside out.

## 🧠 Motivation

Python is a beautiful language, but production code often becomes cluttered with defensive checks and nested function calls.

1.  **The "None" Paranoia:** We often write 3 lines of code just to check if a variable exists before using it.
2.  **Nested Hell:** Functional transformations often look like `save(validate(parse(read(data))))`, which forces you to read backwards.
3.  **List Comprehension Fatigue:** While powerful, chaining multiple list comprehensions (map/filter/reduce) can quickly become unreadable.

**Purely** solves this with three core tools: `ensure` for assertions, `safe` for null-safe navigation, and `Chain` for fluent pipelines.

## 📦 Installation

**Purely** leverages modern Python features (generics) and requires **Python 3.12+**.

```bash
pip install purely
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### The Old Way vs. The Purely Way

```python
from purely import ensure, safe, Chain

# ❌ The Old Way: Defensive and Nested
user_data = get_user(123)
if user_data is None:
    raise ValueError("User not found")

city = None
if user_data.address and user_data.address.city:
    city = user_data.address.city.name.upper()

# ✅ The Purely Way: Fluent and Safe
user_data = ensure(get_user(123), "User not found")

# Null-safe navigation + Pipeline
city = safe(user_data).address.city.name | str.upper
```

## 📚 User Guide

### 1. `ensure`: The Rusty Unwrap

Stop writing multiline `if x is None` checks. `ensure` asserts that a value is not `None` and returns it, acting as a type-narrowing barrier.
```python
from purely import ensure

# Throws ValueError("API Key missing") if the value is None
api_key = ensure(os.getenv("API_KEY"), "API Key missing")

# Works transparently with Purely's Option/Safe types
name = ensure(safe(user).name)
```

### 2. `safe`: Null-Safe Navigation

Accessing deeply nested attributes on objects that might be `None` is a common source of `AttributeError`. The `safe` utility wraps your object in a proxy that swallows `None` errors gracefully.

**Key Features:**

* **Deep Access:** Navigate attributes, items, or methods arbitrarily deep.
* **IDE Friendly:** Uses type hinting tricks to keep your autocomplete working.
* **Graceful Exit:** If any link in the chain is `None`, the whole chain returns an `Option(None)`.

```python
from purely import safe, ensure

class User:
    def __init__(self, address=None):
        self.address = address

u = User(address=None)

# ❌ Raises AttributeError
# print(u.address.city)

# ✅ Returns Option(None) - No crash
result = safe(u).address.city

# Use ensure() to crash intentionally if the value MUST be there
city = ensure(result, "City is required")
```

### 3. `Chain`: The Fluent Pipe

`Chain` is a unified wrapper that allows you to pipe values through functions and perform vectorized operations on lists.

#### Simple Pipelines

Use `.then()` or the `|` operator to pass data forward.

```python
from purely import Chain

def double(x): return x * 2

# 5 -> 10 -> "10"
result = Chain(5) | double | str
assert result.unwrap() == "10"
```

#### Vectorized Operations

If the wrapped value is a list (or iterable), `.map()` and `.filter()` apply to **each item** in the list, not the list itself.

```python
users = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]

names = (
    Chain(users)
    .filter(lambda name: len(name) > 3)  # Filters list: ["alice", "charlie"]
    .map(lambda name: name.upper())      # Maps list: ["ALICE", "CHARLIE"]
    .unwrap()
)
```

#### Error Handling

`Chain` captures exceptions effectively, allowing you to handle errors at the end of the pipeline.

```python
result = (
    Chain(10)
    .then(lambda x: x / 0)        # Fails internally (ZeroDivisionError)
    .then(lambda x: x + 10)       # Skipped
    .catch(lambda e: "Recovered") # Catches error and returns fallback
    .unwrap()
)
assert result == "Recovered"
```

### 4. `Option`: Functional Safety

Under the hood, `safe` uses `Option`. You can use it directly for functional null handling.

* `.convert(func)`: Transforms value only if it exists.
* `.keepif(predicate)`: Turns value to `None` if predicate fails.
* `.unwrap(default=...)`: Extracts value or returns default.

```python
from purely import Option

val = Option(10).convert(lambda x: x * 2).keepif(lambda x: x > 50)
assert val.is_none()
```

### 5. `curry`: Partial Application

The `curry` decorator transforms a function of multiple arguments into a series of functions. This allows for partial application, which is especially useful when used with `pipe`.
```python
from purely import curry, pipe

@curry
def add(a, b, c):
    return a + b + c

# Partial application allows building functions on the fly
add_ten = add(10)
add_twelve = add_ten(2)

# Perfect for pipelines
result = pipe(
    5,
    add(1, 2), # Equivalent to add(1, 2, 5)
    lambda x: x * 10
)
assert result == 80
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Trade-offs

**Purely** prioritizes developer experience (readability, safety, fluency) over raw performance and strict functional purity. Before adopting it, be aware of the following design choices and trade-offs:

### 1. Eager Evaluation (Not for Big Data)

The `Chain.map()` and `Chain.filter()` methods are **eager**. They immediately consume iterators and materialize results into a list to ensure safety and immediate error capture.

* **The Limitation:** Do not use `Purely` to process infinite generators or massive datasets that don't fit in memory.
* **The Workaround:** For high-volume data processing, stick to native Python generators, `itertools`, or specialized libraries like `pandas`.

### 2. Performance Overhead

To provide fluency and safety, **Purely** creates wrapper objects (`Chain`, `Option`) for every operation.

* **The Limitation:** In tight inner loops (e.g., image processing pixels, game engines), this object allocation adds significant overhead compared to raw `if/else` or native list comprehensions.
* **The Workaround:** Use **Purely** for high-level business logic, API orchestration, and data transformation steps where readability is key. Drop down to native Python for performance-critical hot paths.

### 3. "Railway" Error Handling

`Chain` captures exceptions to prevent crashes, storing them until you explicitly check for them.

* **The Limitation:** If you create a chain but forget to call `.unwrap()`, `.test()`, or `.catch()`, exceptions (like `ZeroDivisionError`) will be swallowed silently, and the program will continue in a "failed" state without alerting you.
* **The Workaround:** Always terminate your chains. If a chain is used solely for side effects, end it with `.test()` to assert success.

### 4. Debugging Proxies

The `safe()` utility uses dynamic proxies (`__getattr__` hooks) to achieve its magic.

* **The Limitation:** Debuggers may step into internal proxy code rather than your business logic, and some static analysis tools (mypy/pylint) might struggle to infer types through complex `safe()` calls without explicit hints.
* **The Workaround:** If you run into complex type errors, use `ensure()` early to unwrap values back into standard Python types that IDEs understand perfectly.

### 5. Limited Vocabulary

**Purely** is not a full replacement for `toolz` or Haskell.

* **The Limitation:** It intentionally lacks complex functional primitives like `reduce`, `flat_map`, or `compose` to keep the API surface small and approachable.
* **The Workaround:** If you need advanced functional patterns, **Purely** might be too simple for you. It plays nicely with standard Python, so you can mix it with standard libraries as needed.
