Defines methods to save and load
:class:`~physioblocks.configuration.base.Configuration` objects to a json file

.. note::

    It is possible to save and load ``.jsonc`` files and use ``//`` characters to
    comment the file.

    The comments are discarded when the file is loaded: there are only here to increase
    the json readability.
