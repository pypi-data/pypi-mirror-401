In this chapter will learn how to write new **Blocks** and **ModelComponents**.

First, we will present how to install optional tools to test the source code.
We will then present the PhysioBlocks objects and main concepts for writing **Fluxes**, **Internal Equations** and **Saved Quantities**.
We will then use the :class:`~physioblocks.library.blocks.capacitances.RCRBlock` implemented in the PhysioBlocks library to provide an example for each object.
Finally, we will see how to make the block available for use in **Nets and Simulation Configurations**.
