In this chapter we will learn how to write **JSON configuration files** that can be used with the **PhysioBlocks Launcher**.

We will first look at **PhysioBlocks main objects** and how it is **assembling global system**.
We will then see how to write a JSON describing a **Net** and use it to create a **full simulation configuration**.
Finally, we will see how to **simplify configuration files** using configuration **Aliases**.
