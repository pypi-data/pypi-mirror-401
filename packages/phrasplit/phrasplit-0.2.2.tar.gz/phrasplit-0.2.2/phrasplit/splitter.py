"""Text splitting utilities using spaCy for NLP-based sentence and clause detection.

This module provides two implementations:
1. spaCy-based (default when available): High accuracy, handles complex cases
2. Regex-based (fallback): Faster, simpler, good for common cases

The implementation is selected automatically based on spaCy availability,
