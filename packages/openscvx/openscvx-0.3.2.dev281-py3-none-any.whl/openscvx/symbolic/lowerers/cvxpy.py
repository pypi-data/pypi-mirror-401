"""CVXPy backend for lowering symbolic expressions to CVXPy format.

This module implements the CVXPy lowering backend that converts symbolic expression
AST nodes into CVXPy expressions for convex optimization. The lowering uses a visitor
pattern where each expression type has a corresponding visitor method.

Architecture:
    The CVXPy lowerer follows a visitor pattern with centralized registration:

    1. **Visitor Registration**: The @visitor decorator registers handler functions
       for each expression type in the _CVXPY_VISITORS dictionary
    2. **Dispatch**: The dispatch() function looks up and calls the appropriate
       visitor based on the expression's type
    3. **Recursive Lowering**: Each visitor recursively lowers child expressions
       and composes CVXPy operations
    4. **Translation Only**: This module only translates expressions; CVXPy itself
       validates DCP (Disciplined Convex Programming) rules when the problem is
       constructed/solved

Key Features:
    - **Expression Translation**: Converts symbolic AST to CVXPy expression format
    - **Variable Management**: Maps symbolic States/Controls to CVXPy variables
      through a variable_map dictionary
    - **Parameter Support**: Handles both constant parameters and CVXPy Parameters
      for efficient parameter sweeps
    - **Constraint Generation**: Produces CVXPy constraint objects from symbolic
      equality and inequality expressions

Backend Usage:
    CVXPy lowering is used for convex constraints in the SCP subproblem. Unlike
    JAX lowering (which happens early during problem construction), CVXPy lowering
    occurs later during Problem.initialize() when CVXPy variables are
    available. See lower_symbolic_expressions() in symbolic/lower.py for details.

CVXPy Variable Mapping:
    The lowerer requires a variable_map dictionary that maps symbolic variable names
    to CVXPy expressions. For trajectory optimization::

        variable_map = {
            "x": cvxpy.Variable((n_x,)),  # State vector
            "u": cvxpy.Variable((n_u,)),  # Control vector
            "param_name": cvxpy.Parameter((3,)),  # Runtime parameters
        }

    States and Controls use their slices (assigned during unification) to extract
    the correct portion of the unified x and u vectors.

Example:
    Basic usage::

        import cvxpy as cp
        from openscvx.symbolic.lowerers.cvxpy import CvxpyLowerer
        import openscvx as ox

        # Create symbolic expression
        x = ox.State("x", shape=(3,))
        u = ox.Control("u", shape=(2,))
        expr = ox.Norm(x)**2 + 0.1 * ox.Norm(u)**2

        # Create CVXPy variables
        cvx_x = cp.Variable(3)
        cvx_u = cp.Variable(2)

        # Lower to CVXPy
        lowerer = CvxpyLowerer(variable_map={"x": cvx_x, "u": cvx_u})
        cvx_expr = lowerer.lower(expr)

        # Use in optimization problem
        prob = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(cvx_expr), constraints=[...])
        prob.solve()

    Constraint lowering::

        # Symbolic constraint
        constraint = ox.Norm(x) <= 1.0

        # Lower to CVXPy constraint
        cvx_constraint = lowerer.lower(constraint)

        # Add to problem
        prob = cp.Problem(cp.Minimize(cost), constraints=[cvx_constraint])

For Contributors:
    **Adding Support for New Expression Types**

    To add support for a new symbolic expression type to CVXPy lowering:

    1. **Define the visitor method** in CvxpyLowerer with the @visitor decorator::

        @visitor(MyNewExpr)
        def _visit_my_new_expr(self, node: MyNewExpr) -> cp.Expression:
            # Lower child expressions recursively
            operand = self.lower(node.operand)

            # Return CVXPy expression
            return cp.my_operation(operand)

    2. **Key requirements**:
        - Use the @visitor(ExprType) decorator to register the handler
        - Method name should be _visit_<expr_name> (private, lowercase, snake_case)
        - Recursively lower all child expressions using self.lower()
        - Return a cp.Expression or cp.Constraint object
        - Use cp.* operations for CVXPy atoms

    3. **DCP considerations**:
        - This module only translates; CVXPy validates DCP rules
        - Document the mathematical properties in the docstring (convex, concave, affine)
        - For non-DCP operations, raise NotImplementedError with helpful message
        - See _visit_sin, _visit_cos, _visit_ctcs for examples

    4. **Example patterns**:
        - Unary operation: ``return cp.my_func(self.lower(node.operand))``
        - Binary operation: ``return self.lower(node.left) + self.lower(node.right)``
        - Constraints: ``return self.lower(node.lhs) <= self.lower(node.rhs)``
        - Not supported: Raise NotImplementedError with guidance

    5. **Testing**: Ensure your visitor works with:
        - Simple expressions: Direct lowering to cp.Expression
        - Constraint validation: CVXPy accepts the result
        - DCP checking: CVXPy's problem.solve() validates correctly

    The lowering process is recursive: each visitor lowers its child expressions

    (Disciplined Convex Programming) compliance when the problem is constructed.
