    Configuration class for PreOCR thresholds and settings.
    
    This class allows customization of decision thresholds for OCR detection.
    All thresholds are optional and default to optimized values for general use.
    
    Attributes:
        min_text_length: Minimum text length to consider a file as having meaningful text.
                        Files with less text will be flagged as needing OCR.
                        Default: 50 characters.
        
        min_office_text_length: Minimum text length for office documents to skip OCR.
                               Office documents with less text will be flagged as needing OCR.
                               Default: 100 characters.
        
        layout_refinement_threshold: Confidence threshold for triggering OpenCV layout analysis.
                                    If initial confidence is below this, use OpenCV for refinement.
                                    Default: 0.9 (90%).
        
        high_confidence: Threshold for high confidence decisions. Default: 0.9.
        
        medium_confidence: Threshold for medium confidence decisions. Default: 0.7.
        
        low_confidence: Threshold for low confidence decisions. Default: 0.5.
    
    Example:
        >>> # Use default thresholds
        >>> config = Config()
        >>> 
        >>> # Customize thresholds for stricter detection
