# pdflinkcheck

A purpose-built tool for comprehensive analysis of hyperlinks and GoTo links within PDF documents. Users may leverage either the PyMuPDF or the pypdf library. Use the CLI or the GUI.

## 📥 Access and Installation

The recommended way to use `pdflinkcheck` is to either install the CLI with `pipx` or to download the appropriate latest binary for your system from [Releases](https://github.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/pdflinkcheck/releases/).

### 🚀 Release Artifact Files (EXE, PYZ, ELF)

For the most user-typical experience, download the single-file binary matching your OS.

| **File Type** | **Primary Use Case** | **Recommended Launch Method** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Executable (.exe, .elf)** | **GUI** | Double-click the file. |
| **PYZ (Python Zip App)** | **CLI** or **GUI** | Run using your system's `python` command: `python pdflinkcheck-VERSION.pyz --help` | 

### Installation via pipx

For an isolated environment where you can access `pdflinkcheck` from any terminal:

```bash
# Ensure you have pipx installed first (if not, run: pip install pipx)
pipx install pdflinkcheck[full]

# On Termux
pipx install pdflinkcheck

```

-----

## 💻 Graphical User Interface (GUI)

The tool can be run as simple cross-platform graphical interface (Tkinter).

### Launching the GUI

Ways to launch the GUI interface:
1.  **Implicit Launch:** Run the tool or file with no arguments, subcommands, or flags. (Note: PyInstaller builds use the --windowed (or -noconsole) flag, except for on Termux.)
2.  **Explicit Command:** Use the dedicated GUI subcommand (`pdflinkcheck gui`).

-----

## 🚀 CLI Usage

The core functionality is accessed via the `analyze` command. 

`pdflinkcheck --help`:

See the Help Tree by unlocking the help-tree CLI command, using the DEV_TYPER_HELP_TREE env var.

```
DEV_TYPER_HELP_TREE=1 pdflinkcheck help-tree` # bash
$env:DEV_TYPER_HELP_TREE = "1"; pdflinkcheck help-tree` # PowerShell
```

## 📦 Library Access (Advanced)

For developers importing `pdflinkcheck` into other Python projects, the core analysis functions are exposed directly in the root namespace. The various `analysis_pdf_*` functions each use a different library to extract the target PDF's internal TOC, external links, and metadata.

|**Function**|**Library**|**Description**|
|---|---|---|
|`run_report()`|pdflinkcheck | **(Primary function)** Performs the full analysis, prints to console, and handles file export.|
|`analyze_pdf_pdfium()`| pypdfium2 | Fast, ~10 mb, Permissively licensed |
|`analyze_pdf_pymupdf()`| PyMuPDF | Fast, ~30 mb, AGPL3+ licensed |
|`analyze_pdf_pypdf()`| pypdf library | Slow, ~2 mb, Permissively licensed |

Exanple:

```python
from pdflinkcheck import ( run_report,
                          analyze_pdf_pymupdf, 
                          analyze_pdf_pypdf, 
                          analyze_pdf_pdfium, 
                          )

file = "document1.pdf"
report_data = run_report(file)
links_pdfium = analyze_pdf_pdfium(file)
links_pypdf = analyze_pdf_pypdf(file)
```

-----

## ✨ Features

  * **Active Link Extraction:** Identifies and categorizes all programmed links (External URIs, Internal GoTo/Destinations, Remote Jumps).
  * **Anchor Text Retrieval:** Extracts the visible text corresponding to each link's bounding box.
  * **Structural TOC:** Extracts the PDF's internal Table of Contents (bookmarks/outline).

## 🥚 Optional REPL‑Friendly GUI Access (Easter Egg)

For users who prefer exploring tools interactively—especially those coming from MATLAB or other REPL‑first environments—`pdflinkcheck` includes an optional Easter egg that exposes the GUI launcher directly in the library namespace.

This feature is **disabled by default** and has **no effect on normal imports**.

### Enabling the Easter Egg

Set the environment variable before importing the library:

```python
import os
os.environ["PDFLINKCHECK_GUI_EASTEREGG"] = "true"

import pdflinkcheck
pdflinkcheck.start_gui()
```

Accepted values include: `true`, `1`, `yes`, `on` (case‑insensitive).

### Purpose

This opt‑in behavior is designed to make the library feel welcoming to beginners who are experimenting in a Python REPL for the first time. When enabled, the `start_gui()` function becomes available at the top level:

```python
pdflinkcheck.start_gui()
```

If the `PDFLINKCHECK_GUI_EASTEREGG` environment variable is not set—or if GUI support is unavailable—`pdflinkcheck` behaves as a normal library with no GUI functions exposed.

### Another Easter Egg

```bash
DEV_TYPER_HELP_TREE=1 pdflinkcheck help-tree
```

This `help-tree` feature has not yet been submitted for inclusion into Typer.

## ⚠️ Compatibility Notes

### Termux Compatibility as a Key Goal
A key goal of City-of-Memphis-Wastewater is to release all software as Termux-compatible.

Termux compatibility is important in the modern age, because Android devices are common among technicians, field engineers, and maintenace staff. 
Android is the most common operating system in the Global South. 
We aim to produce stable software that can do the most possible good. 

Now `pdflinkcheck` can run on Termux by using the `pypdf` engine and the `pdfium` engine. 
Benefits:
- `pypdf`-only artifacts, to reduce size to about 6% compared to artifacts that include `PyMuPDF`.
- Web-stack GUI as an alternative to the Tkinter GUI, which can be run locally on Termux or as a web app.


### PDF Library Selection
At long last, `PyMuPDF` is an optional dependency. All testing comparing `pypdf` and `PyMuPDF` has shown identical validation performance. However `PyMuPDF` is much faster. The benfit of `pypdf` is small size of packages and cross-platform compatibility. We have recently added a PDFium option, which circumvents the AGPL3+.

Expecte that all binaries and artifacts contain PyMuPDF, unlss they are built on Android. The GUI and CLI interfaces both allow selection of the library; if PyMuPDF is selected but is not available, the user will be warned.

To install the complete version use one of these options:

```bash
pip install "pdflinkcheck[pymupdf]"
pipx install "pdflinkcheck[pdfium]"
uv tool install "pdflinkcheck[pdfium]"
uv add "pdflinkcheck[pdfium]"
```

---

### Document Compatibility: 
Not all PDF files can be processed successfully. This tool is designed primarily for digitally generated (vector-based) PDFs.

Processing may fail or yield incomplete results for:
* **Scanned PDFs** (images of text) that lack an accessible text layer.
* **Encrypted or Password-Protected** documents.
* **Malformed or non-standard** PDF files.

-----

## Run from Source (Developers)

```bash
git clone http://github.com/city-of-memphis-wastewater/pdflinkcheck.git
cd pdflinkcheck

# To include the PyMuPDF dependency in the installation:
uv sync --extras pdfium --extra pymupdf

# On Termux, to not include PyMuPDF:
uv sync --extra pdfium

# To include developer dependencies:
uv sync --all-extras --group dev

# Run the CLI
uv run python src/pdflinkcheck/cli.py --help

# Run a basic webapp and Termux-facing browser-based interface
uv run  python -m pdflinkcheck.stdlib_server
```

## 📜 License Implications (AGPLv3+)


The `AGPL3-or-later` is required for binaries of `pdflinkcheck` which include `PyMuPDF`, which is licensed under the `AGPL3`.
The source code itself for `pdflinkcheck` is licensed under the `MIT`. 

The AGPL3-or-later license has significant implications for **distribution and network use**, particularly for organizations:

  * **Source Code Provision:** If you distribute this tool (modified or unmodified) to anyone, you **must** provide the full source code under the same license.
  * **Network Interaction (Affero Clause):** If you modify this tool and make the modified version available to users over a computer network (e.g., as a web service or backend), you **must** also offer the source code to those network users.

> **Before deploying or modifying this tool for organizational use, especially for internal web services or distribution, please ensure compliance with the AGPLv3+ terms.**

Because the AGPLv3 is a strong copyleft license, any version of `pdflinkcheck` that includes AGPL‑licensed components (such as `PyMuPDF`) must be distributed as a whole under AGPLv3+. This means that for those versions, anyone who distributes the application — or makes a modified version available over a network — must also provide the complete corresponding source code under the same terms.

The source code of pdflinkcheck itself remains licensed under the **MIT License**; only the distributed binary becomes AGPL‑licensed when PyMuPDF is included.
