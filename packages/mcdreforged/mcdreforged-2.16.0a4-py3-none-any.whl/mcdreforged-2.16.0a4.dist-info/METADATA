> This is a python based Minecraft server control tool

MCDReforged (abbreviated as MCDR) is a tool which provides the management ability of the Minecraft server using custom plugin system. It doesn't need to modify or mod the original Minecraft server at all

From in-game calculator, player high-light, to manipulate scoreboard, manage structure file and backup / load backup, you can implement these by using MCDR and related plugins

Greatly thanks to chino_desu and his [MCDaemon 1.0](https://github.com/kafuuchino-desu/MCDaemon) for the idea of such a cool Minecraft control tool

## Advantage

- It's running above the server. It doesn't need to modify the server at all which keep everything vanilla
- Hot-reloadable plugin system. You don't need to shut down the server to update the plugins
- Multi-platform / server compatibility. Supports vanilla, paper, bungeecord etc. on Linux / Windows

## How it works?

MCDR uses [Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.Popen) to start the server as a sub-process, 
then it has the ability to control the standard input / out stream of the server

Since the console output of a Minecraft server has a stable format and contains a large amount of useful information about the server, 
e.g. player chat messages, MCDR is able to parse and analyze the server output, abstract them into different events and dispatch them towards plugins for responding

With the help of Minecraft command system, MCDR can send Minecraft commands via the standard input stream to affect the actual Minecraft server

That's it, you can even think of MCDR as a robot that stares at the server console and can quickly respond to server output and input related commands if you like 

## Plugin
