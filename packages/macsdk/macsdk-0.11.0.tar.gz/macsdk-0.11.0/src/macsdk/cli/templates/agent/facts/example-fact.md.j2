# Example Fact

This is an example fact that demonstrates how to structure contextual information and reference data.

## Purpose

Facts provide accurate background information that the agent needs to work correctly. Unlike skills (which explain *how* to do things), facts explain *what* things are.

## Example Information

### Service Names

- **{{ name }}**: The main service for this agent
- **api-gateway**: Entry point for all requests
- **database**: PostgreSQL instance on port 5432

### Configuration Values

- Default timeout: 30 seconds
- Max retries: 3
- Rate limit: 100 requests/minute

### Important URLs

- Production API: https://api.example.com
- Staging API: https://staging-api.example.com
- Documentation: https://docs.example.com

## How to Use

1. The available facts are listed in the system prompt
2. Use `read_fact(path)` to get specific details
3. Reference facts when you need accurate names, IDs, or configurations

## Guidelines

- Facts should contain **accurate, up-to-date information**
- Update facts when configurations change
- Keep facts concise and well-organized
- Use clear headings and formatting

## Notes

Replace this example with your own domain-specific information:
- Service names and endpoints
- Configuration settings
- Policy rules
- Team contacts
- Common identifiers
- Business-specific terminology
