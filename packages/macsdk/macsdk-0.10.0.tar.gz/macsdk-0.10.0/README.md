# MACSDK - Multi-Agent Chatbot SDK

A comprehensive SDK for building customizable multi-agent chatbots with RAG support, web interfaces, and reusable API tools.

## What can it do?

- Create a **chatbot** with CLI and Web UI, ready to be used immediately.
- Create **agents** with a CLI chat (for testing purposes) ready to be used.
- **Register agents** into chatbots, so your chatbot can call any of the agents you add.

## How does it work?

The chatbot has a **"supervisor"** agent that knows about the registered agents and decides when to use one or another. It uses them as tools.

## Key Features

- **🏗️ Scaffolding CLI**: Generate chatbot and agent projects with a single command.
- **🤖 Intelligent Supervisor**: Automatic routing and orchestration of specialist agents.
- **📚 RAG Support**: Enable RAG when creating a chatbot to pull docs from URLs (HTML/Markdown) or local files.
- **🧠 Context Management**: Keeps user queries and final answers in context, auto-compressing messages if the history gets too large.
- **🌐 Web Interface**: Built-in FastAPI + WebSocket server with real-time streaming (compatible with other WebSocket UIs).
- **⏱️ Time Awareness**: Injects current time into prompts so agents are aware of the "now" (useful for logs/APIs).
- **🔧 Built-in Tools**: Ready-to-use tools for REST APIs (with JSONPath extraction) and file downloads.
- **🔄 Progress Tracking**: Shows real-time progress when an agent is selected and which tools are being used.

## Quick Start

### Installation

For detailed installation instructions, see the [Installation Guide](docs/getting-started/installation.md).

```bash
# Clone and install
git clone https://github.com/juanje/macsdk
cd macsdk
uv sync

# Or install via pip/uv (once published)
# uv add macsdk
```

### 1. Create a Chatbot

Learn more in the [Creating Chatbots Guide](docs/guides/creating-chatbots.md).

```bash
macsdk new chatbot my-chatbot --display-name "My First Chatbot"
cd my-chatbot
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env and add your GOOGLE_API_KEY
uv sync
uv run my-chatbot
```
*It's ready to use immediately.*

### 2. Create an Agent

Learn more in the [Creating Agents Guide](docs/guides/creating-agents.md).

```bash
cd ..
macsdk new agent infra-agent --description "Monitors infrastructure services"
cd infra-agent
uv sync
uv run infra-agent chat
```
*It has its own chat for testing.*

### 3. Register the Agent to the Chatbot

```bash
cd ../my-chatbot/
macsdk add-agent . --path ../infra-agent
```

Now you'll be able to use the chat, which can delegate to the agent if needed.

```bash
uv run my-chatbot chat
# Or using the Web UI
uv run my-chatbot web
```

You can add as many agents as you want!

## Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)

```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### YAML Configuration (config.yml)

```yaml
# LLM settings
llm_model: gemini-3-flash-preview
llm_temperature: 0.3

# RAG sources (if --with-rag)

  enabled: true
  sources:
    - name: "My Docs"
      url: "https://docs.example.com/"
      tags: ["docs", "api"]
```

## Examples

The `examples/` directory contains working examples:

- **api-agent**: REST API interactions with JSONPlaceholder.
- **devops-chatbot**: Multi-agent chatbot with RAG and API tools.
