def discounted_returns(
    rewards: list[float], terminated: list[bool], discount: float = 1.0
) -> list[float]:
    r"""
    Calculate the discounted returns for a list of rewards, considering termination flags and a discount factor.

    The discounted return represents the future discounted rewards from each time step onwards, taking into account
    whether an episode has terminated at each step.

    The discounted return \( G_t \) is given by:

    .. math::
        G_t = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \gamma^{k-1} R_{t+k}

        where:
        - \( G_t \) is the discounted return starting from time step \( t \).
        - \( \gamma \) is the discount factor.
        - \( R_{t+k} \) is the reward received at time step \( t+k \).

    NOTE: this could live in ldp.alg, but it's here to avoid circular imports.

    Args:
        rewards: A list of rewards at each time step.
        terminated: A list of boolean flags indicating whether the episode terminated at each time step.
        discount: Discount factor to apply to future rewards. Defaults to 1.0 which means no discounting is applied.

    Returns:
        A list of discounted returns (rewards to go), with each element representing the
            total discounted reward from that step onwards.

    Example:
        >>> rewards = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0]
        >>> terminated = [False, False, True]
        >>> discounted_returns(rewards, terminated, discount=0.9)
