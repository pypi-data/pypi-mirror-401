    This class manages the lifecycle of a file in the context of real-time collaboration,
    handling:
    - Loading file content from Jupyter Server's ContentsManager into a YDoc
    - Saving YDoc changes back to the filesystem with adaptive timing
    - Detecting and responding to in-band and out-of-band file changes
    - Managing notebook outputs through the OutputsManager

    Usage:
        1. Create instance with parent YRoom: `file_api = YRoomFileAPI(parent=yroom)`
        2. Load content: `file_api.load_content_into(jupyter_ydoc)`
        3. Wait for loading: `await file_api.until_content_loaded`
        4. Schedule saves: `file_api.schedule_save()` (saves happen automatically)
        5. Stop gracefully: `file_api.stop()`

    The class uses adaptive timing to optimize save intervals based on save duration,
    preventing performance degradation with large files while maintaining responsiveness
    for small files.

    Attributes:
        parent: The parent YRoom instance (set by LoggingConfigurable).
        file_format: The format of the file ('text' or 'base64').
        file_type: The type of the file ('file' or 'notebook').
        file_id: The unique identifier for this file.
