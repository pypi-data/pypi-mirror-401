CloudVision allows users to version control provisioning operations
that impact device configuration and image management. A workspace is
something like a git branch, within which changes can be made without
immediately impacting a device's running configuration. Changes can be
made, modified, and previewed in a workspace. Once satisfied with the
set of changes, a user may submit a workspace to the "mainline" branch,
allowing the changes to be propagated to devices via Change Controls.

A workspace comprises a set of diff operations (e.g., add/modify/remove)
that will be applied to the mainline if the workspace is submitted
successfully.

A workspace itself is generic and can be used for any conceivable
set of device provisioning operations, but it is not capable of
describing the specific kind of changes. Rather, it holds changes
defined by other Resource APIs that are "workspace-aware", such as
studio.v1 and tag.v2. These APIs allow users to make changes within
the context of a specific workspace, identified in the resource key
with the field `workspace_id`.
