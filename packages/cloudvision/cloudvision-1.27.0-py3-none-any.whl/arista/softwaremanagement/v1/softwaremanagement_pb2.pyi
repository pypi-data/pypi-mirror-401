EOS images, Streaming Agent, and other extensions in CloudVision are managed using this
resource API. Images and extensions can be added, deleted and updated.

New software is added to CloudVision either by uploading files directly from your computer using
the Software Upload REST API or by downloading them from Arista's Software Download site using
this resource API. To upload software using the Software Upload REST API in CloudVision, navigate
to Settings > Developer Tools > REST API Explorer > softwareRepository.

No matter how the image or extension is added, you can use the resource API to update or delete
it.

    Adding Software to CloudVision:

    When a `Set` is made, the software identified by the URI will be downloaded from Arista's
    Software Download site and stored in CloudVision. The status of the software will be reflected
    by a corresponding `Repository` entry identified by the same `RepositoryKey`.

    Here is an example where a .swi EOS image is added to CloudVision:

    ```
    {
     "value": {
       "key": {
         "name": "EOS64-4.30.0.1F.swi"
       },
       "uri": "/support/download/EOS-USA/Active Releases/4.30/EOS-4.30.0.1F/EOS64-4.30.0.1F.swi",
       "rebootRequired": true
     },
    }
    ```

    The following is an example of a configuration that will add the
    _AristaAppForSplunk-2.0.1-4.27.swix_ extension to CloudVision:

    ```
    {
     "value": {
       "key": {
         "name": "AristaAppForSplunk-2.0.1-4.27.swix"
       },
       "uri": "/support/download/Extensions/Splunk/AristaAppForSplunk-2.0.1-4.27.swix",
       "rebootRequired": false
     },
    }
    ```

    Updating Existing Software:

    `Repository` metadata objects can be _updated_ by using the config `Set` method and
    specifying the field or fields to be modified. Currently, `reboot_required` is the only field
    that can be modified after software has been added to CloudVision. All other fields must match
    the existing configuration, or can be omitted.

    NOTE: The `reboot_required` field must be `true` for .swi images.

    In this example, we update the `reboot_required` field changing it from `false` to `true`
    while leaving out the uri field:

    ```
    {
     "value": {
       "key": {
         "name": "AristaAppForSplunk-2.0.1-4.27.swix"
       },
       "rebootRequired": true
     },
    }
    ```

    Deleting Software:

    `Repository` objects can be deleted using the `RepositoryConfig` `Delete` method.
    A `Delete` request will specify the `key` which uniquely identifies the image or extension in
    CloudVision. For example, a delete request will look like the following:
    ```
    {
     "value": {
       "key": {
         "name": "AristaAppForSplunk-2.0.1-4.27.swix"
       },
     },
    }
    ```
