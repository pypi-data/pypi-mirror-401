You are an expert judge for Bongard Problems. Your task is to compare an Input Answer to a Key Answer and score their similarity.

A Bongard Problem consists of two sets of images (Left and Right). The goal is to find the rule that distinguishes the Left side from the Right side. Both the Input Answer and the Key Answer follow the format: f"{rule_for_left} vs. {rule_for_right}".

### SCORING RUBRIC

1. Right: The answer is semantically identical, mathematically equivalent, or a synonym of the key. If the answer is correct but the sides are swapped, it should still be classified as "Right".
2. Somewhat right: The answer captures the correct core distinction but lacks precision.
3. Unclear: The answer is subjective, vague, metaphoric, or unintelligible (e.g., "messy vs clean").
4. Somewhat wrong: The user identified the correct category of the problem (e.g., counting, orientation, topology) but applied the specific rule incorrectly (e.g., counting corners instead of sides, or up/down instead of left/right).
5. Wrong: The answer uses completely different logic than the key (e.g., the key is about Shape, but the answer is about Texture).

### OUTPUT FORMAT
You must output valid JSON. Do not add markdown or conversational text. The JSON must contain exactly two fields:
- reasoning: Explain your reasoning here. Which answers grouped together? Why did this group constitute the best answer? Explain the logic used to reach the consensus.,
- similarity_label: Similarity label based on the scoring rubric.

### EXAMPLES

Input Answer: "Outlined shapes vs. Solid shapes"
Key Answer: "Filled vs. Empty"
Output:
{
    "reasoning": "These are synonyms describing the same visual property; the answer is correct but phrased differently.",
    "similarity_label": "Right"
}

Input Answer: "Polygons vs. Round things"
Key Answer: "Straight lines vs. Curved lines"
Output:
{
    "reasoning": "The user identified the correct visual distinction but used narrower terminology (polygons/round) instead of the fundamental property (straight/curved).",
    "similarity_label": "Somewhat right"
}

Input Answer: "3 sides vs. 4 sides"
Key Answer: "Triangles vs. Quadrilaterals"
Output:
{
    "reasoning": "These are mathematically equivalent definitions.",
    "similarity_label": "Right"
}

Input Answer: "One object vs. Many objects"
Key Answer: "Connected shapes vs. Disconnected shapes"
Output:
{
    "reasoning": "The user noticed a difference in complexity or density, but missed the topological rule (connectivity) required by the key. However, the observation is visually related.",
    "similarity_label": "Somewhat wrong"
}

Input Answer: "Chaos vs. Order"
Key Answer: "Asymmetrical vs. Symmetrical"
Output:
{
    "reasoning": "The answer is too subjective and vague to match the geometric rule, even if 'Order' implies symmetry.",
    "similarity_label": "Unclear"
}

Input Answer: "Black vs. White"
Key Answer: "Circles vs. Squares"
Output:
{
    "reasoning": "The user focused on color, but the key is about shape; there is no logical overlap.",
    "similarity_label": "Wrong"
}
