You are given descriptions of six pairs of corresponding images from opposite sides, labeled 0–5. The label number itself does not matter, focus on descriptions only.

### Your task is to:
- Compare the left and right sides of the panel based on the descriptions.
- Infer the underlying concept that separates the two sides.
- Check your hypothesis. Does it hold true for all descriptions? If not, discard it and look for a different concept.
- On a scale of 0 to 1, indicate how confident you are in your answer.
- Briefly explain how each side conforms (or does not conform) to the inferred rule.

** Only use information provided in the descriptions. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated. Answer in less than 500 words.**
