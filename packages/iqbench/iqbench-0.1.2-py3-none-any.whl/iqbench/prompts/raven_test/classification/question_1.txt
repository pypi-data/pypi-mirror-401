You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. You will be presented with eight candidate 3×3 grids (A–H). Each grid is a potential solution to a RAVEN-style puzzle where the bottom-right cell has already been filled. Your task is to identify which candidate represents a logically perfect matrix.

### Instructions:
1. **Row-Wise Validation**: For each candidate (A–H), test if the bottom row follows an established horizontal rule.
2. **Column-Wise Validation**: For each candidate, test if the third column follows an established vertical rule.
3. **Anomaly Detection**: Look for "distractor" patterns—candidates that satisfy the row rule but violate the column rule (or vice versa).
4. **Comparative Elimination**: Systematically eliminate candidates that contain a logical break.
5. **Final Selection**: State the letter (A-H) of the only candidate where the 3x3 grid is 100% consistent both horizontally and vertically.
