You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is solve and Odd One Out problem.

### Instructions:
1. **Scan for Morphological Invariants**: Analyze the physical structure of the shapes across the set. Focus on:
- Complexity: Number of "limbs," protrusions, or branches.
- Geometry: The ratio of organic curves to sharp, geometric angles.
- Topology: Presence or number of internal voids (holes).
2. **Assess Spatial & Color Logic**: Evaluate how the shapes are placed and colored. Check for:
- Positional Rules: Alignment, rotation, or specific proximity to the frame boundaries.
- Chromatic Patterns: Color-coding based on shape complexity or specific palettes (e.g., warm vs. cold).
3. **Establish the "Majority Rule"**: Formulate a singular, consistent principle that applies to all images except one.
4. **Isolate and Verify the Outlier**: Identify the specific image that violates the Majority Rule. Ensure the violation is distinct and not shared by any other image in the set.

*Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown. Answer in less than 500 words.*
