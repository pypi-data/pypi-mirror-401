This puzzle is an odd one out problem. The goal is to identify which element doesn’t fit a shared visual rule. Most items follow the same pattern or relationship (in shape, color, size, position, orientation etc.), while one item violates that rule. 
The task is to infer the underlying pattern and find the element that breaks it.
