You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. You are presented with four sets of images (A, B, C, and D), each with one image blacked out. 
Your task is to determine which set fails to maintain the "Odd One Out" logic.

### Instructions:
Identify which blackout set (A, B, C, or D) fails to establish a valid 'Odd One Out' logic defined as a set where a clear majority rule is absent or a single, visible outlier cannot be discerned.

*Only use information provided in the images. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated. Answer in less than 500 words.*
