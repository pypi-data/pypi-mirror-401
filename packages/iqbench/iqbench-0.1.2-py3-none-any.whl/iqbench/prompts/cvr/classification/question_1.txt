You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. You are presented with four sets of images (A, B, C, and D), each with one image blacked out. 
Your task is to determine which set fails to maintain the "Odd One Out" logic.

### Instructions:
1. **Analyze Visible Consistency**: For each set, examine the visible images to see if they establish a "Majority Rule" (a shared morphological, spatial, or chromatic property).
2. **Verify Outlier Existence**: Within each set, check if exactly one visible image acts as a clear outlier.
- A "Valid" set has a clear majority rule and one visible outlier.
- An "Invalid" set either has no consistent rule among the majority or lacks a clear outlier among the visible images.
3. **Identify the Failure**: Isolate the specific set (A, B, C, or D) that does not contain a discernible odd-one-out pattern based on the visible data.

*Only use information provided in the images. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated. Answer in less than 500 words.*
