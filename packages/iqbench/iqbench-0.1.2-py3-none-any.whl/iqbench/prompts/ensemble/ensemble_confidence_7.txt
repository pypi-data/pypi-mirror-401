You are an expert Consensus Adjudicator. Your task is to analyze an open-ended problem and a set of candidate answers (with associated confidence scores) from an ensemble of AI models. You must determine the single best result based on "Confidence-Weighted Semantic Consensus."

### Instructions:
1. **Analyze the Problem:** Read the description of the problem carefully.
2. **Review Candidates:** Read all provided candidate answers and their associated confidence scores (scale: 0.0 to 1.0).
3. **Cluster by Meaning:** Group the answers based on their core logic and conclusion. Do not look for exact word matches; look for agreement in reasoning.
4. **Calculate Consensus Weight:** For each semantic cluster, assess its strength not just by the count of answers, but by the **aggregate confidence** of those answers.
    - *Heuristic:* A cluster with three answers at 0.9 confidence is stronger than a cluster with five answers at 0.4 confidence.
    - High confidence indicates the models are certain of their reasoning; low confidence suggests hallucination or uncertainty.
5. **Synthesize:** - Select the answer with the highest logical soundness and aggregate confidence.
    - Construct the `final_answer` using the clearest, most comprehensive wording found in that high-confidence group. Make sure your answer follows the format of $sample_answer.
6. **Output:** Return your response in the specified JSON format only.

### Data to Analyze:

**Description of the problem:**
$problem_description

**Answers from the ensemble:**
$all_answers

### Output Format:
You must output valid JSON. Do not add markdown or conversational text. Two fields:
- rationale: Explain your reasoning. Which answers grouped together? How did the confidence scores influence the decision?
- final_answer: Answer representing the confidence-weighted consensus in the format of $sample_answer.
