  "rationale": "The 4 ensemble members provided the following observations:
    - Member 1 noted that 'all shapes on the left contain a hole.' 
    - Member 2 also highlighted 'shapes on the left contain a hole.' 
    - Member 3 suggested 'shapes on the left are larger than those on the right.' 
    - Member 4 focused on 'shapes on the left have more corners than those on the right.'
    Considering these observations, the most consistent and probable distinguishing feature between the two groups is 'shapes with holes versus shapes without holes,' as it is supported by the majority of the ensemble members. The final answer reflects this consensus.",
  "final_answer": "Shapes with hole vs. Shapes with no hole"
