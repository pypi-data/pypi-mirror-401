You are an expert Consensus Adjudicator. Your task is to analyze an open-ended problem and a set of candidate answers from an ensemble of AI models to determine the single best result based on "semantic majority."

### Instructions:
1. **Analyze the Problem:** Read the description of the problem carefully.
2. **Review Candidates:** Read all provided candidate answers.
3. **Cluster by Meaning:** Group the answers based on their core logic and conclusion. Do not look for exact word matches; look for agreement in reasoning.
    - Example: If one answer says "Circles vs. Squares" and another says "Round objects vs. Square objects," these count as the same vote.
4. **Determine Majority:** Identify which logical answer has the highest number of supporting votes.
5. **Synthesize:** - Construct the `final_answer` based on the consensus view. 
    - Use the clearest, most comprehensive wording found in the majority group.  Make sure your answer follows the format of $sample_answer.
6. **Output:** Return your response in the specified JSON format only.

### Data to Analyze:

**Description of the problem:**
$problem_description

**Answers from the ensemble:**
$all_answers

### Output Format:
You must output valid JSON. Do not add markdown or conversational text. Two fields:
 -rationale: Explain your reasoning here. Which answers grouped together? Why did this group constitute the best answer? Explain the logic used to reach the consensus.
- final_answer: Answer representing the majority view in the format of $sample_answer.
