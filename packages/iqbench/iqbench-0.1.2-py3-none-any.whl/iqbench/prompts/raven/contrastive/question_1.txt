You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to synthesize the provided textual description of the 3×3 grid with the visual candidate options (A–H) to identify the correct solution.

### Instructions:
1. **Requirement Extraction**: Extract the "Missing Cell Specification" from the provided text. List the mandatory attributes (morphology, orientation, chromatic properties, and relational dynamics) required for the blank (3,3) cell.
2. **Visual Validation**: Compare the specified "Relational Dynamics" (nesting, overlapping, or spatial alignment shifts) against the actual visual structure of options A–H.
3. **Contrastive Elimination**: Systematically evaluate each candidate. State the specific attribute or relational failure that disqualifies a candidate. Use the labels A–H for every comparison.
4. **Convergence Check**: Ensure the chosen candidate not only matches the "Missing Cell Specification" but also completes the "Horizontal and Vertical Deltas" described in the grid analysis.
5. **Final Selection**: Identify the single letter that represents a 100% match to the textual requirements and the visual logic.

*Only use information visible in the candidate images and provided in the grid description. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.
