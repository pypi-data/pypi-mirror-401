This puzzle is a visual pattern reasoning task. You are presented with a 3×3 grid of images where all but one image are provided. 
The images follow a systematic pattern or rule across rows, columns, or both, based on features such as shape, number, size, position, orientation, shading or other. The task is to identify the missing image (from a set of options) that correctly completes the pattern according to the inferred rule.
