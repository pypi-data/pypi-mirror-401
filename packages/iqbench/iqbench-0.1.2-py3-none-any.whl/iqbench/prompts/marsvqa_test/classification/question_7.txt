- On a scale of 0 to 1, indicate how confident you are in your answer.
- Explain briefly why the selected grid follows the pattern, and why the others do not.

** Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that are not explicitly shown.
Answer in less than 500 words.**
