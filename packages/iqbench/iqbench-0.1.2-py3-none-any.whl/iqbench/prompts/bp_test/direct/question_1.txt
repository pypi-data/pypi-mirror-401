You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to solve a Bongard Problem puzzle.

### Instructions:
1. **Extract Left-Side Invariants**: Identify one visual property shared by all six images on the **Left**. Check for:
- Elements: Types of shapes, lines, or points.
- Properties: Size, orientation, fill, or closure.
- Numbers: Count of items, vertices, or intersections.
- Relations: Containment, touching, alignment, or distance.
2. **Test Against Right-Side Counter-examples**: Verify that the identified property is absent or violated in every image on the **Right**.
3. **Refine at the Boundary**: Compare the images that look most similar across both sides. Isolate the specific visual detail that separates them to sharpen your rule.
4. **Finalize Rule**: Formulate a concise logic statement: "Left rule vs. Right rule"

*Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown. Answer in less than 500 words.*
