You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to identify the correct candidate (A–D) to complete a 3×3 MaRS matrix by synthesizing the visual question image with the provided textual descriptions of the candidate options.

### Instructions:
1. **Visual Rule Deduction**: Analyze the provided 3×3 grid image. Identify the transformational logic across the rows and down the columns.
2. **Missing Cell Specification**: Based on the visual grid, define the mandatory "Requirement Profile" for cell (3,3) specifying morphology, orientation, color/fill, and relational dynamics.
3. **Cross-Modal Mapping**: Match your "Requirement Profile" against the text descriptions provided for candidates A–D.
4. **Iterative Elimination**: Systematically evaluate why each candidate fails or succeeds. You must explicitly mention every label (A, B, C, D) at least once.

*Only use information provided in the image descriptions. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.
