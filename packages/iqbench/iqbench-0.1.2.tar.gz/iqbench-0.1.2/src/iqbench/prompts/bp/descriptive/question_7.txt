### Your task is to:
- Using the information provided in the image descriptions, compare the two groups of images and infer the underlying concept that separates them - applies to all images on the Left (descriptions 0-5), but not on the Right (descriptions 6-11).
- Check your hypothesis. Does it hold true for all 6 images on the Left? Does it fail for all 6 images on the Right? If not, discard it and look for a different concept.
- On a scale of 0 to 1, indicate how confident you are in your answer.
- Explain briefly how each side conforms (or does not conform) to it.
