You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to solve a Bongard Problem puzzle in a classification setting. (one of them has one pair of images from respective sides switched so the rules of the task are broken)

You are presented with two possible sets of images (A and B). 
### Instructions:
1. **Identify Potential Invariants**: Scan all images of the **Left** side in both sets. Look for a shared visual constant—such as a specific shape, a numerical value, or a spatial relationship.
2. **Test for Homogeneity (The 6/6 Rule)**: Apply your identified rule to all six images on the **Left** side of each option.
- The Correct Set: Every image on the **Left** will strictly obey the rule.
- The Broken Set: Five images will obey the rule, but one will be an outlier that clearly belongs on the **Right**.
3. **Analyze the Contrast (The 0/6 Rule)**: Check the **Right** side of both sets.
- The Correct Set: Every image on the Right will lack or contradict the Left rule.
- The Broken Set: One image on the Right will satisfy the Left rule (completing the "switched pair").
4. **Verify**: If both sets seem to have rules, choose the one where the rule is simpler and more direct. 

* Only use information provided in the images. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated. Answer in less than 500 words.*
