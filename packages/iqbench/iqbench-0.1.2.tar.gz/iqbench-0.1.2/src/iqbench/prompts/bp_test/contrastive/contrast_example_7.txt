### Output Format:
You must output valid JSON. Do not add markdown or conversational text. One field:
- **description**: Detailed description of differences between the two images. First one represents Left and second represents Right. Focus on differences in visible shapes, colors, orientations, and relations. Must use labels “Left” and  Right”  when referring to a certain image.
 
### Example:
{
    "description": "The **Left** image contains a small, stylized, outlined **triangle** shape, which appears to be pointing downwards and slightly to the left. The rest of the image is white space. The **Right** image contains a single, larger, **irregular, curved shape** that is also outlined in black. This shape has no sharp corners, is generally horizontal, and resembles a small, elongated blob or cloud. The shapes in Left and Right are fundamentally different: Left is a geometric shape (triangle), while Right is an organic/irregular shape. Both shapes are black outlines on a white background.",
