You are presented with a Bongard Problem consisting of twelve framed images arranged in two distinct sets: six images on the Left and six images on the Right.
There is a specific, precise visual rule or property that is true for every single image on the Left, but is false for every single image on the Right. 
The rule is never based on the order of the images within one side, only on their visual content.
The goal is to discover the underlying rule that distinguishes the two sides by analyzing patterns, relationships, and visual features such as shape, color, arrangement, or number.
