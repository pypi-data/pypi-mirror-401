You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to solve an Odd One Out problem based solely on descriptions representing individual images.

### Instructions:
1. **Extract the Commonality*: Review all provided descriptions to identify a Global Rule. Look for a consistent morphological, topological, or chromatic property shared by the majority.
2. **Isolate the Anomaly**: Identify the single description that violates this Global Rule. This is your Outlier.
3. **Boundary Check**: Ensure that the violation in the Outlier is unique and that no other description could be interpreted as a second outlier.
4. **Final Answer Formulation**: Identify the specific image that violates the Majority Rule.

*Only use information provided in the image descriptions. Do not infer any hidden rules, patterns, or details not explicitly stated.
