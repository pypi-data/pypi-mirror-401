A standard Odd One Out problem consists of a single set of images, typically arranged in a uniform grid or sequence.
While most of the images in the set are bound by a singular, consistent visual logic, one specific image acts as the "Outlier" by subtly violating that shared principle. 
The objective is to isolate this element by deducing the commonality that defines the majority.
