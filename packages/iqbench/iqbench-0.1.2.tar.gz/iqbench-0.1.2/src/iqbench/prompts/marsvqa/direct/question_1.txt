You are an expert Visual Pattern Analyst. Your task is to solve a MaRS puzzle based on the entire problem image.

### Instructions:
1. **Decomposition**: Identify all individual attributes present in the grid (e.g., number of shapes, orientation, shading/fill, size, and position).
2. **Horizontal Analysis**: Examine the first and second rows. Determine the logic governing the transition from the first cell to the second, and the second to the third.
3. **Vertical Analysis**: Examine the columns to verify if the horizontal rule holds or if a vertical-specific pattern exists.
4. **Rule Synthesis**: Formulate a clear, unified rule that explains the entire grid’s progression.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Based on your rule, describe exactly what the missing image (bottom-right cell) should look like before looking at the provided options.
6. **Final Matching**: Compare your detailed description to options A–D and select the perfect match.

*Only use information visible in the images. Do not assume hidden rules or patterns that aren't clearly shown. Answer in less than 500 words.*
