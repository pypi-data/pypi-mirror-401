# CapiscIO Python CLI

The **CapiscIO Python CLI** is a lightweight wrapper around the [CapiscIO Core](https://github.com/capiscio/capiscio-core) binary, designed for seamless integration into Python environments.

!!! info "This is a Wrapper Package"
    This package does NOT contain validation logic. It downloads and executes the `capiscio-core` Go binary, which performs the actual validation.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install
pip install capiscio

# Validate an agent card
capiscio validate ./agent-card.json

# Validate with JSON output
capiscio validate ./agent-card.json --json

# Check core binary version
capiscio --version
```

## What This Package Does

1. **Downloads** the correct `capiscio-core` binary for your platform (macOS/Linux/Windows, AMD64/ARM64)
2. **Caches** the binary in your user cache directory
3. **Executes** the binary with your arguments, using `os.execv()` for zero overhead

All validation logic lives in `capiscio-core`. This wrapper just makes it easy to install via pip.
