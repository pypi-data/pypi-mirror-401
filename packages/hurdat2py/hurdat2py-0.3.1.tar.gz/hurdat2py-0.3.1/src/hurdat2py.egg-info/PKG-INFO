* **Data:** National Hurricane Center (HURDAT2).
* **Inspiration:** The plotting aesthetic in this package was inspired by the excellent [tropycal](https://tropycal.github.io/tropycal/index.html) library. While `hurdat2py` is a standalone implementation, we aimed to match their publication-quality visual style.
