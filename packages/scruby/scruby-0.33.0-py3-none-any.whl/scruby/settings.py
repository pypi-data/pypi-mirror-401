"""Database settings.

The module contains the following parameters:

- `DB_ROOT` - Path to root directory of database. `By default = "ScrubyDB" (in root of project)`.
- `HASH_REDUCE_LEFT` - The length of the hash reduction on the left side.
    - `0` - 4294967296 branches in collection.
    - `2` - 16777216 branches in collection.
    - `4` - 65536 branches in collection.
    - `6` - 256 branches in collection (by default).
- `MAX_WORKERS` - The maximum number of processes that can be used `By default = None`.
- `PLUGINS` - For adding plugins.
