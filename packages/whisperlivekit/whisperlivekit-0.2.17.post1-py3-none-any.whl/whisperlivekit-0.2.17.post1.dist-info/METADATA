           TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION
        
           1. Definitions.
        
              "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,

              (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
        
              "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
              form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
              editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
              represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
              of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
              separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
              the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
        
              "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
              the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
              to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
              submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
              or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
              the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
              means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
              to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

              "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
              on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
              subsequently incorporated within the Work.
        
           2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
              publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
              Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
        
           3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
              this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
              worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
              (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
              use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
              where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
              by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
              Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
              with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
              institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
              cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
              or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
              or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
              granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
              as of the date such litigation is filed.
        
           4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
              Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
              modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
              meet the following conditions:
        
              (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
                  Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
        
              (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
                  stating that You changed the files; and
        
              (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
                  that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
                  attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
                  excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
                  the Derivative Works; and
        
              (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
                  distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
                  include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
                  within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
                  pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
                  of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
                  as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
                  documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
                  within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
                  wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
                  of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
                  do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
                  notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
                  or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
                  that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
                  as modifying the License.
        
              You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
              may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
              for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
              for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
              reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
              the conditions stated in this License.
        
           5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
              any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
              by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
              this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
              Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
              the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
              with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
        
           6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
              names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
              except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
              origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
        
           7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
              agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
              Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
              WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
              implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
              of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
              PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
              appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
              risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
        
           8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
              whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
              unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
              negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
              liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
              incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
              result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
              Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
              work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
              other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
              has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
        
           9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
              the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
              and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
              or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
              License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
              on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
              of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
              defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
              incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
              of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
        
           END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
        
           APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.

              boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"
              replaced with your own identifying information. (Don't include
              the brackets!)  The text should be enclosed in the appropriate
              comment syntax for the file format. We also recommend that a
              file or class name and description of purpose be included on the
              same "printed page" as the copyright notice for easier
              identification within third-party archives.

> **Why not just run a simple Whisper model on every audio batch?** Whisper is designed for complete utterances, not real-time chunks. Processing small segments loses context, cuts off words mid-syllable, and produces poor transcription. WhisperLiveKit uses state-of-the-art simultaneous speech research for intelligent buffering and incremental processing.


### Architecture

<img alt="Architecture" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/QuentinFuxa/WhisperLiveKit/refs/heads/main/architecture.png" />

*The backend supports multiple concurrent users. Voice Activity Detection reduces overhead when no voice is detected.*

### Installation & Quick Start

```bash
pip install whisperlivekit
```
> You can also clone the repo and `pip install -e .` for the latest version.

#### Quick Start
1. **Start the transcription server:**
   ```bash
   wlk --model base --language en
   ```

2. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. Start speaking and watch your words appear in real-time!


> - See [here](https://github.com/QuentinFuxa/WhisperLiveKit/blob/main/whisperlivekit/simul_whisper/whisper/tokenizer.py) for the list of all available languages.
> - Check the [troubleshooting guide](docs/troubleshooting.md) for step-by-step fixes collected from recent GPU setup/env issues.
> - The CLI entry point is exposed as both `wlk` and `whisperlivekit-server`; they are equivalent.
> - For HTTPS requirements, see the **Parameters** section for SSL configuration options.


#### Use it to capture audio from web pages.

Go to `chrome-extension` for instructions.

#### Optional Dependencies

| Optional | `pip install` |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Windows/Linux optimizations** | `faster-whisper` |
| **Apple Silicon optimizations** | `mlx-whisper` |
| **Translation** | `nllw` |
| **Speaker diarization** | `git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/NeMo.git@main#egg=nemo_toolkit[asr]` |
| OpenAI API | `openai` |
| *[Not recommanded]*  Speaker diarization with Diart | `diart` |

See  **Parameters & Configuration** below on how to use them.



### Usage Examples

**Command-line Interface**: Start the transcription server with various options:

```bash
# Large model and translate from french to danish
wlk --model large-v3 --language fr --target-language da

# Diarization and server listening on */80 
wlk --host 0.0.0.0 --port 80 --model medium --diarization --language fr
```


**Python API Integration**: Check [basic_server](https://github.com/QuentinFuxa/WhisperLiveKit/blob/main/whisperlivekit/basic_server.py) for a more complete example of how to use the functions and classes.

```python
import asyncio
from contextlib import asynccontextmanager

from fastapi import FastAPI, WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse

from whisperlivekit import AudioProcessor, TranscriptionEngine, parse_args

transcription_engine = None

@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    global transcription_engine
    transcription_engine = TranscriptionEngine(model="medium", diarization=True, lan="en")
    yield

app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

async def handle_websocket_results(websocket: WebSocket, results_generator):
    async for response in results_generator:
        await websocket.send_json(response)
    await websocket.send_json({"type": "ready_to_stop"})

@app.websocket("/asr")
async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
    global transcription_engine

    # Create a new AudioProcessor for each connection, passing the shared engine
    audio_processor = AudioProcessor(transcription_engine=transcription_engine)    
    results_generator = await audio_processor.create_tasks()
    results_task = asyncio.create_task(handle_websocket_results(websocket, results_generator))
    await websocket.accept()
    while True:
        message = await websocket.receive_bytes()
        await audio_processor.process_audio(message)        
```

**Frontend Implementation**: The package includes an HTML/JavaScript implementation [here](https://github.com/QuentinFuxa/WhisperLiveKit/blob/main/whisperlivekit/web/live_transcription.html). You can also import it using `from whisperlivekit import get_inline_ui_html` & `page = get_inline_ui_html()`


## Parameters & Configuration


| Parameter | Description | Default |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| `--model` | Whisper model size. List and recommandations [here](https://github.com/QuentinFuxa/WhisperLiveKit/blob/main/docs/default_and_custom_models.md) | `small` |
| `--model-path` | Local .pt file/directory **or** Hugging Face repo ID containing the Whisper model. Overrides `--model`. Recommandations [here](https://github.com/QuentinFuxa/WhisperLiveKit/blob/main/docs/default_and_custom_models.md) | `None` |
| `--language` | List [here](docs/supported_languages.md). If you use `auto`, the model attempts to detect the language automatically, but it tends to bias towards English. | `auto` |
| `--target-language` | If sets, translates using [NLLW](https://github.com/QuentinFuxa/NoLanguageLeftWaiting). [200 languages available](docs/supported_languages.md). If you want to translate to english, you can also use `--direct-english-translation`. The STT model will try to directly output the translation. | `None` |
| `--diarization` | Enable speaker identification | `False` |
| `--backend-policy` | Streaming strategy: `1`/`simulstreaming` uses AlignAtt SimulStreaming, `2`/`localagreement` uses the LocalAgreement policy | `simulstreaming` |

### 🚀 Deployment Guide

To deploy WhisperLiveKit in production:
 
1. **Server Setup**: Install production ASGI server & launch with multiple workers
   ```bash
   pip install uvicorn gunicorn
   gunicorn -k uvicorn.workers.UvicornWorker -w 4 your_app:app
   ```

2. **Frontend**: Host your customized version of the `html` example & ensure WebSocket connection points correctly

3. **Nginx Configuration** (recommended for production):
    ```nginx    
   server {
       listen 80;
       server_name your-domain.com;
        location / {
            proxy_pass http://localhost:8000;
            proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
            proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
            proxy_set_header Host $host;
    }}
    ```

4. **HTTPS Support**: For secure deployments, use "wss://" instead of "ws://" in WebSocket URL

## 🐋 Docker

Deploy the application easily using Docker with GPU or CPU support.

### Prerequisites
- Docker installed on your system
- For GPU support: NVIDIA Docker runtime installed

### Quick Start

**With GPU acceleration (recommended):**
```bash
docker build -t wlk .
docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 --name wlk wlk
```

**CPU only:**
```bash
docker build -f Dockerfile.cpu -t wlk .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --name wlk wlk
```

### Advanced Usage

**Custom configuration:**
```bash
# Example with custom model and language
docker run --gpus all -p 8000:8000 --name wlk wlk --model large-v3 --language fr
```

### Memory Requirements
- **Large models**: Ensure your Docker runtime has sufficient memory allocated


#### Customization

- `--build-arg` Options:
  - `EXTRAS="translation"` - Add extras to the image's installation (no spaces). Remember to set necessary container options!
  - `HF_PRECACHE_DIR="./.cache/"` - Pre-load a model cache for faster first-time start
  - `HF_TKN_FILE="./token"` - Add your Hugging Face Hub access token to download gated models
