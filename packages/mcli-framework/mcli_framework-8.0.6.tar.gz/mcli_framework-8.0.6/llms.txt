# mcli-framework

> Portable workflow framework that transforms any script into a versioned, schedulable command. Run `mcli context --full` for comprehensive agent documentation.

mcli is a Python CLI tool (v8.0.5) that provides workflow automation, command management, and IPFS-based sync. It enables ML models and agents to execute scripts, manage workflows, and automate tasks programmatically.
