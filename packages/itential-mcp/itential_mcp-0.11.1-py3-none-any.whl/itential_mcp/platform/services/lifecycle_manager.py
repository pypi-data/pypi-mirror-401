class Service(ServiceBase):
    """Service class for managing Lifecycle Manager resource models in Itential Platform.

    The Service provides methods for interacting with Lifecycle Manager
    resource models, which define the structure, validation rules, and lifecycle
    workflows for network services and infrastructure components. Resource models
    serve as templates for creating and managing resource instances throughout
    their operational lifecycle.

    Lifecycle Manager resources enable structured management of network services
    by defining JSON Schema-based data models that specify required fields,
    validation constraints, and relationships. These models support complex
    service provisioning, configuration management, and decommissioning workflows.

    Resource models can include lifecycle actions (CREATE, UPDATE, DELETE) that
    define the specific workflows and operations available for instances of that
    resource type. This enables consistent and repeatable service management
    across diverse network infrastructure.

    Inherits from ServiceBase and implements the required describe method for
    retrieving detailed resource model information by name.
