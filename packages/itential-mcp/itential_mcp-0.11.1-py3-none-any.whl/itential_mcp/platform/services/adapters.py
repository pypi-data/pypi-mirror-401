    Service class for managing Itential Platform adapters.

    This service provides comprehensive adapter lifecycle management including
    starting, stopping, and restarting adapters. It handles state validation,
    timeout management, and error conditions for adapter operations.

    Attributes:
        name (str): The service name identifier set to "adapters"

    Notes:
        All adapter operations include polling for state transitions with
        configurable timeouts to ensure operations complete successfully.

        Retrieve health information for a specific adapter from Itential Platform.

        This internal method queries the platform's health API to get current
        state and metadata for the specified adapter. It validates that exactly
        one adapter matches the provided name.

        Notes:
