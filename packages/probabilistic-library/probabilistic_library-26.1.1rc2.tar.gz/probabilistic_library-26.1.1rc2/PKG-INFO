# Probabilistic Library

This is the repository of the Probabilistic Library of Deltares.

The library provides a set of routines that enable reliability, uncertainty, and sensitivity analyses.

## Scientific background

The scientific background can be found here:
[scientific_background.pdf](https://github.com/Deltares/ProbabilisticLibrary/releases/download/25.3.1/scientific_background.pdf)

## Python wrapper

You can access the routines of the library using a Python wrapper. 
A description of the Python classes is given here:
[API documentation](https://deltares.github.io/ProbabilisticLibrary/probabilistic_library.html)

### Installation

Install the library as follows:
```
pip install probabilistic-library
```

### Tutorials

See the [Tutorials](https://github.com/Deltares/ProbabilisticLibrary/blob/master/sources/Deltares.Probabilistic.PWrapper.Notebooks/gallery/gallery.md) for several demonstrations and instructions on how to use the Probabilistic Library. Jupyter notebooks are available for each item and demonstrate how to use the Probabilistic Library.
