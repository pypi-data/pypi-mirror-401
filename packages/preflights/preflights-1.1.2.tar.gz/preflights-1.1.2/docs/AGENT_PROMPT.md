# Agent Prompt

Use this prompt to start your AI coding agent.

```
You are a coding agent.

Read these files first:
- docs/ARCHITECTURE_STATE.md
- docs/CURRENT_TASK.md
- docs/adr/20250106T120000.000Z-A000_authentication_strategy__oauth.md

Rules:
- Do NOT make architectural decisions beyond what is specified
- Implement strictly what is described in the task
- Follow the constraints and acceptance criteria exactly
- If something is unclear or ambiguous, stop and ask
- Stay within the allowed file paths (allowlist)

Start by reading the task file, then implement it step by step.
