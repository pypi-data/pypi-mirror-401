"""Async-sync bridge utilities for Foundation.

Provides utilities for bridging async and sync code, particularly useful
for CLI commands that need to call async clients or functions."""

def run_async(coro: Coroutine[None, None, T] | Awaitable[T], *, warn: bool = False) -> T:
    """Run an async coroutine from sync context.

    **IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS:**

    This is a bridge utility for running async code from sync contexts (e.g., CLI commands).
    It should NOT be used in async contexts - use `await` directly instead.

    **When to use:**
    - CLI commands that need to call async client methods
    - Sync utility functions that need to call async APIs
    - Test fixtures that need to run async code synchronously

    **When NOT to use:**
    - Inside async functions (use `await` instead)
    - In performance-critical loops (creates event loop overhead)
    - With long-running coroutines (blocks the thread)

    **Limitations:**
    - Creates a new event loop if one doesn't exist (has overhead)
    - Blocks the calling thread until coroutine completes
    - Cannot run multiple coroutines concurrently
    - Should not be nested (will raise RuntimeError)

    Args:
        coro: Async coroutine or awaitable to run
        warn: If True, logs a warning when used (for debugging)

    Returns:
        Result from the coroutine

    Raises:
        RuntimeError: If called from within an already-running event loop

    Example:
        ```python
        from provide.foundation.utils.async_helpers import run_async

        async def fetch_data():
            client = UniversalClient()
            return await client.get("https://api.example.com/data")

        result = run_async(fetch_data())

        # ❌ BAD: Inside an async function
        async def my_async_function():
            result = run_async(some_coro())  # Wrong! Use await instead
        ```

    Note:
        Consider refactoring to use native async entry points instead of
        bridging sync/async boundaries. This function is a convenience for
        specific use cases, not a general-purpose async executor.
