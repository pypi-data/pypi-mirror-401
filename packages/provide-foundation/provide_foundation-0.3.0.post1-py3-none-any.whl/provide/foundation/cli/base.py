    Adapters convert framework-agnostic CommandInfo objects into

    Currently provides ClickAdapter. Custom adapters for other frameworks (Typer, argparse)
    can be implemented by following the CLIAdapter protocol.

    See: docs/guide/advanced/integration-patterns.md#custom-cli-adapters

    Examples:
        >>> from provide.foundation.cli import get_cli_adapter
        >>> adapter = get_cli_adapter('click')
        >>> command = adapter.build_command(command_info)
