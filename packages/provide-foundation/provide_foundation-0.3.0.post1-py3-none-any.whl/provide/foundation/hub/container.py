"""DI Container - A focused wrapper for dependency injection patterns.

This module provides a Container class that wraps the Hub with a cleaner
API specifically designed for dependency injection workflows. This is ideal
for users who prefer pure DI patterns over Service Locator.

Example:
    >>> from provide.foundation.hub import Container, injectable
    >>>
    >>> @injectable
    >>> class MyService:
    ...     def __init__(self, db: Database, logger: Logger):
    ...         self.db = db
    ...         self.logger = logger
    >>>
    >>> # Composition Root (main.py)
    >>> container = Container()
    >>> container.register(Database, db_instance)
    >>> container.register(Logger, logger_instance)
    >>> service = container.resolve(MyService)
"""

class Container:
    """Dependency Injection Container.

    A focused API for dependency injection patterns, wrapping the Hub
    with a simpler interface for type-based registration and resolution.

    This container follows the Composition Root pattern where all
    dependencies are registered at application startup and then resolved
    as needed.

    Example:
        >>> container = Container()
        >>> container.register(DatabaseClient, db_instance)
        >>> container.register(HTTPClient, http_instance)
        >>>
        >>> # Resolve with automatic dependency injection
        >>> service = container.resolve(MyService)
        >>> # MyService.__init__(db, http) called automatically

    Pattern:
        The Container is designed for the Composition Root pattern:
        1. Create container at app startup (main.py)
        2. Register all core dependencies
        3. Resolve application entry points
        4. Pass dependencies explicitly (no global access)

    This matches the idiomatic patterns in Go and Rust, making it
    easier to adopt for developers from those ecosystems.
