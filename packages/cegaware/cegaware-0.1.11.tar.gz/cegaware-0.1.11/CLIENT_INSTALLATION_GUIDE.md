# Cegaware Python SDK – Client Installation Guide

This guide explains how to install, configure, and start using the **Cegaware Python SDK** in a clean and secure way.

---

## 1. Prerequisites

Before installing the SDK, make sure you have:

* **Python 3.9 or newer**
* `pip` correctly installed
* Internet access to PyPI

You can verify your Python installation with:

```bash
python --version
```

---

## 2. Installing the Cegaware SDK

Install the SDK directly from PyPI:

```bash
pip install cegaware
```

After installation, verify that the package is available:

```python
import cegaware
print(cegaware.__version__)
```

---

## 3. Authentication (Required)

All Cegaware API features require authentication.

### Purpose

Authentication allows you to obtain an **API token valid for 60 minutes**, which must be passed to all subsequent API calls.

### Required credentials

* `Username`
* `Password`

### Authentication flow

1. Provide your credentials
2. Call the authentication function
3. Store the returned API token
4. Re-authenticate when the token expires

---

## 4. Basic Authentication Example

```python
import cegaware as cw

# Initialize logger
logger = cw.Logger()

# Prepare authentication request
results = cw.GetAPIToken_Results(
    Username="YOUR_USERNAME",
    Password="YOUR_PASSWORD"
)

# Perform authentication
if cw.GetAPIToken(results, logger):
    api_token = results.APIToken
    print("Authentication successful")
else:
    raise RuntimeError("Authentication failed")
```

> ⚠️ **Security note**
>
> * Never hardcode credentials in shared notebooks or repositories
> * Store credentials securely (environment variables, secret manager, etc.)

---

## 5. Using the API Token

Once authenticated:

* The API token is **valid for 60 minutes**
* The token must be provided to all API calls that require authentication
* When expired, the authentication step must be repeated

---

## 6. Typical Usage Pattern

```text
Start session
  └─ Authenticate → Get API Token
        └─ Call API features
              └─ Token expires → Re-authenticate
```

---

## 7. Troubleshooting

### Common issues

**Import error**

```text
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'cegaware'
```

Solution:

```bash
pip install cegaware
```

---

**Authentication failure**

* Verify username and password
* Ensure system clock is correct
* Check network access to the Cegaware API

---

## 8. Support

If you encounter any issue:

* Contact your Cegaware support representative
* Provide logs generated by `cw.Logger()` when reporting errors
