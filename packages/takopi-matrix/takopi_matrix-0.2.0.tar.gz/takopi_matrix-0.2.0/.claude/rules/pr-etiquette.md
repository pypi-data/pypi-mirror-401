# PR Etiquette

Creating pull requests is fine. Merging them is not your job.

## DO
- Create PRs with clear descriptions
- Run checks before creating PRs (`just check`, tests, linting)
- Provide the PR URL to the user

## DON'T
- Merge PRs automatically
- Approve PRs
- Close PRs without user instruction

Merging is the user's responsibility.
