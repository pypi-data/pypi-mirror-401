This Odoo module adds the capability to customize font size in all PDF reports throughout the system. Through a simple configuration, administrators can select from a range of predefined font sizes (measured in points) to optimize readability and appearance of invoices, quotations, sales orders, and other printed documents.

The module offers the following font size options (in points):

| Option | Size | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| Small | 9pt | For maximum compactness |
| Standard | 10pt | Odoo's default size |
| Large | 12pt | Better readability |
| Extra Large | 14pt | For high visibility needs |
