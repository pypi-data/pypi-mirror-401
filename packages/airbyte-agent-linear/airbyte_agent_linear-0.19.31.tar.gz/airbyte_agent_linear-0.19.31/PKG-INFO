# Linear agent connector

Linear is a modern issue tracking and project management tool built for software
development teams. This connector provides access to issues, projects, and teams
for sprint planning, backlog management, and development workflow analysis.


## Example questions

The Linear connector is optimized to handle prompts like these.

- Show me the open issues assigned to my team this week
- List out all projects I'm currently involved in
- Analyze the workload distribution across my development team
- What are the top priority issues in our current sprint?
- Identify the most active projects in our organization right now
- Summarize the recent issues for \{team_member\} in the last two weeks
- Compare the issue complexity across different teams
- Which projects have the most unresolved issues?
- Give me an overview of my team's current project backlog

## Unsupported questions

The Linear connector isn't currently able to handle prompts like these.

- Create a new issue for the backend team
- Update the priority of this specific issue
- Assign a team member to this project
- Delete an outdated project from our workspace
- Schedule a sprint planning meeting
- Move an issue to a different project

```bash
uv pip install airbyte-agent-linear

from airbyte_agent_linear import LinearConnector, LinearAuthConfig

connector = LinearConnector(
  auth_config=LinearAuthConfig(
