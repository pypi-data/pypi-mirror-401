**Oubli**: French for "forgetting." (Also a West African fruit so sweet it makes babies forget their mother's milk.)

A memory system that never forgets. Persistent fractal memory for Claude Code.

## Quickstart: Bootstrap Your AI's Memory in 5 Minutes

**1. Install Oubli**
```bash
pip install oubli
cd /your/project
oubli setup
```
Restart Claude Code.

**2. Export what your AI already knows about you**

Go to ChatGPT, Gemini, or Claude.ai and ask:
> "Give me a complete dump of everything you know about me — preferences, facts, work, family, interests and any interesting memories from our conversations."

Copy the output.

**3. Import into Oubli**

Paste into Claude Code and say:
> "Import this into my memory"

Claude parses and stores each fact as a searchable memory.

**4. Synthesize into insights**

Run `/synthesize` to consolidate raw memories into a hierarchy — and generate your Core Memory (the essential "you" that loads in every conversation).

**5. Visualize your memory graph**

```bash
/visualize-memory
```

*Your memories, organized. Raw facts at the top, synthesized insights below. Filter by topic, hover for details.*

## Features

- **Fractal in Both Directions** - Synthesize raw memories into insights, drill down from insights to source details
- **Hybrid Search** - Combines BM25 keyword search + semantic embeddings for intelligent retrieval
- **Core Memory** - Essential facts about you (~2K tokens), loaded in every conversation
- **Proactive Memory** - Claude searches and saves automatically, no prompting needed
- **Immediate Updates** - Family, work, and identity changes update Core Memory instantly
- **Quiet Operation** - Memory operations happen silently in the background
- **Local-First** - All data stays on your machine, no external services
- **Visual Graph** - Interactive visualization of your memory hierarchy (`oubli viz`)

## Installation

```bash
pip install oubli
cd /path/to/your/project
oubli setup  # Installs everything locally in this project
```

Then restart Claude Code. The embedding model (~80MB) downloads on first use.

**Everything is project-local by default:**
- `.mcp.json` - MCP server registration
- `.claude/` - Hooks, commands, instructions
- `.oubli/` - Your memories and Core Memory

This means each project has its own isolated Oubli installation and memories.

### Global Installation (Optional)

To install globally (shared across all projects):

```bash
oubli setup --global
```

This registers the MCP server globally and puts everything in `~/.claude/` and `~/.oubli/`.

### Requirements

- Python 3.10+
- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) CLI installed

### Uninstall

```bash
oubli uninstall           # Removes local installation from current project
oubli uninstall --global  # Removes global installation
pip uninstall oubli
```

## How It Works

### Fractal Memory Hierarchy

The memory system is **fractal in both directions**:

```
           ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
           │            CORE MEMORY                  │
           │    (~2K tokens, always in context)      │
           │                                         │
           │  Identity, family, work, preferences    │
           └─────────────────────┬───────────────────┘
                                 │
                    ▲ synthesis  │  drill-down ▼
                                 │
Level 2    ○ "Deeply technical, values efficiency"
            ╲
Level 1    ○ ○ "Loves jazz fusion"  "Python expert"
            ╲│
Level 0    ○○○○ Raw memories with full conversation text
```

- **Upward (Synthesis)**: Raw memories consolidate into higher-level insights
- **Downward (Drill-down)**: From any insight, retrieve its source memories for full detail

| Level | Contains | Use Case |
|-------|----------|----------|
| Core Memory | Essential identity (~2K tokens) | Always loaded, answers most questions |
| Level 1+ | Synthesized insights | Quick context without full details |
| Level 0 | Raw memories + full conversation | When you need exact quotes or specifics |

### Hybrid Search

Oubli uses LanceDB's hybrid search combining:
- **BM25 Full-Text Search** - Finds keyword matches
- **Semantic Embeddings** - Finds conceptually related content (via sentence-transformers)
- **RRF Reranking** - Merges both result sets intelligently

Example: Searching "jazz music" finds memories about "Pat Metheny" and "fusion harmonies" even without exact keyword matches.

### Synthesis (Bottom-Up)

Run `/synthesize` to consolidate raw memories into insights:

1. **Merge duplicates** - Similar memories at each level are combined
2. **Group by topic** - Related memories clustered together
3. **Create insights** - Level 1+ memories synthesize the patterns
4. **Update Core Memory** - Incrementally updated (additions from insights, removals only with contradicting evidence)

### Drill-Down Retrieval (Top-Down)

When you need more detail than a high-level insight provides:

1. **Search** returns synthesized insights first (compact, high-signal)
2. **Get parents** retrieves the source memories that formed an insight
3. **Get full text** retrieves the complete conversation from a Level 0 memory

Nothing is ever lost - every insight links back to its source memories.

## Usage

### Natural Interaction

Just talk naturally. Claude handles memory operations silently:
- "I prefer TypeScript over JavaScript" → Saved automatically
- "What do you know about my work?" → Searches memory
- "I no longer work at Spotify" → Deletes old, saves new, updates Core Memory

### Import Existing Memories

Paste your Claude.ai memory export and ask:
> "Import this into my memory"

Claude parses it into structured memories and optionally creates your Core Memory.

### Slash Commands

- `/synthesize` - Run full synthesis: merge duplicates, create insights, update Core Memory
- `/clear-memories` - Clear all memories (requires confirmation)

### CLI Commands

```bash
oubli viz              # Open interactive memory graph in browser
oubli viz --no-open    # Generate graph.html without opening
```

The visualization shows:
- **Hierarchical tree** - Raw memories at top, synthesized insights below
- **Topic sidebar** - Filter by topic to focus on specific areas
- **Color coding** - Blue (L0 raw), Green (L1), Purple (L2+)
- **Tooltips** - Hover for full summary, topics, keywords
