# High-recall settings for herbarium specimens with degraded DNA
#
# Use this profile when working with:
# - Herbarium specimens where DNA may be degraded
# - Type specimens that cannot be resampled
# - Samples where contamination may dominate the target
# - Any situation where false negatives are more costly than false positives
#
# The settings prioritize keeping all potential biological signal for
# manual review, at the cost of more output variants.
