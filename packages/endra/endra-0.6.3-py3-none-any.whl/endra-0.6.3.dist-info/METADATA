A peer-to-peer encrypted messaging protocol supporting multiple devices per user.

See the EndraApp project for a GUI messaging application for desktop and mobile implementing Endra.

## Features

- fully peer to peer, no servers of any kind
- can function independently of internet connectivity
- multiple devices per profile (user account)
- multiple profiles per device
- cryptography:
	- full end-to-end encryption
	- key rotation
	- hybrid cryptography combining classical and post-quantum algorithms
	- cryptographic agility (upgradable to novel algorithms)
	- perfect forward and backward secrecy for transmissions
- can be used as a library for embedding into other applications
- will become part of an expandable ecosystem incl. calendar and file-sharing
- [app for desktop and mobile](https://github.com/emendir/EndraApp) (builds for Linux (Ubuntu 24 x86-64 & arm64), Android (arm64), Windows 11 (x86-64) and MacOS (x86-64 & arm64))

## Documentation

The thorough documentation for this project and the technologies it's based on live in a dedicated repository:

- [Endra](https://github.com/emendir/WalytisTechnologies/blob/master/Endra/1-IntroToEndra.md): learn how Endra works
- [Walytis Technologies](https://github.com/emendir/WalytisTechnologies): learn about the suite of tools which Endra is part of, built to enable developers to easily develop peer-to-peer distributed applications.

## Project Status **EXPERIMENTAL**

This library is very early in its development.

The API of this library IS LIKELY TO CHANGE in the near future!

## [RoadMap](https://github.com/emendir/WalytisTechnologies/blob/master/RoadMap.md)

See the [Walytis Technologies RoadMap](https://github.com/emendir/WalytisTechnologies/blob/master/RoadMap.md) for the current plans for Endra in the context of the larger [Walytis Technologies Project](https://github.com/emendir/WalytisTechnologies).
