"""
This module defines the `EventContract` abstract base class and related
components to represent the outcome of operations in the system.

It provides a standardized structure for capturing:
    - Operation details
    - Execution status (success, partial success, failure, pending)
    - Reason for the status
    - Optional reference to the execution unit that produced the event

Components:
    - StatusCodes: Enum representing possible execution states
    - EventContract: Abstract base class for creating event contracts
      associated with operations.
