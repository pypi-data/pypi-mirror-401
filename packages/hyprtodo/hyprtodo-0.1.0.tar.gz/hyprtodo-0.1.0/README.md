An app written in python using textual for keeping a todo list

## Am I able to install it? 
If you have the support for pipx and are using a linux machine, you should be able to use the program as it is written in python.

## How Does it Work?
It writes to a file that is in the standard location in the hypr ecosystem(~/.config/hypr/hyprtodo/). Python will read from that file and create a list. Using textual a that list is displayed into a usable and more friendly TUI
