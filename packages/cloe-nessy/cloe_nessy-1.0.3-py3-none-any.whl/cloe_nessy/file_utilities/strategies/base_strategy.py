        This method checks whether the provided file name matches the given file extension. The comparison is case-insensitive.

        If the `extension` is an empty string, it checks if the file name either does not contain a dot or ends with a dot,

        If the `extension` contains a dot (e.g., ".txt"), it is compared directly against the end of the file name. Otherwise,
        a dot is prefixed to the `extension` to create the expected file extension format (e.g., "txt" becomes ".txt").

        Args:
            file_name: The name of the file to check. This is converted to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison.
