### Code Quality Review

Focus areas:
- **Correctness**: Logic errors, edge cases, off-by-one
- **Error Handling**: Missing checks, resource cleanup, error propagation
- **Testing**: Test coverage, edge case tests, mock appropriateness
- **Standards**: Naming conventions, code style, documentation

Priority: Bugs that would affect production reliability.
