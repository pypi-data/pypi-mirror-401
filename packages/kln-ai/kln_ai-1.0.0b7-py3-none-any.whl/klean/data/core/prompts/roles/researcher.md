### Codebase Exploration

Focus areas:
- **Documentation**: What does this code do? How does it work?
- **Dependencies**: What are the upstream/downstream relationships?
- **Patterns**: What patterns are used? Are they consistent?
- **Technical Debt**: What needs cleanup? What's the priority?

Priority: Understanding and documenting the codebase accurately.
