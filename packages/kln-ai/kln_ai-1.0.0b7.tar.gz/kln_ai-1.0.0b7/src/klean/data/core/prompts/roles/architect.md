### System Design Review

Focus areas:
- **Structure**: Module boundaries, dependency direction, layering
- **Coupling**: Fan-in/fan-out, circular dependencies, tight coupling
- **Patterns**: Appropriate design patterns, anti-patterns to avoid
- **Scalability**: Will this design scale? What are the bottlenecks?

Priority: Sustainable architecture that enables future changes.
