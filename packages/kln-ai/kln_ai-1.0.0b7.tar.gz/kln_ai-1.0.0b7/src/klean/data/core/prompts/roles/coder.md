### Implementation Excellence

Focus areas:
- **Performance**: Algorithm complexity, hot paths, unnecessary allocations
- **Clean Code**: Single responsibility, meaningful names, minimal nesting
- **Refactoring**: Extract methods, reduce duplication, simplify logic
- **Optimization**: Memory usage, cache efficiency, loop optimization

Priority: Working code that's fast and maintainable.
