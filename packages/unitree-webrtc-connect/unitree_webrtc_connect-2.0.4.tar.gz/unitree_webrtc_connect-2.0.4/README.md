# Unitree Go2 and G1 WebRTC Driver

This repository contains a Python implementation of the WebRTC driver to connect to the Unitree Go2 and G1 Robots. WebRTC is used by the Unitree Go/Unitree Explore APP and provides high-level control through it. Therefore, no jailbreak or firmware manipulation is required. It works out of the box for Go2 AIR/PRO/EDU models and G1 AIR/EDU.

## Currently Supported Firmware Versions

**Go2:**
- **1.1.x series**: 1.1.1 – 1.1.11 *(latest available)*
- **1.0.x series**: 1.0.19 – 1.0.25

**G1:**
- **1.4.0** *(latest available)*

## Audio and Video Support (Go2 only)

There are video (recvonly) and audio (sendrecv) channels in WebRTC that you can connect to. Check out the examples in the `/example` folder.

## Lidar support (Go2 only)

There is a lidar decoder built in, so you can handle decoded PoinClouds directly. Check out the examples in the `/example` folder.

## Connection Methods

The driver supports three types of connection methods:

1. **AP Mode**: Go2/G1 is in AP mode, and the WebRTC client is connected directly to it:

    ```python
    UnitreeWebRTCConnection(WebRTCConnectionMethod.LocalAP)
    ```

2. **STA-L Mode**: Go2/G1 and the WebRTC client are on the same local network. An IP or Serial number is required:

    ```python
    UnitreeWebRTCConnection(WebRTCConnectionMethod.LocalSTA, ip="192.168.8.181")
    ```


    If the IP is unknown, you can specify only the serial number, and the driver will try to find the IP using the special Multicast discovery feature available on Go2:

    ```python
    UnitreeWebRTCConnection(WebRTCConnectionMethod.LocalSTA, serialNumber="B42D2000XXXXXXXX")
    ```

3. **STA-T mode**: Remote connection through remote Unitrees TURN server. Could control your Go2/G1 even being on the diffrent network. Requires username and pass from Unitree account

    ```python
    UnitreeWebRTCConnection(WebRTCConnectionMethod.Remote, serialNumber="B42D2000XXXXXXXX", username="email@gmail.com", password="pass")
    ```

## Multicast scanner (Go2 only)
The driver has a built-in Multicast scanner to find the Unitree Go2 on the local network and connect using only the serial number.

## PIP installation (Recommended)

```sh
cd ~
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y python3-pip portaudio19-dev
pip install unitree_webrtc_connect
```


## Manual Installation
