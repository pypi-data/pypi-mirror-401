    """
        Returns a pseudo code to check business constraints on a tool cool using an API

        Args:
            policy_item (ToolGuardSpecItem): Business policy, in natural language, specifying a constraint on a process involving the tool under analysis.
            fn_to_analyze (str): The function signature of the tool under analysis.
            domain (Domain): Python code defining available data types and APIs for invoking other tools.

        Returns:
            str: A pseudo code descibing how to use the API to check the tool call

        * The available API functions are listed in the `domain.app_api.content`.
        * Analyze the API functions' signatures (input and output parameter types).
        * You cannot assume other API functions.
        * For data objects (dataclasses or Pydantic models), only reference the explicitly declared fields.
            * Do not assume the presence of any additional fields.
            * Do not assume any implicit logic or relationships between field values (e.g., naming conventions).
        * List all the required API calls to check the business constraints.
        * If some information is missing, you should call another api function declared in the domain API.
