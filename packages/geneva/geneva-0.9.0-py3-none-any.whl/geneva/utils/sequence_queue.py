    """A queue that maintains order based on sequence positions.

    Items can be inserted with their position and size, and the queue will maintain
    them in order. The pop() method will only return an item if the next
    expected position is available. When an item is popped, the next position
    advances by the item's size.

    This only works if the sequence covers the entire range of positions
    without any gaps.  If there are gaps then the queue will never emit an
    item and just fill up.

    Example:
        >>> q = SequenceQueue[str]()
        >>> q.put(1, 2, "second")  # position 2, size 2
        >>> q.put(0, 1, "first")   # position 0, size 2
        >>> q.put(3, 1, "third")   # position 3, size 1
        >>> q.pop()  # Returns "first" (advances position by 1)
        >>> q.pop()  # Returns "second" (advances position by 2)
        >>> q.pop()  # Returns "third" (advances position by 1)
