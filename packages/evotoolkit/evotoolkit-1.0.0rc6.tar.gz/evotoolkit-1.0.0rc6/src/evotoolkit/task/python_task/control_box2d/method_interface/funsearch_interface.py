"""
FunSearch interface for control policy evolution.

FunSearch uses a simple single-prompt approach that shows the LLM
existing solutions and asks for improvements. It's straightforward
and effective for incremental optimization.

Propose a NEW control policy that achieves HIGHER reward than the current one.
