# Extractor general contracts/logic:
------------------------------------


Represent all the files associated to a runner (IDE, terminal, sqlide, ...), holding the 
logic/tools to build the various sections contents.

Context/Contracts/Goals:

* An Extractor is linked to a single PMT file, with its potential "direct" dependencies
(aka REMs, or tests/corr files with the PM source project's setup).

* The PMT file can actually not exist at all! (in that case, exo_file is None)

* A PMT file, if it exists, contains sections delimited by tokens (comments) in the form:
        
        {head} (PMT|PYODIDE):{section} {tail}
        
  Where `head` and `tail` depend on the type of the file, to build a valide comment (python, sql, ...).

* An Extractor instance is cached based on the absolute/resolved path to the targeted
 file (aka `self.exo_file`).

* The file is automatically refreshed when a local file has been modified.

* The concrete contents of the files are stored in the instance, avoiding multiple HDD
reads operations. Note that the content is stored "as is", meaning the inclusions are not 
resolved yet, but the code is analyzed so that the inclusions are known upfront.

* The final/actual contents are never stored in the object: the concrete contents are 
always built on the fly/on demand, so that all inclusions redirections can apply where 
needed.
