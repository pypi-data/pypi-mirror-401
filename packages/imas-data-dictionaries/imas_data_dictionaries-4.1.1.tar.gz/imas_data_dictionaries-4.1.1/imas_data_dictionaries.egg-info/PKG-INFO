# IMAS Data Dictionary Archive

This repository contains an archive of released versions of the [IMAS Data
Dictionary](https://github.com/iterorganization/IMAS-Data-Dictionary) and
corresponding identifiers. The oldest version included is `3.22.0`. The version
of this repository corresponds to the latest included Data Dictionary release.
For example, version `4.0.0` of this repository will include all Data Dictionary
versions from `3.22.0` to `4.0.0`.

The goals of this repository are:
1. Allow easy access to released IMAS Data Dictionary definitions, such that
   they can be used by other tools which rely on them.
2. Make an archive of the definitions available as a Python package, which other
   tools (like [IMAS-Python](https://github.com/iterorganization/IMAS-Python))
   can depend on.
