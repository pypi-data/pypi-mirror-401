"""HotPotQA environment for aviary agents.

Implements the HotPotQA multihop question-answering environment from:

Yao et al., ReAct: Synergizing Reasoning and Acting in Language Models.
In The Eleventh International Conference on Learning Representations. 2023

Agents in the HotPotQA environment can perform searches and lookups to retrieve specific information.
The environment supports 3 tools:

search[entity]: Search for a specific entity on Wikipedia and return relevant information.
lookup[keyword]: Find and return the next sentence containing the keyword in the current passage.
submit_answer[answer]: Submit the final answer to the question and conclude the task.
