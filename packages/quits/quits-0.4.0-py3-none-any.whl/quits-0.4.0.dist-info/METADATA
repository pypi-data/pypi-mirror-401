# QUITS: A modular Qldpc code circUIT Simulator

QUITS is a modular and flexible circuit-level simulator for quantum low-density parity check (QLDPC) codes. Its design allows users to freely combine LDPC code constructions, syndrome extraction circuits, decoding algorithms, and noise models, enabling comprehensive and customizable studies of the performance of QLDPC codes under circuit-level noise. QUITS supports several leading QLDPC families, including 
- HyperGraph Product (HGP) codes 
- Quasi-cyclic Lifted Product (QLP) codes, and 
- Balanced Product Cyclic (BPC) codes. 

Check out [arXiv:2504.02673](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02673) for a detailed description of our package. 

QUITS is best used together with the following libraries:
- [Stim](https://github.com/quantumlib/Stim) (fast stabilizer circuit simulator) 
- [LDPC](https://github.com/quantumgizmos/ldpc) (BP-OSD, BP-LSD decoders for QLDPC codes)

See [doc/intro.ipynb](https://github.com/mkangquantum/quits/blob/main/doc/intro.ipynb) to get started!

Since the release of QUITS, we acknowledge the feedback and suggestions from Ryan Tiew, Josias Old, and qodesign that helped improve the package. If you’re working on QLDPC codes, decoders, or noise modeling, it'd be great if you could try QUITS, file issues, or contribute features. Let’s build better tools for scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computing together ⚛️
