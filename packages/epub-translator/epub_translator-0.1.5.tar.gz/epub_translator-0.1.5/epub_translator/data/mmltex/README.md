# XSLT MathML Library

This directory contains XSLT stylesheets from the **XSLT MathML Library 2.1.2**, a set of XSLT stylesheets to transform MathML 2.0 to LaTeX.

**Note**: These files are included for reference purposes. Our project uses a custom Python implementation to convert MathML to LaTeX, but we keep these XSLT files as a reference for understanding MathML element mappings and conversion rules.

## File Manifest

- `mmltex.xsl` - Main stylesheet
- `tokens.xsl` - Token elements (mi, mn, mo, etc.)
- `glayout.xsl` - Layout elements (mfrac, msqrt, etc.)
- `scripts.xsl` - Script elements (msub, msup, etc.)
- `tables.xsl` - Table elements (mtable, mtr, mtd)
- `entities.xsl` - Entity definitions
