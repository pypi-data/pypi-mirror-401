        Understanding Diabetes Symptoms: A Detailed Explanation\\n\\nLet me break
        down these symptoms in simple terms so you can understand what's happening
        in your body and why these signs occur.\\n\\n## **The Classic Symptoms (The
        \\\"Three P's\\\")**\\n\\n### **1. Excessive Thirst (Polydipsia)**\\nImagine
        your body is trying to flush out excess sugar through your urine. As you lose
        more fluid, you become dehydrated, making you feel constantly thirsty\u2014no
        matter how much water you drink.\\n\\n### **2. Frequent Urination (Polyuria)**\\nWhen
        blood sugar levels are too high, your kidneys work overtime to filter it out.
        This means you'll need to urinate much more often than usual, including waking
        up multiple times during the night.\\n\\n### **3. Increased Hunger (Polyphagia)**\\nEven
        though you're eating, your cells aren't getting the energy they need because
        insulin isn't working properly. Your body thinks it's starving, so you feel
        hungry all the time.\\n\\n### **4. Unexplained Weight Loss**\\nThis seems
        contradictory\u2014eating more but losing weight. Since your body can't use
        glucose for energy, it starts burning fat and muscle instead, causing weight
        loss.\\n\\n## **Other Important Symptoms**\\n\\n### **Fatigue and Weakness**\\nWithout
        glucose entering your cells properly, it's like having a car with a full gas
        tank but a broken fuel pump\u2014the energy is there, but your body can't
        access it.\\n\\n### **Blurred Vision**\\nHigh blood sugar causes the lens
        in your eye to swell, changing its shape and affecting your ability to focus
        clearly.\\n\\n### **Slow-Healing Wounds**\\nHigh blood sugar damages blood
        vessels and nerves, reducing circulation and your body's ability to repair
        itself.\\n\\n### **Frequent Infections**\\nBacteria and fungi thrive in sugar-rich
        environments. High blood sugar weakens your immune system and creates conditions
        where infections flourish.\\n\\n### **Tingling or Numbness**\\nOver time,
        high blood sugar damages nerves (called neuropathy), typically starting in
        your extremities\u2014hands and feet.\\n\\n## **Important Differences**\\n\\n**Type
        1 Diabetes** symptoms appear suddenly (weeks) because the pancreas stops producing
        insulin rapidly. This is more common in children and young adults.\\n\\n**Type
        2 Diabetes** symptoms develop slowly (months to years) because insulin resistance
        builds gradually. Many people don't realize they have it until complications
        arise.\\n\\n## **When to Seek Help**\\n\\nIf you notice several of these symptoms,
        especially the classic ones, see a doctor promptly. A simple blood test can
        diagnose diabetes, and early treatment prevents serious complications like
        heart disease, kidney damage, and vision loss.\"}],\"role\":\"assistant\"}},\"stopReason\":\"end_turn\",\"usage\":{\"cacheReadInputTokenCount\":0,\"cacheReadInputTokens\":0,\"cacheWriteInputTokenCount\":0,\"cacheWriteInputTokens\":0,\"inputTokens\":212,\"outputTokens\":606,\"serverToolUsage\":{},\"totalTokens\":818}}"
