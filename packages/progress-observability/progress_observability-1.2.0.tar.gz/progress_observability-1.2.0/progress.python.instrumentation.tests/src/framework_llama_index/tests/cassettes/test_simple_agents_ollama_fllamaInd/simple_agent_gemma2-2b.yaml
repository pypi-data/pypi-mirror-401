        hosted service via API, web access, or any other electronic or remote means
        (\"Hosted Service\").\n\n(c) \"Gemma\" means the set of machine learning language

        (ii) works based on Gemma, or (iii) any other machine learning model which
        is created by transfer of patterns of the weights, parameters, operations,
        or Output of Gemma, to that model in order to cause that model to perform
        similarly to Gemma, including distillation methods that use intermediate data
        representations or methods based on the generation of synthetic data Outputs
        by Gemma for training that model. For clarity, Outputs are not deemed Model
        Derivatives.\n\n(f) \"Output\" means the information content output of Gemma
