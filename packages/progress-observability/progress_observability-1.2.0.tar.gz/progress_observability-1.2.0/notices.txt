  "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object form,
  that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the editorial
  revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications represent, as a
  whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes of this License,
  Derivative Works shall not include works that remain separable from, or
  merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of, the Work and Derivative
  Works thereof.

  "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including the original
  version of the Work and any modifications or additions to that Work or
  Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally submitted to Licensor for
  inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner or by an individual or Legal
  Entity authorized to submit on behalf of the copyright owner. For the
  purposes of this definition, "submitted" means any form of electronic,
  verbal, or written communication sent to the Licensor or its representatives,
  including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists,
  source code control systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by,
  or on behalf of, the Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the
  Work, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
  designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

  "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity on
  behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and subsequently
  incorporated within the Work.

  2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
  License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
  non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable copyright license to
  reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of, publicly display, publicly perform,
  sublicense, and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or
  Object form.

  3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
  License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual, worldwide,
  non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable (except as stated in this
  section) patent license to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell, import,
  and otherwise transfer the Work, where such license applies only to those
  patent claims licensable by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed
  by their Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
  with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You institute
  patent litigation against any entity (including a cross-claim or counterclaim
  in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work or a Contribution incorporated within
  the Work constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then any
  patent licenses granted to You under this License for that Work shall
  terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

  4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or
  Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without modifications, and in
  Source or Object form, provided that You meet the following conditions:

    a. You must give any other recipients of the Work or Derivative Works a
    copy of
      this License; and

    b. You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices stating that
      You changed the files; and

    c. You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works that You
      distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices
      from the Source form of the Work, excluding those notices that do not
      pertain to any part of the Derivative Works; and

    d. If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its distribution,
    then
      any Derivative Works that You distribute must include a readable copy of
      the attribution notices contained within such NOTICE file, excluding
      those notices that do not pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in
      at least one of the following places: within a NOTICE text file
      distributed as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
      documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or, within a
      display generated by the Derivative Works, if and wherever such
      third-party notices normally appear. The contents of the NOTICE file are
      for informational purposes only and do not modify the License. You may
      add Your own attribution notices within Derivative Works that You
      distribute, alongside or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work,
      provided that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed as
      modifying the License.

  You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may
  provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use,
  reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or for any such
  Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use, reproduction, and
  distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in
  this License.

  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise, any
  Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work by You to the
  Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of this License, without any
  additional terms or conditions. Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein
  shall supersede or modify the terms of any separate license agreement you may
  have executed with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
  trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor, except as
  required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
  Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or agreed to in
  writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each Contributor provides its
  Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY
  KIND, either express or implied, including, without limitation, any
  warranties or conditions of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or
  FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
  the appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any risks
  associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory, whether in
  tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, unless required by
  applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly negligent acts) or agreed to
  in writing, shall any Contributor be liable to You for damages, including any
  direct, indirect, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any
  character arising as a result of this License or out of the use or inability
  to use the Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
  work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
  commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor has been advised of
  the possibility of such damages.

  9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing the Work
  or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer, and charge a fee for,
  acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity, or other liability obligations
  and/or rights consistent with this License. However, in accepting such
  obligations, You may act only on Your own behalf and on Your sole
  responsibility, not on behalf of any other Contributor, and only if You agree
  to indemnify, defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
  incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason of your
  accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

(33) Python Software Foundation License 2.0:

Progress Observability Platform Python Instrumentation 1.1.1 incorporates
aiohappyeyeballs 2.6.1 and python-typing-extensions 4.14.1.

  This license was approved as the official PSF License Version 2 on October
  22, 2004. The only differences between this and version 1 of the PSF license
  consist of removing Python version numbers (like 2.1.1 or 2.3).



  PYTHON SOFTWARE FOUNDATION LICENSE VERSION 2
  ============================================

  --------------------------------------------

    1.  This LICENSE AGREEMENT is between the Python Software Foundation
    ("PSF"),
      and the Individual or Organization ("Licensee") accessing and otherwise
      using this software ("Python") in source or binary form and its
      associated documentation.

    2.  Subject to the terms and conditions of this License Agreement, PSF
    hereby
      grants Licensee a nonexclusive, royalty-free, world-wide license to
      reproduce, analyze, test, perform and/or display publicly, prepare
      derivative works, distribute, and otherwise use Python alone or in any
      derivative version, provided, however, that PSF's License Agreement and
      PSF's notice of copyright, i.e., "Copyright (c) 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004
      Python Software Foundation; All Rights Reserved" are retained in Python
      alone or in any derivative version prepared by Licensee.

    3. In the event Licensee prepares a derivative work that is based on or
      incorporates Python or any part thereof, and wants to make the derivative
      work available to others as provided herein, then Licensee hereby agrees
      to include in any such work a brief summary of the changes made to Python.

    4.  PSF is making Python available to Licensee on an "AS IS" basis. PSF
    MAKES
      NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. BY WAY OF EXAMPLE,
      BUT NOT LIMITATION, PSF MAKES NO AND DISCLAIMS ANY REPRESENTATION OR
      WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR THAT
      THE USE OF PYTHON WILL NOT INFRINGE ANY THIRD PARTY RIGHTS.

    5.  PSF SHALL NOT BE LIABLE TO LICENSEE OR ANY OTHER USERS OF PYTHON FOR ANY
      INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OR LOSS AS A RESULT OF
      MODIFYING, DISTRIBUTING, OR OTHERWISE USING PYTHON, OR ANY DERIVATIVE
      THEREOF, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY THEREOF.

    6.  This License Agreement will automatically terminate upon a material
    breach
      of its terms and conditions.

    7.  Nothing in this License Agreement shall be deemed to create any
      relationship of agency, partnership, or joint venture between PSF and
      Licensee. This License Agreement does not grant permission to use PSF
      trademarks or trade name in a trademark sense to endorse or promote
      products or services of Licensee, or any third party.

    8.  By copying, installing or otherwise using Python, Licensee agrees to be
      bound by the terms and conditions of this License Agreement.
