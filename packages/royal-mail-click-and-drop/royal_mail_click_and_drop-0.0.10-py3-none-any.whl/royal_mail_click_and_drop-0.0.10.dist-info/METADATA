A basic client for interacting with the Royal Mail Click and Drop API.

Most of the code is auto generated by OpenAPI Generator from the OpenAPI spec available at https://api.parcel.royalmail.com/.

However the generated code is verbose and not very user friendly, so this package provides a simplified client interface, as well as some normalisation to work with [Shipaw](https://github.com/pawrequest/shipaw/tree/v3).

See [Generated README](README_AUTO.md)

NOTE: This package is in early development and the API is subject to change.
