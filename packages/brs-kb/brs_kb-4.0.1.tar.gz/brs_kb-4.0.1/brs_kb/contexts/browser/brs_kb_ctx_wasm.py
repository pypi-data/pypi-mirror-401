    "description": """
WebAssembly (WASM) is used for high-performance web applications. While WASM itself is sandboxed and
cannot directly access the DOM, XSS vulnerabilities can occur when WASM modules interact with JavaScript
through imports/exports, especially when processing user input or generating dynamic content.

SEVERITY: MEDIUM to HIGH
Emerging threat as WASM adoption increases. Complex attack surface.
""",
    "attack_vector": """
WASM EXPORTING STRINGS TO JAVASCRIPT:
WasmModule.exports.getUserData() returns raw HTML
JavaScript inserts via innerHTML without sanitization

MEMORY CORRUPTION TO JAVASCRIPT:
Buffer overflow in WASM leading to JavaScript string injection

TYPE CONFUSION:
Between WASM and JavaScript causing unexpected data in DOM

WASM-GENERATED CODE:
WASM generating SQL or template code executed in JavaScript

UNSAFE STRING HANDLING:
C/C++/Rust code compiled to WASM with unsafe string operations

JAVASCRIPT GLUE CODE:
Emscripten-generated code with eval() or Function()

WASM LOADING USER DATA:
Passing unsanitized user input to dangerous JS APIs

BUFFER OVERFLOWS:
Leading to JavaScript heap manipulation

PROTOTYPE POLLUTION:
Via WASM-JS boundary
""",
    "remediation": """
DEFENSE:

1. TREAT WASM OUTPUTS AS UNTRUSTED
   Apply same XSS protections as regular user input

2. SANITIZE WASM-GENERATED CONTENT
   Validate and encode WASM strings before DOM use

3. USE SAFE APIS
   textContent instead of innerHTML for WASM output

4. MEMORY-SAFE LANGUAGES
   Use Rust (borrow checker) or AssemblyScript over C/C++

5. BOUNDS CHECKING
   Implement in WASM code

6. VALIDATE AT WASM-JS BOUNDARY
   Check data types and structures

7. CSP CONFIGURATION
   Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'wasm-unsafe-eval'
   Control carefully

8. AUDIT GLUE CODE
   Review emscripten or wasm-bindgen generated code

9. KEEP TOOLCHAINS UPDATED

10. INPUT VALIDATION
    Before passing data to WASM

Example:
// WASM exports function that returns user data
const userData = wasmModule.getUserData();

// BAD:
element.innerHTML = userData;

// GOOD:
element.textContent = userData;
// OR
element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userData);

TOOLS:
- WASM security analyzers
- Memory sanitizers (ASan, MSan)
- Fuzzing tools for WASM
