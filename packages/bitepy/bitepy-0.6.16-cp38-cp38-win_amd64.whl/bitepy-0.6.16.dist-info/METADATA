A Python high-frequency intraday trading engine for simulating the rolling intrinsic strategy on the European market, solved as a dynamic program. See our paper (tbd, Schaurecker & Wozabal et al. (2025)) for details on the method and visualizations of the results.


## Features

- Process your own raw EPEX Spot Market Data to a suitable format
- Define battery and simulation settings
- Adapt the parameters of the dynamic programming optimization
- React to every single LOB update on the exchange
- Run yearly high-frequency trading simulations in minutes/hours
- Return and visualize results and statistics

## Installation

BitePy requires Python 3.8+ to run.
The package is hosted on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/bitepy/) and can be easily installed via

```sh
pip install bitepy
```

## Documentation and Tutorial

Our [Documentation](https://dschaurecker.github.io/bitepy/) gives a detailed overview on our package's features and will be updated continuously. We also provide a simple [Tutorial](https://github.com/dschaurecker/bitepy/blob/main/notebooks/package_tutorial.ipynb) in form of a Jupyter Notebook, guiding users through our simulation process.

## Contribution

We are happy about all forms of feedback and would like to hear from you, if you would like to contribute as well, or are interested in the underlying C++ source code of your simulation engine.
If you want to clone and contribute to the repository, first `pip install bitepy` and then clone the repository to have access to the compiled binaries while being able to edit the Python source code.
