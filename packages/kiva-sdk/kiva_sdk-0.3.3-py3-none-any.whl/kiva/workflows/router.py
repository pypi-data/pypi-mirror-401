"""Router Workflow - routes to a single worker agent for simple tasks.

This workflow is designed for straightforward tasks that can be handled by
a single agent. It selects the most appropriate agent from the available
pool and delegates the entire task to that agent.

Use cases:
    - Simple Q&A tasks
    - Single-domain queries
    - Tasks with clear, unambiguous requirements
