# ExpOps User Guide

Welcome to the ExpOps user guide! ExpOps is a project-based experiment runner that keeps each experiment isolated under a workspace, runs pipelines, and saves run artifacts with optional tracking/backends.

## What is ExpOps?

`expops` is a comprehensive MLOps platform designed to help you manage machine learning experiments efficiently. It provides:

- **Project-Based Workflow**: Each ML project is isolated in its own workspace with independent configurations, dependencies, and artifacts
- **DAG Pipeline Execution**: Define complex ML pipelines as directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) using NetworkX
- **Distributed Computing**: Execute pipelines on clusters using Dask (with SLURM support) or run locally
- **Environment Isolation**: Automatic virtual environment management (venv/conda)
- **Caching & Reproducibility**: Intelligent step-level caching with configurable backends
- **Static & Dynamic Reporting**: Generate static charts (PNG) and interactive dynamic charts

## Quick Start

Get started with ExpOps in minutes:

```bash
pip install expops
mkdir -p ~/expops-workspace && cd ~/expops-workspace
expops create sklearn-basic --template sklearn-basic
expops run sklearn-basic --local
```
