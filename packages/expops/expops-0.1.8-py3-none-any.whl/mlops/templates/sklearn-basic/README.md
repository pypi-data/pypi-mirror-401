# Template: `sklearn-basic`

This is a minimal runnable template for **ExpOps** that uses the **custom** adapter (your code),
but trains a tiny **scikit-learn** model inside `models/model.py`.

What it includes:
- `configs/project_config.yaml`: config with a `{{PROJECT_ID}}` placeholder (filled automatically)
- `data/train.csv`: tiny dataset with a required `label` column
- `models/model.py`: defines `train_model` and `evaluate_model` processes
- `charts/plot_metrics.py`: basic matplotlib report (generates PNGs)
- `requirements.txt` and `charts/requirements.txt`

Run it via the CLI:

```bash
expops create my-project --template sklearn-basic
expops run my-project
```

After the run, look under:
- `projects/<id>/artifacts/charts/<run-id>/plot_metrics/.../*.png` (generated by the chart node)
