conditions stated below.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, MODIFICATION, AND DISTRIBUTION

0. Definitions.

   "This License" refers to version 1.0 of the FluxHive Agent 
   Non-Commercial Copyleft License.

   "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
   License. Each licensee is addressed as "you". "Licensees" and
   "recipients" may be individuals or organizations.

   To "modify" a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
   in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of
   an exact copy. The resulting work is called a "modified version" of
   the earlier work or a work "based on" the earlier work.

   A "covered work" means either the unmodified Program or a work based
   on the Program.

   To "propagate" a work means to do anything with it that, without
   permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable for
   infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
   computer or modifying a private copy. Propagation includes copying,
   distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
   public, and in some countries other activities as well.

   To "convey" a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
   parties to make or receive copies. Mere interaction with a user through
   a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.

1. Non-Commercial Use Restriction.

   You may use, copy, modify, and distribute the Program and any
   derivative works based on it ONLY for non-commercial purposes.
   
   "Commercial purposes" means any use that is intended for or directed
   toward commercial advantage or monetary compensation, including but
   not limited to:
   - Selling, licensing, or otherwise monetizing the Program or
     derivative works
   - Using the Program or derivative works in a commercial product or
     service
   - Using the Program or derivative works to provide commercial services
   - Any other use that generates revenue or commercial value

   For commercial use, you must obtain a separate commercial license from
   the copyright holder.

2. Source Code Availability (Copyleft).

   If you modify the Program or create derivative works based on it, you
   MUST make the complete source code of your modifications and derivative
   works available to the public under this same License. You may NOT
   distribute modified versions or derivative works under a different
   license or as proprietary software.

   When you convey a covered work, you must:
   a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
      code, which must be distributed under the terms of this License
   b) Include a prominent notice stating that the work is modified and
      indicating the date of modification
   c) Retain all copyright notices from the original Program
   d) Include a copy of this License

3. Redistribution Requirements.

   You may redistribute the Program in source or binary form, provided
   that you:
   a) Include the original copyright notice and this License
   b) Include a copy of this License with every copy of the Program
   c) If you distribute binary forms, include the complete source code
      or provide a written offer to provide the source code
   d) Clearly indicate any changes you made to the Program

4. No Warranty.

   THE PROGRAM IS PROVIDED "AS IS", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,
   EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF
   MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
   IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY
   CLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,
   TORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE
   PROGRAM OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE PROGRAM.

5. Termination.

   Your rights under this License will terminate automatically if you
   fail to comply with any of its terms. However, if you cease all
   violation of this License, then your license from a particular
   copyright holder is reinstated provisionally, unless and until the
   copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license.

6. Patents.

   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
   patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
   make, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise run, modify and
   propagate the contents of its contributor version.

7. No Endorsement.

   This License does not grant permission to use the trade names,
   trademarks, service marks, or product names of the copyright holder,
   except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
   origin of the Program.

8. Governing Law.

   This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with
   applicable copyright laws.
