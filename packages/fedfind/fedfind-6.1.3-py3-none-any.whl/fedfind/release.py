    """Function to return an appropriate Release subclass for the
    version information. Figures out if you want a nightly, compose,
    milestone, or stable release and gives it to you. Catches some
    nonsense choices. Tries to figure out the appropriate subclass
    (current, archive, core...) for stable releases. Can work off
    fedfind/wikitcms-style 'release, milestone, compose, respin, dist',
    or from a compose URL (expected to be the URL available from
    releng fedmsgs - the /compose directory of a Pungi 4 compose),
    or from a Pungi 4 compose ID, or from a Pungi 4 compose label.
    Yeah, that's a lot of choice.

    Priority goes to url, then label, then cid, then r/m/c/r/d. So if
    url is specified, all other values are ignored; if url is not
    specified but label is, label is used and all other values except
    release are ignored; if neither url nor label is specified but
    cid is, cid is used and all other values are ignored; if none of
    url, label, or cid is specified, we do what we can with whatever
    release, milestone, compose and respin values are given. Note
    if you pass label you probably also want to pass release; labels
    identify only milestone and compose. If you don't, it will be
    guessed. By default, if you pass 'cid', we do not try to 'promote'
    the result - that is, if the compose in question is a production
    compose and was actually synced out as a Candidate or released as
    a Milestone or a stable release, we do not discover its label and
    give you one of those instances based on the label, you just get
    a Production, which is the compose's expected location in the non-
    mirrored kojipkgs server where *all* Pungi 4 composes initially
    appear. If you want to 'promote' from the cid in this way, pass
    promote=True.

    Not all values are sanity checked; this may return a non-plausible
    release. Specifically, we do not check the sanity of milestone or
    compose values. An insane milestone value might be silently turned
    into a sane one, depending on other values; an insane compose
    value is likely to result in either an exception or a non-
    plausible release. Of course this function may also return a
    release that does not exist, and this is desired in some cases.

    Note that if all version values are left unset, you will get the
    current date's most recent RawhideNightly if there is one, or
    else you will get a non-existent RawhideNightly for today's date
    with respin 0. Also note that either release or milestone being
    set to Rawhide will always result in a RawhideNightly; this is to
    ensure compatibility with wikitcms, where Rawhide compose events
    are versioned as e.g. 23 Rawhide 20150304. Wikitcms similarly
    tries to handle fedfind release values (by guessing a release
    number for a version like Rawhide '' 20150304 0), so usually,
    fedfind and wikitcms versions are transparently interchangeable.

    For nightlies, pass compose as 'YYYYMMDD'. You'll wind up with
    either a Rawhide, Branched, Cloud, Container, IoT, Updates or
    Updates-testing nightly, depending on dist, release and milestone.
    If you set "Fedora" dist and a valid release number and leave
    milestone unset, you'll get BranchedNightly. You can never get
    anything else by nightly detection, you must specify it via dist,
    milestone, cid or url. If you set a valid release number and a
    valid nightly milestone or dist, you'll get what you asked for.
    For any other case you'll wind up with RawhideNightly.

    At present the interesting values for dist are 'Fedora' (the
    default), 'Fedora-Cloud', 'Fedora-Container' and 'Fedora-IoT'.
    Fedora' is the default and will give you 'mainstream' composes.
    The other dists give you the Container and IoT nightly composes
    respectively.

    If you set a nightly type milestone and leave compose unset, we
    will use today's date as the compose. For all cases, if you
    specify respin, you'll get an instance with that respin, whether
    it exists or not. If you don't specify it, fedfind will try to
    find the latest completed compose for the release, milestone and
    date given or guessed and return that; if there aren't any, it
    will return an instance for 'respin 0' for that date.

    For candidates, you must specify a valid milestone and compose. If
    you don't specify release, we'll try and find out what the
    current Branched is, and use that. If you don't specify a
    milestone, we'll raise ValueError.

    For milestone releases (Alpha/Beta), specify the milestone. We
    will guess the release in the same way as for candidates if it is
    not passed. Note that milestone 'RC' / 'Final' will be treated the
    same way as no milestone at all, i.e. returning a stable release.

    For stable releases, specify the release. You may specify
    milestone 'Final' but it is not necessary. There is no release
    guessing for stable releases.
