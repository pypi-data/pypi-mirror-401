    Useful for timelapse data, z-stacks, multi-channel images, or any multi-dimensional

    Attributes:
        operations: List of ImageOperation instances to apply in sequence.
        max_workers: Maximum number of worker threads for parallel processing. If None,

    Note:
        Uses thread-based parallelism, which is most effective for operations that release
        the GIL (like numpy operations). Pure Python operations may not benefit from
        parallelization due to the Global Interpreter Lock.
