    let long_text = "Quantum computing is a rapidly-emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers. While traditional computers use bits as the smallest unit of data, quantum computers use quantum bits or qubits. Qubits can represent numerous possible combinations of 1 and 0 at the same time through a property called superposition. This allows quantum computers to consider and manipulate many combinations of information simultaneously, making them well suited to specific types of complex calculations. Another key property of quantum computing is entanglement, which allows qubits that are separated by great distances to still be connected. Changing the state of one entangled qubit will instantaneously change the state of its partner regardless of how far apart they are. Quantum computers excel at solving certain types of problems, such as factoring very large numbers, searching unsorted databases, and simulating quantum systems like molecules for drug development. However, they are not expected to replace classical computers for most everyday tasks. Major technology companies including IBM, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, and several startups are racing to build practical quantum computers. In 2019, Google claimed to have achieved quantum supremacy, performing a calculation that would be practically impossible for a classical computer. While current quantum computers are still limited by high error rates and the need for extreme cooling, they represent one of the most promising frontier technologies of the 21st century.";
