ExplainThisRepo is a CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that automatically generates plain-English explanations of GitHub repositories. It's designed to help developers quickly understand what any public GitHub repository does by analyzing its contents and creating an `EXPLAIN.md` file.

## 📦 Installation

Requirements: Python 3.9+

## Option 1: You can install via pip (recommended):

```bash
pip install explainthisrepo
```

## Option 2: Install with pipx
```bash
pipx install explainthisrepo
```

---

## 🧪 Usage

```bash
explainthisrepo owner/repo
```

## 🧾 Example
```bash
explainthisrepo facebook/react
```
This generates:

`EXPLAIN.md`

Open the file in your editor to read the explanation

---

## ⚙️ Quickstart

```bash
pip install explainthisrepo
explainthisrepo owner/repo
```

## 🔑 Configuration

ExplainThisRepo uses Gemini.

Set your API key as an environment variable.

macOS / Linux

```linux
export GEMINI_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"
```

Windows (PowerShell)

```powershell
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your_api_key_here"
```

Restart your terminal after setting the key.

## Termux (Android) install notes

Termux has some environment limitations that can make `pip install explainthisrepo` fail to create the `explainthisrepo` command in `$PREFIX/bin`.

### Recommended install (Termux)

```bash
pip install --user -U explainthisrepo
```

Make sure your user bin directory is on your PATH:
```bash
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```
> Tip: Add the PATH export to your ~/.bashrc or ~/.zshrc so it persists.

Alternative (No PATH changes)

If you do not want to modify PATH, you can run ExplainThisRepo as a module:

```bash
python -m explain_this_repo owner/repo
```

Gemini support on Termux (Optional)

Installing Gemini support may require building Rust-based dependencies on Android, which can take time on first install:

```bash
pip install --user -U "explainthisrepo[gemini]"
```
