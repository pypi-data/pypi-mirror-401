    Create OME-Zarr plate from MD Image Xpress files.

    This is a non-parallel task => it parses the metadata, creates the plates
    and then converts all the wells in the same process

    Args:
        zarr_dir: path of the directory where the new OME-Zarrs will be
            created.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        acquisitions: List of acquisition directories to convert to OME-Zarr. If
            you are processing multiplexing experiments, name the plate the
            same for all acquisitions, but give them unique acquisition IDs.
            If you are processing multiple separate plates, give the plates
            unique names.
        mode: Choose conversion mode. Choose whether you have 3D data
            (StackAcquisition), 2D data (Single Plane Acquisition) or mixed
            (Mixed Acquisition).
        tile_alignment: Choose whether tiles are placed into the OME-Zarr as a
            grid or whether they are placed based on the position of field of
            views in the metadata (using fusion for shared areas).
        layout: Plate layout for the Zarr file. Valid options are 96 and 384
        order_name: Name of the order
        num_levels: Number of pyramid levels to build in an OME-Zarr. More
            levels are useful for large plates to allow easier plate
            visualization, but will also lead to more files being created.
        barcode: Barcode of the plate
        reset_plates: Whether to remove any potentially pre-existing OME-Zarr
            plates before conversion.
        binning: Binning factor to downsample the original image. If set to 2,
            an image that is 2x2 downsampled in xy will be produced.
        parallelize: The automatic distribute.Client option often fails to
            finish when running the task locally. Set parallelize to false to
            avoid that.
