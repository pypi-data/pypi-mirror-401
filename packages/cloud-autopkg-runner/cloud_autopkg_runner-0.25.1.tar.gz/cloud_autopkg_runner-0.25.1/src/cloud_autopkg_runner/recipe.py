"""Module for handling AutoPkg recipe processing in cloud-autopkg-runner.

This module defines classes and functions for representing, parsing,
and processing AutoPkg recipes. It provides tools for extracting
information from recipes, generating lists of recipes, and performing
other recipe-related operations.

Key classes:
- `Recipe`: Represents an AutoPkg recipe and provides methods for accessing
  recipe metadata, parsing the recipe contents, running the recipe, and
  managing trust information.
