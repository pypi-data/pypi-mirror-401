"""Configuration schema definitions.

This module defines the canonical configuration schema for
cloud-autopkg-runner. The schema represents the complete set of
supported configuration options, their types, and default values.

The schema is intentionally immutable and side-effect free. It is
used as an intermediate representation between raw configuration
data (files, CLI, environment) and validated runtime settings.
