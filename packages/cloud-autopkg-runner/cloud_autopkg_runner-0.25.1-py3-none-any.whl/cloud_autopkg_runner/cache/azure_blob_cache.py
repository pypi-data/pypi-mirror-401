"""Module for managing a metadata cache stored in an Azure Blob Storage container.

This module provides an asynchronous implementation of a metadata cache that
stores data in an Azure Blob Storage container. It uses a singleton pattern to ensure
that only one instance of the cache is created and provides methods for loading,
saving, getting, setting, and deleting cache items. The cache is thread-safe, using
an asyncio lock to prevent race conditions.
