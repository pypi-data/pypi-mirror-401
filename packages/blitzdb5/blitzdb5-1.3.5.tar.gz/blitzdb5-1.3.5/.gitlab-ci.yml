# This file defines the GitLab CI/CD pipeline for building and publishing
# a Python package to PyPI.

# Use a specific, stable Python image
image: python:3.12

# Define the stages of the pipeline
stages:
  - build
  - publish

# Define artifacts path for caching dependencies
variables:
  PIP_CACHE_DIR: "$CI_PROJECT_DIR/.pip-cache"

cache:
  paths:
    - .pip-cache/

# -----------------
# 1. BUILD STAGE
# Creates the distributable files (.whl and .tar.gz)
# -----------------
build_package:
  stage: build
  before_script:
    - git fetch --tags
  script:
    - echo "--- Installing build tools ---"
    - pip install --upgrade pip
    - pip install build
    
    - echo "--- Building distribution archives ---"
    # Execute the build process which creates files in the 'dist/' directory
    - python -m build
    
    - echo "--- Listing generated artifacts ---"
    - ls -l dist/

  # Store the contents of the dist/ folder so they can be passed to the next stage
  artifacts:
    paths:
      - dist/
    expire_in: 1 week

# -----------------
# 3. PUBLISH STAGE
# Uploads the built package to PyPI using Twine.
# -----------------
publish_to_pypi:
  stage: publish
  
  # Set authentication credentials as environment variables
  variables:
    TWINE_USERNAME: __token__
    TWINE_PASSWORD: $PYPI_TOKEN
  
  # This job will only run when a new tag is created (e.g., git tag v0.1.0)
  # This ensures releases are intentional and versioned.
  rules:
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_TAG
      when: always
      
  # Ensure twine is installed before running the upload script
  before_script:
    - echo "--- Installing Twine for secure uploading ---"
    - pip install twine

  script:

    - echo "--- Authenticating and uploading distribution archives to PyPI ---"
    - python -m twine upload --non-interactive --verbose dist/*
