    treated when generating code:
     * `@declare_constraint` if the Require represents a constraint that can be declared in LQP.
     * `@discharge` if the Require represents a constraint that should be dismissed during
       code generation. Namely, when it cannot be declared in LQP and uses one of the
       `unique`, `exclusive`, `anyof` builtins. These nodes are removed from the IR model
