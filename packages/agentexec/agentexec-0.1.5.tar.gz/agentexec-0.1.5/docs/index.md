# agentexec

**Production-ready task orchestration for OpenAI Agents SDK**

agentexec is a Python library that provides robust, scalable infrastructure for running AI agents in production environments. It combines Redis-backed task queues, multi-process worker pools, and comprehensive activity tracking to make deploying and monitoring AI agents straightforward and reliable.

## Key Features

- **Multi-Process Worker Pool** - Spawn N worker processes that poll a Redis queue and execute tasks in parallel
- **Redis Task Queue** - Reliable job distribution with priority support (HIGH/LOW)
- **Automatic Activity Tracking** - Full lifecycle management (QUEUED → RUNNING → COMPLETE/ERROR) with progress logging
- **OpenAI Agents Integration** - Drop-in runner with max turns recovery and status reporting
- **Agent Self-Reporting** - Built-in tools for agents to report progress during execution
- **Type-Safe Contexts** - Pydantic BaseModel for task context with IDE autocomplete
- **Graceful Shutdown** - Timeout-based worker shutdown with signal handling
- **Pipelines** - Multi-step workflow orchestration with parallel task execution
- **Result Storage** - Results cached in Redis with configurable TTL for pipeline coordination

## Why agentexec?

Building production AI agent systems requires more than just calling an LLM API. You need:

- **Reliable task execution** - Tasks should survive process restarts and be retried on failure
- **Observability** - Know what your agents are doing, when they started, and how they're progressing
- **Scalability** - Run multiple agents in parallel across multiple worker processes
- **Type safety** - Catch errors at development time, not in production
- **Graceful degradation** - Handle failures without bringing down your entire system

agentexec provides all of this out of the box, letting you focus on building your agents rather than infrastructure.

## Quick Example

```python
from uuid import UUID
from pydantic import BaseModel
from agents import Agent
import agentexec as ax

# Define input and output schemas
class ResearchContext(BaseModel):
    company: str
    focus_areas: list[str]

class ResearchResult(BaseModel):
    summary: str
    insights: list[str]

# Create a worker pool
pool = ax.Pool(engine=engine)

# Register a task
@pool.task("research_company")
async def research_company(agent_id: UUID, context: ResearchContext) -> ResearchResult:
    runner = ax.OpenAIRunner(agent_id=agent_id)

    agent = Agent(
        name="Research Agent",
        instructions=(
            f"Research {context.company} focusing on {context.focus_areas}"
            f"{runner.prompts.report_status}"
        ),
        tools=[runner.tools.report_status],
        model="gpt-5",
        output_type=ResearchResult,
    )

    result = await runner.run(agent, input="Begin research", max_turns=15)
    return result.final_output_as(ResearchResult)

# Start workers
pool.run()

# Queue a task (from anywhere in your app)
task = await ax.enqueue("research_company", ResearchContext(
    company="Anthropic",
    focus_areas=["AI safety", "product offerings"]
))
result = await ax.get_result(task)
```
