# The default 350 sec timeout was determined by finding the upper bound for the majority of tests.
# There exist other unit tests which take up more time than 350 sec,
# so @pytest.mark.timeout decorators are used to override the default timeout.
# Setting to 450 since tests are slower on Windows
timeout = 450
