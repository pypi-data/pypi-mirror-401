# pyrri

Client library for the DENIC real-time registration interface RRI

## Install

```
pip install pyrri
```

## Quickstart

Make sure your clients IP address is allowed to access RRI.
See [DENIC RRI IP Allowlisting](https://docs.denic.de/en/Content/DENIC-29/IP%20Allowlisting.htm) for more information.

```
from rri import RRIClient


rri = RRIClient()
rri.connect("rri.denic.de", 51131)
rri.login(username, password)

order = """
Version: 5.0
Action: INFO
DOMAIN: denic.de
Recursive: false
""".strip()

answer = rri.talk(order)

rri.logout()
rri.disconnect()
```

`order` can be `k/v` or `xml` formatted.
See [Examples section in DENIC manual](https://docs.denic.de/en/Content/Beispiele/50/Overview-Beispiele.htm) for more information about what is expected.

```
rri --help
```

```

  -i, --input INPUT     Filename with order to send to RRI. When skipping this parameter,
                        the order is read from stdin (default: None)

                        parameter, answer is written to stdout (default: None)
