The `docker-best-practices` skill is designed to be integrated into the **Continuous Integration (CI)** phase of a pipeline. When a developer pushes code, this skill's logic should be triggered to analyze the proposed Dockerfile for security vulnerabilities and optimization opportunities. It accepts shell scripts as entrypoint templates and produces optimized Docker images as output.

Downstream, this skill integrates seamlessly with **Kubernetes (Orchestration)**. By ensuring that images include resource constraints and health check metadata (HEALTHCHECK), it enables Kubernetes controllers to manage container lifecycles more effectively. It also complements **IaC (Infrastructure-as-Code)** tools by providing the registry paths and tags for the hardened images that the infrastructure will deploy.
