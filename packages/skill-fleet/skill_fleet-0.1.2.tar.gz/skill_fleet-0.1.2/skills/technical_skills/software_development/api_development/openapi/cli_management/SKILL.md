# OpenAPI CLI Management

## Overview

OpenAPI CLI Management is the practice of treating your API specification as a first-class software artifact. Instead of relying on manual GUI editors, this workflow utilizes command-line tools to enforce standards, manage complexity through modularization, and provide immediate utility to developers via documentation and mocking.

**Core principle:** The API specification is the "Single Source of Truth." If the CLI cannot validate it, the API does not exist.

## When to Use

**Use when:**
- You are following an "API Design-First" approach.
- Your OpenAPI specification has grown too large to manage in a single file.
- You need to enforce organizational style guides (e.g., "All endpoints must have a 401 response").
- You want to break the build in CI/CD if the API documentation is incomplete or invalid.
- Frontend and backend teams need to work in parallel using a mock server.

**When NOT to use:**
- You are doing "Code-First" development where the spec is auto-generated from backend decorators (e.g., SpringDoc, FastAPI) and never manually edited.
- You are maintaining a tiny, single-endpoint API where the overhead of CLI tools exceeds the benefit.

## Quick Reference

| Problem | Solution | Keywords |
| ------- | -------- | -------- |
| Spec is messy/inconsistent | `spectral lint` | Linting, Governance, Style |
| Spec is too large/unwieldy | `redocly bundle` | Bundling, $ref, Modularity |
| Frontend needs a backend | `prism mock` | Mocking, Virtualization |
| Outdated/Manual docs | `redocly build-docs` | Documentation as Code, ReDoc |
| Manual CI/CD checks | GitHub Actions / GitLab CI | Automation, Quality Gates |

## Core Patterns

### 1. Automated Governance (Spectral)

**The problem:** Different developers write specs differently. One uses `camelCase`, another `snake_case`. Some forget to add security schemes or descriptions.

**✅ Production pattern:**
Use **Spectral** with a custom ruleset (`.spectral.yaml`) to enforce organizational standards automatically.

```yaml
# .spectral.yaml
extends: ["spectral:oas", "spectral:runtime"]
rules:
  # Enforce kebab-case for paths
  paths-kebab-case:
    description: All paths must be kebab-case.
    given: $.paths[*]~
    then:
      function: pattern
      functionOptions:
        match: "^(/[a-z0-9-]+)+$"
  # Ensure every operation has a summary
  operation-summary-required:
    recommended: true
    given: $.paths.*[get,post,put,delete,patch]
    then:
      field: summary
      function: truthy
```

### 2. Multi-file Project Management (Redocly)

**The problem:** A 5,000-line `openapi.yaml` is impossible to maintain. Git conflicts are frequent, and readability is low.

**✅ Production pattern:**
Split the spec into a folder structure and use `redocly bundle` to create a distribution file.

```text
task-manager-api/
├── openapi.yaml          # Root file
├── paths/
│   ├── tasks.yaml        # Endpoints related to tasks
│   └── users.yaml
└── components/
    ├── schemas/
    │   ├── Task.yaml     # Reusable Data Model
    │   └── Error.yaml
```

**Bundle command:**
```bash
# Merges all $ref files into a single, valid OpenAPI file
redocly bundle openapi.yaml --output dist/openapi.json
```

### 3. Contract-Driven Mocking (Prism)

**The problem:** The frontend team is blocked because the backend implementation isn't finished.

**✅ Production pattern:**
Run a **Prism** mock server directly from the spec. Prism validates incoming requests and generates responses based on your examples.

```bash
# Start a mock server on localhost:4010
prism mock task-manager-api/openapi.yaml
```

**Testing different scenarios:**
```bash
# Force a 404 response to test error handling
curl http://127.0.0.1:4010/tasks/999 -H "Prefer: code=404"
```

### 4. Documentation as Code (Redocly)

**The problem:** API documentation is often a PDF or a manual Wiki page that is out of sync with the actual API.

**✅ Production pattern:**
Generate documentation automatically from the source of truth whenever the spec changes.

```bash
# Generate a zero-dependency HTML file
redocly build-docs openapi.yaml --output=index.html
```

**Key insight:** By including this in your build process, your "Docs" and your "Code" can never diverge.

### 5. CI/CD Integration Patterns (GitHub Actions)

**The problem:** Human error. A developer pushes a change that breaks the spec, but it isn't caught until someone tries to use it.

**✅ Production pattern:**
Automate linting and bundling in your CI/CD pipeline to ensure every Pull Request is valid.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/api-lint.yml
name: API Validation
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v3
      
      - name: Install Dependencies
        run: npm ci
      
      - name: Lint Specification
        run: npx spectral lint openapi.yaml --fail-severity=warn
        
      - name: Bundle and Validate
        run: npx redocly bundle openapi.yaml --output dist/openapi.json
        
      - name: Archive Production Spec
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
        with:
          name: bundled-spec
          path: dist/openapi.json
```

## Common Mistakes

| Mistake | Why It's Wrong | Fix |
| ------- | -------------- | --- |
| Not versioning CLI tools | Different versions of Spectral may have different default rules. | Use `package.json` to lock tool versions via NPM/Yarn. |
| Hardcoding examples in code | The mock server becomes a "dumb" JSON server rather than a contract validator. | Put rich `example` objects in the OpenAPI spec. |
| Bundling too early | Developers often bundle and then edit the bundle, losing the source changes. | Only bundle as a build step; always edit the source fragments. |
| Ignoring linting warnings | "Warnings" often point to future breaking changes or security gaps. | Set `fail-on-warnings: true` in CI for production-grade APIs. |

## Red Flags

- Your `openapi.yaml` is over 2,000 lines. (Refactor into modules).
- You find yourself telling a colleague "just ignore the validation error in the editor."
- You have to manually update a "mock server" separate from the OpenAPI file.
- Your CI/CD pipeline passes even when the API spec is missing descriptions for new fields.

## Validation

```bash
# Validate the skill logic (conceptual)
# Check if spectral and redocly are installed and accessible
spectral --version
redocly --version
prism --version
```
