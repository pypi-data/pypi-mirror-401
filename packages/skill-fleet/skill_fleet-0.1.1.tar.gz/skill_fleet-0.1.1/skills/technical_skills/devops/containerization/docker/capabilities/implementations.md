[{'name': 'multi_stage_build_optimization', 'content': "Uses a programmatic approach to analyze Dockerfiles and suggest multi-stage splits. It identifies build tools (compilers, headers) that are present in the final image and recommends moving them to a 'builder' stage, ensuring the final artifact contains only the runtime binary and necessary libraries."}, {'name': 'container_security_hardening', 'content': 'Ensures the `USER` directive is present and non-root. It also validates that sensitive files are excluded via `.dockerignore` and that secrets are injected via `docker build --secret` or environment variables rather than being baked into image layers.'}, {'name': 'docker_resource_management', 'content': 'Provides a validation schema for Docker Compose and Kubernetes manifests to ensure that `limits` and `requests` for CPU and Memory are explicitly defined, preventing containers from consuming unbounded host resources.'}, {'name': 'image_layer_analysis', 'content': "Wraps tools like `dive` or uses the Docker API to calculate the 'efficiency score' of an image. It flags layers that add large files only to delete them in subsequent layers, suggesting the consolidation of `RUN` commands."}]
