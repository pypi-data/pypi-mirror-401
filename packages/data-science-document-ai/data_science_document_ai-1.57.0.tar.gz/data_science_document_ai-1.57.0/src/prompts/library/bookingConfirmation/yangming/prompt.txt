Table Structure to extract TransporLegs:
- transportlegs table has following colum names: From, To, By, ETD, ETA
- If the first leg does not have a ETD and ETA, Also By column includes following info: ["Truck", "Combined Waterway"]; skip the row, start from one row below.

Further explanation for the transportLegs part as follows:
- you must differentiate the Voyage from DP Voyage. Never used the value with the key 'DP Voyage'.
- Vessel name is in 'By' column and under the key Vessel
- 'eta' must be equal or later than 'etd'!
- portOfLoading and portOfDischarge are name of the Ports. You can rely on the port names from all over the world.
- portOfLoading and portOfDischarge distinctly denotes the name of the ports. If you find abbreviation of the port use it, if not you can use the full name of the port
- Abbrevations most likely to be in the paranthesis like follows (DEHAM).

Further explanation for datapoints except transportLegs part as follows:
- If gateInReference is null, assign it the same value as bookingNumber.
- If pickUpReference is null, assign it the same value as bookingNumber.
- If mblNumber is null, assign it the same value as bookingNumber.

You must apply the following rules:
- The JSON schema must be followed during the extraction.
- The values must only include text found in the document
- Do not normalize any entity value.
- Validate the JSON make sure its a valid JSON ! No extra text, no missing comma!
