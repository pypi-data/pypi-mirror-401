Table Structure to extract TransportLegs:
- transportlegs table has following colum names: From, To, Mode, Vessel, Voy No., ETD, ETA
- The tables can be found under the title of Intended Transport Plan
- use Vessel column for vesselName. Do not mix 'Vessel' column with 'Mode' column. Vessel cannot be 'TRK' or 'RCO'!
- use 'Voy No.' column for voyage. Do not mix 'Voy No.' column with 'Mode' column. voyage cannot be 'TRK' or 'RCO'!
- If vesselName value is ROC, TRK or MVS, RCO it is a Mode not a vesselName.
- Don't use the same vesselName for multiple transport legs!
- The table rows are not uniform, the words can be wrapped.
- To be able to determine the number of row; you can reference the number of ETA and ETD.

Further explanation for datapoints except transportLegs part as follows:
- If gateInReference is null, assign it the same value as bookingNumber.
- If pickUpReference is null, assign it the same value as bookingNumber.
- If mblNumber is null, assign 'MAEU' + bookingNumber. E.g. if booking number is '244211559', assign 'MAEU244211559'.
