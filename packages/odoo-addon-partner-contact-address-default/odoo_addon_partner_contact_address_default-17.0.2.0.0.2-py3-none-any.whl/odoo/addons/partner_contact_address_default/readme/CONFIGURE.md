1. Go to **Settings**.
2. Under **Contact Category**, configure the following options:

    * **Contact Address Default Allow All Partners**  
      Enable this option to allow selecting any partner, instead of being limited  
      to child contacts of the commercial partner.

    * **Contact Shipping Address Delivery & Partner Only**  
      Enable this option to restrict the **Shipping address** field to  
      delivery-type contacts of the commercial partner and the partner itself.  
      This setting takes precedence over **Contact Address Default Allow All  
      Partners** for shipping addresses.
