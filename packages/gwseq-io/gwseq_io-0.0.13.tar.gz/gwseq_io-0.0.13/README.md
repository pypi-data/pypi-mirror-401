### Read bigWig and bigBed signal

```python

values = reader.read_signal(chr_ids, centers=centers, span=span)
```

Parameters:
- `chr_ids` `starts` `ends` `centers` Chromosomes ids, starts, ends and centers of locations. Both `starts` `ends` or one of `starts` `ends` `centers` (with `span`) may be specified.
- `span` Reading window in bp relative to locations `starts` `ends` `centers`. Only one reference may be specified if specified. Not by default.
