# URaster: Structured Raster to Unstructured Mesh

## Overview

**URaster** is a Python package to convert structured raster datasets into unstructured mesh structure, designed to bridge the gap between structured raster datasets and unstructured mesh-based hydrologic and land surface models. It leverages GDAL/OGR for robust data handling.

## ✨ Core Features

- **GDAL-Native Vector Handling**: Uses the standard GDAL/OGR engine for defining unstructured mesh cells, and performing projection-aware geospatial operations. It also support mesh cells that cross the International Date Line (IDL).

- **Standard Vector I/O**: Instead of directly operating on various mesh standards, it utilizes standard geographic information system vector formats (e.g., GeoJSON) for mesh operations, ensuring broad compatibility. It supports transformation APIs between existing meshes and standard vector formats.

- **Projection-Aware Operations**: Handles (raster dateaset) map projection differences to ensure accurate aggregation of raster values within each polygon.

- **Interactive GeoVista API**: Offers simple functions to visualize the input and the output vector layers on a 3D sphere.

## 💻 Installation

URaster requires GDAL for vector handling and GeoVista (which relies on PyVista/VTK) for 3D visualization.

> ⚠️ **GDAL Note**: Installing GDAL's Python bindings can be complex via pip due to platform dependencies. We strongly recommend using Conda for a stable installation of GDAL and all dependencies.

### Install via Conda (Recommended)
```bash
# Create a new conda environment (recommended)
conda create -n uraster-env python=3.9
conda activate uraster-env

# Install uraster and all dependencies via conda
conda install -c conda-forge uraster
```
