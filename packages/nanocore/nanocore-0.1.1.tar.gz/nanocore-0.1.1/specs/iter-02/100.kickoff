## Goal

In this iteration, we will focus on implementing real use cases using nanocore.

- [ ] Enhance the system by implementing messaging capabilities.
- [ ] Messages are serialized using JSON format.
- [ ] use the same headers as HTTP RFC, and From and To headers mimic the email RFC.
- [ ] the body is just another JSON object. Don't use \n\n and body, neither content-length.
