Temporal Query Module

This module provides comprehensive time-aware querying capabilities for the
Semantica framework, enabling temporal queries and analysis on knowledge
graphs with temporal information.

Key Features:
    - Time-point queries (query graph at specific time)
    - Time-range queries (query within time intervals)
    - Temporal pattern detection (sequences, cycles, trends)
    - Graph evolution analysis
    - Temporal path finding
    - Temporal version management

Main Classes:
    - TemporalGraphQuery: Main temporal query engine
    - TemporalPatternDetector: Temporal pattern detection engine
    - TemporalVersionManager: Temporal version/snapshot management

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.kg import TemporalGraphQuery
    >>> query_engine = TemporalGraphQuery()
    >>> result = query_engine.query_at_time(graph, query, at_time="2024-01-01")
    >>> evolution = query_engine.analyze_evolution(graph, start_time="2024-01-01")

    Temporal knowledge graph query engine.

    This class provides time-aware querying capabilities for knowledge graphs

    time ranges, and temporal pattern detection.

    Features:
        - Time-point queries (filter relationships valid at specific time)
        - Time-range queries (filter relationships valid within range)
        - Temporal pattern detection (sequences, cycles, trends)
        - Graph evolution analysis
        - Temporal path finding (paths considering temporal validity)

    Example Usage:
