Connectivity Analyzer Module

This module provides comprehensive connectivity analysis capabilities for the
Semantica framework, enabling analysis of graph connectivity, path finding,
and structural properties.

Key Features:
    - Graph connectivity analysis (connected/disconnected)
    - Connected components detection (DFS-based)
    - Shortest path calculation (BFS-based)
    - Bridge edge identification (edges whose removal disconnects graph)
    - Connectivity metrics (density, degree statistics)
    - Graph structure classification
    - NetworkX integration with fallback implementations

Main Classes:
    - ConnectivityAnalyzer: Main connectivity analysis engine

Example Usage:
    >>> from semantica.kg import ConnectivityAnalyzer
    >>> analyzer = ConnectivityAnalyzer()
    >>> connectivity = analyzer.analyze_connectivity(graph)
    >>> paths = analyzer.calculate_shortest_paths(graph, source="A", target="B")
    >>> bridges = analyzer.identify_bridges(graph)
