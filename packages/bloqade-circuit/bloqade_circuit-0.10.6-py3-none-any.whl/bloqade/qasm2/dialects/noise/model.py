    """Abstract base class for noise based on atom movement.

    This class defines the interface for a noise model. The gate noise is calculated from the parameters
    provided in this dataclass which can be updated when inheriting from this class. The move error is
    calculated by implementing the parallel_cz_errors method which takes a set of ctrl and qarg qubits
    and returns a noise model for all the qubits. The noise model is a dictionary with the keys being the
    error rates for the qubits and the values being the list of qubits that the error rate applies to.

    Once implemented the class can be used with the NoisePass to analyze a circuit and apply the noise
    model to the circuit.

    NOTE: This model is not guaranteed to be supported long-term in bloqade. We will be
    moving towards a more general approach to noise modeling in the future.

    The CZ gate noise is calculated using the following heuristic: The idle error is calculated by the total duration required
    to do the move and entangle the qubits. Not every pair can be entangled at the same time, so we first deconflict the qargs
    by finding subsets in which both the ctrl and the qarg qubits are in ascending order. This breaks the pairs into
    groups that can be moved and entangled separately. We then take each group and assign each pair to a gate zone slot. The
    slots are allocated by starting from the middle of the atoms and moving outwards making sure to keep the ctrl qubits in
    ascending order. The time to move a group is calculated by finding the maximum travel distance of the qarg and ctrl qubits
    and dviding by the move speed. The total move time is the sum of all the group move times. The error rate for all the qubits
    is then calculated by using the poisson_pauli_prob function. An additional error for the pick operation is calculated by
    joining the binary probabilities of the pick operation and the move operation.
