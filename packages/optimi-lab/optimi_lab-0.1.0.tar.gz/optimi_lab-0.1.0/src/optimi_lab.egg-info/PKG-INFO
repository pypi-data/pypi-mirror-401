# OPT-LAB

An extensible optimization toolbox for prototyping evolutionary and surrogate-based
optimization workflows.

## Overview

OPT-LAB provides implementations and utilities for evolutionary algorithms, surrogate models,
and sensitivity analysis. It is intended for researchers and practitioners who need a
lightweight framework for experiments and benchmarking.

## Key Features

- Multi-objective and single-objective optimization algorithms
- Surrogate modeling utilities and model selection helpers
- Built-in logging and experiment output management
- Examples and tests for reproducibility

## Installation

Recommended: install from source (development mode).

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DawnEver/opt-lab.git
cd opt-lab
```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment, uv is recommanded:
```bash
uv venv
# or use venv
pip -m venv .venv
```

3. Install the package
```bash
uv pip install -e . # for normal user
uv pip install -e ".[dev]" # for developer
```
## Usage

Typical steps:

1. Define an objective function.
2. Configure an optimizer (algorithm, population size, termination criteria).
3. Run the optimizer and inspect outputs in the `output/` directory.

See `examples/` for concrete usage examples.
