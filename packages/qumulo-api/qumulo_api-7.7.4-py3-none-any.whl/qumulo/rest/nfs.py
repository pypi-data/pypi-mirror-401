    Add an NFS export which exports a given filesystem path (fs_path), allowing
    clients to mount that path using the given export_path.

    @param export_path: The path clients will use to specify this export as the
        one to mount. Essentially, the public name of the export.
    @param fs_path: The true path in the Qumulo file system which will then be
        mounted. Clients will not normally be aware of this path when mounting;
        and through the export will not be able to see files/directories outside
        of this path.
    @param description: A description of the export, for administrative
        reference.
    @param restrictions: a list of NFSExportRestriction objects representing
        restrictions on the ways the export can be used (See
        NFSExportRestriction for details).

        The restriction that applies to a given client connection is the first
        one in the list whose "host_restrictions" field includes the client's
        IP address.
    @param allow_fs_path_create: When true, the server will create the fs_path
        directories if they don't exist already.
    @param tenant_id: The tenant that this export will be accessible to.
    @param fields_to_present_as_32_bit a list of field types that should be
        forced to fit in 32bit integers for mounts of this export.  This is
        useful for supporting legacy clients / applictations.  The following
        fields are supported:
        "FILE_IDS" - Hash large file IDs (inode numbers) to fit in 32bits.
            This is known to be necessary for certain deprecated linux system
            calls (e.g. to list a directory) to work. This might break
            applications that try to use inode number to uniquely identify
            files, e.g. rsync hardlink detection.
        "FS_SIZE" - Saturate reported total, used, and free space to 4GiB.
            This is the information that feeds tools like "df".  Note
            that this does not (directly) limit space that is actually available
            to the application.
        "FILE_SIZES" - Saturate size reported for large files to 4GiB.
            This should be used with caution, as it could result in serious
            misbehavior by 64bit applications accessing larger files via this
            export.
