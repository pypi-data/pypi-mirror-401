SAGE Agentic Workflow Framework

Layer: L3 (Core - Research & Algorithm Library)

This module provides a comprehensive framework for researching and developing
both workflow GENERATION and OPTIMIZATION strategies. It enables students and
researchers to experiment with different approaches in a consistent environment.

Architecture:
    - Base abstractions for workflow representation
    - Workflow GENERATORS: Create workflows from user requirements
      * Rule-based generation (keyword matching)
      * LLM-driven generation (intelligent understanding)
      * Template-based generation
      * Hybrid approaches
    - Workflow OPTIMIZERS: Optimize existing workflows
      * Cost optimization
      * Latency optimization
      * Quality optimization
    - Evaluation metrics and benchmarking tools

Two-Phase Workflow:
    User Input → [GENERATION] → Initial Workflow → [OPTIMIZATION] → Final Workflow

Generation Example:
    >>> from sage_libs.sage_agentic.workflow import GenerationContext
    >>> from sage_libs.sage_agentic.workflow.generators import LLMWorkflowGenerator
    >>>
    >>> # Generate workflow from natural language
    >>> generator = LLMWorkflowGenerator(model="gpt-4")
    >>> context = GenerationContext(
    ...     user_input="Create a RAG pipeline for document Q&A",
    ...     constraints={"max_cost": 100, "max_latency": 5.0}
    ... )
    >>> result = generator.generate(context)
    >>> workflow = result.visual_pipeline

Optimization Example:
    >>> from sage_libs.sage_agentic.workflow import WorkflowGraph
    >>> from sage_libs.sage_agentic.workflow.optimizers import GreedyOptimizer
    >>>
    >>> # Optimize an existing workflow
    >>> workflow = WorkflowGraph()
    >>> workflow.add_node("analyzer", cost=10, quality=0.8)
    >>> workflow.add_node("generator", cost=20, quality=0.9)
    >>> workflow.add_edge("analyzer", "generator")
    >>>
    >>> optimizer = GreedyOptimizer()
    >>> optimized = optimizer.optimize(workflow, constraints={"max_cost": 25})
    >>> print(f"Cost saved: ${workflow.total_cost() - optimized.total_cost()}")
