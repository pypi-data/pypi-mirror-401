## 🐍 **pyaging**: a Python-based compendium of GPU-optimized aging clocks

`pyaging` is a cutting-edge Python package designed for the longevity research community, offering a comprehensive suite of GPU-optimized biological aging clocks.

[Installation](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html) - [Clock gallery](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/clock_glossary.html) - [Search, cite, get metadata and clock parameters](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_utils.html) - [Illumina Human Methylation Arrays](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_dnam_illumina_human_array.html) - [Illumina Mammalian Methylation Arrays](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_dnam_illumina_mammalian_array.html) - [RRBS DNA methylation](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_dnam_rrbs.html) - [Bulk histone mark ChIP-Seq](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_histonemarkchipseq.html) - [Bulk ATAC-Seq](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_atacseq.html) - [Bulk RNA-Seq](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_rnaseq.html) - [Blood chemistry](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_bloodchemistry.html) - [CpGPTGrimAge3](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorials/tutorial_cpgptgrimage3.html) - [API Reference](https://pyaging.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pyaging.html)

With a growing number of aging clocks and biomarkers of aging, comparing and analyzing them can be challenging. `pyaging` simplifies this process, allowing researchers to input various molecular layers (DNA methylation, histone ChIP-Seq, ATAC-seq, transcriptomics, etc.) and quickly analyze them using multiple aging clocks, thanks to its GPU-backed infrastructure. This makes it an ideal tool for large datasets and multi-layered analysis.

## ❓ Can't find an aging clock?

If you have recently developed an aging clock and would like it to be integrated into `pyaging`, please [email me](lucas_camillo@alumni.brown.edu). I aim to incorporate it within one to two weeks! I'm also happy to adapt to any licensing terms for commercial entities.
