"""
PDF link remapping utilities.

This module defines the :class:`LinkRemapper` class, which manages the process of
rewriting link actions when combining or transforming PDF documents.

When pages are copied, rotated, scaled, or merged between PDFs, any internal
link destinations (e.g., GoTo actions or named destinations) must be updated so
they continue to point to the correct targets in the output document. This module
encapsulates that logic and provides safe mechanisms to:

  • Copy or rebind action dictionaries into a new PDF context.
  • Resolve named and explicit link destinations.
  • Apply coordinate transformations for rotated or scaled pages.
  • Preserve or rewrite named destinations with unique identifiers.

It depends on :mod:`pikepdf` for PDF object manipulation and expects precomputed
maps describing the relationship between source and target pages.
