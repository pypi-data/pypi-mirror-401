_ROTATE_LONG_DESC = """

Rotates pages by 90, 180, or 270 degrees. Each '<spec>' consists of a
page range followed by a rotation direction. A rotation direction is
either a cardinal direction or a relative direction.

The cardinal directions `north`, `east`, `south`, `west` are absolute
rotations, relative to the page's "natural" orientation which is
`north`. (You get to find out what this natural orientation is by
setting this to `north` and inspecting the file. Often it is `north`
already but not always.)

The relative directions `left`, `right`, `down` are relative to the
page's current rotation, viewed from the topside of the page. For
example, `down` will turn pages upside-down. And `right` rotates 90
degrees clockwise.

For example, '1-endeast' orients all pages 90 degrees clockwise
compared to their natural rotation.

And '2-3left 4south' rotates pages 2-3 leftwards and makes page 4
Australian.
