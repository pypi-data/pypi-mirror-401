"""Chop pages of a PDF into smaller pieces either
horizontally (into rows) or vertically (into columns).

The chop operation allows you to split pages of a PDF into
smaller parts. The resulting pages can be manipulated
individually, depending on the specified chopping rules. The
operation supports multiple specification formats, including
page ranges, piece sizes, and more.

For further details on the syntax, see the 'Specification
syntax' section below.

_CHOP_LONG_DESC = """

Chops specified pages into multiple smaller pieces by splitting them
either horizontally or vertically. The output PDF contains the
resulting chopped pieces in order. Pages from the input file that are
not matched by any spec are copied to the output unmodified.  The size
of each piece may be specified using `<spec>...`; see examples.
Depending on your shell, you may need to quote a `<spec>` which uses
parentheses.

The chop operation is controlled by one or more specification strings.
A specification can apply to all pages, or be targeted to specific
pages using pageranges or even/odd keywords.

Specification syntax:

    `[<page_spec>][cols|rows][<sizes_or_pieces>]`

Examples:

   `1-10cols2`

     Apply a vertical 2-piece chop to pages 1 through 10.

   `evencols(1:2)`

     Apply a vertical 1-to-2 ratio chop to all even pages.

   `odd 4-endcols3`

     Apply a vertical 3-piece chop to odd pages from 4 to the end.

   `rows`

     Chop horizontally (creating rows).

### Specification details


`<page_spec>` is a page specification, consisting of an
optional page range (like `1-4`) followed immediately by an
optional `even` or `odd`.  If no page range is given, all
pages are assumed. See also the help topic [[`page_spec`]].


`<sizes_or_pieces>` defines the dimensions of the chopped
pieces.  This can be specified in several ways.

    If omitted, the default is 2 equal pieces.

    `<integer>`
      Chop into N equal-sized pieces.

      Example: `cols3` (Chop into 3 equal vertical columns).

    `<list>`
      comma-separated list of custom sizes. Parentheses are optional.

      Example: `rows(100, fill, 100)` or `rows100,fill,100`

   `<ratios>`
      A colon-separated list of ratios.

      Example: `cols(1:2)` (A vertical chop with the second column being
      twice as wide as the first).

Size Units (for use in `<list>` format):

    `pt` (default)

      Size in points. 1 inch = 72 points. `100` is the same as `100pt`.

    `%`

      Percentage of the total page width (for `cols`) or height (for `rows`).

    `fill`

      A keyword that expands to fill the remaining space. If used
      multiple times, the remaining space is split evenly between each
      fill .

    `d`

      Appending `d` to any size in a custom list will cause that piece
      to be discarded from the output. This is useful for trimming
      margins.
