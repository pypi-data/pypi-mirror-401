# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.31.0] - 2026-01-09
### Changed
- Add more type hints across tokenizer and tree builder internals (thanks @collinanderson).

## [0.30.0] - 2026-01-03
### Changed
- BREAKING: Rename URL sanitization API (see [URL Cleaning](docs/url-cleaning.md)):
  - `UrlPolicy.rules` -> `UrlPolicy.allow_rules`
  - `UrlPolicy.url_handling` -> `UrlPolicy.default_handling`
  - `UrlPolicy.allow_relative` -> `UrlPolicy.default_allow_relative`
  - `UrlRule.url_handling` -> `UrlRule.handling`
- BREAKING: URL allow rules now behave like an allowlist: if an attribute matches `UrlPolicy.allow_rules` and the URL validates, it is kept by default. To strip or proxy a specific attribute, set `UrlRule.handling="strip"` / `"proxy"` (see [URL Cleaning](docs/url-cleaning.md)).
- BREAKING: Proxying is still supported, but is now configured per attribute rule (`UrlRule.handling="proxy"`) instead of via a policy-wide default. Proxy mode requires a proxy to be configured either globally (`UrlPolicy.proxy`) or per rule (`UrlRule.proxy`) (see [URL Cleaning](docs/url-cleaning.md)).
- BREAKING: `UrlPolicy.default_handling` now defaults to `"strip"` (see [URL Cleaning](docs/url-cleaning.md)).

## [0.29.0] - 2026-01-03
### Changed
- Default policy change: `DEFAULT_POLICY` now blocks remote image loads by default (`img[src]` only allows relative URLs). Use a custom policy to allow `http(s)` images if you want them (see [URL Cleaning](docs/url-cleaning.md)).

## [0.28.0] - 2026-01-03
### Changed
- BREAKING: URL sanitization is now explicitly controlled by `UrlPolicy`/`UrlRule`. URL-like attributes (for example `href`, `src`, `srcset`) are dropped by default unless you provide an explicit `(tag, attr)` rule in `UrlPolicy.rules` (see [URL Cleaning](docs/url-cleaning.md)).
- BREAKING: Replace legacy “remote URL handling” configuration with `UrlPolicy(url_handling="allow"|"strip"|"proxy", allow_relative=...)` (see [URL Cleaning](docs/url-cleaning.md)).

### Added
- Add `UrlProxy` and URL rewriting via `UrlPolicy(url_handling="proxy")`.
- Add `srcset` parsing + sanitization using the same URL policy rules.
- Split sanitization docs into an overview plus deeper guides for HTML cleaning, URL cleaning, and unsafe handling (see [Sanitization](docs/sanitization.md)).

## [0.27.0] - 2026-01-03
### Added
- Add `unsafe_handling` mode to `SanitizationPolicy`, including an option to raise on all security findings.

### Changed
- Enhance sanitization policy behavior and error collection to support reporting security findings.
- Improve ordering of collected security errors by input position.
- Improve Playground parse error UI, including sanitizer security findings.

### Security
- (Severity: Low) Set explicit GitHub Actions workflow token permissions (`contents: read`) to address a CodeQL code scanning alert.

## [0.26.0] - 2026-01-02
### Added
- Add security policy (`SECURITY.md`) and update documentation to reference it.
### Changed
- Optimize whitespace collapsing and enhance attribute unquoting logic in serialization.
- Enhance `clone_node` method to support attribute overriding in `SimpleDomNode`.
- Normalize `rel` tokens in `SanitizationPolicy` for performance improvement.

## [0.25.0] - 2026-01-02
### Added
- Improve serialization speed by 5%.
- Introduce `CSS_PRESET_TEXT` for conservative inline styling and enhance sanitization policy validation.
### Changed
- Add benchmark for `justhtml parse` and `serialize --to-html` flag.

## [0.24.0] - 2026-01-01
### Security
- (Severity: Low) Fix inline CSS sanitization bypass where comments (`/**/`) inside `url()` could evade blacklisting of constructs that made external network calls. No XSS was possible. This required `style` attributes and URL-accepting properties to be allowlisted. No known exploits in the wild.
