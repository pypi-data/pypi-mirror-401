Healthcare Disclaimer

In the United States, or any other jurisdictions where they may apply, the
following additional disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability are
hereby incorporated into the terms and conditions of MPL 2.0:

1.    No warranties of any kind whatsoever are made as to the results that
      You will obtain from relying upon the covered code (or any information
      or content obtained by way of the covered code), including but not
      limited to compliance with privacy laws or regulations or clinical
      care industry standards and protocols. Use of the covered code is not
      a substitute for a health care provider's standard practice or
      professional judgment. Any decision with regard to the appropriateness
      of treatment, or the validity or reliability of information or content
      made available by the covered code, is the sole responsibility of the
      health care provider. Consequently, it is incumbent upon each health
      care provider to verify all medical history and treatment plans with
      each patient.

2.    Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether tort
      (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall any Contributor,
      or anyone who distributes Covered Software as permitted by the
      license, be liable to You for any indirect, special, incidental,
      consequential damages of any character including, without limitation,
      damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or
      malfunction, or any and all other damages or losses, of any nature
      whatsoever (direct or otherwise) on account of or associated with the
      use or inability to use the covered content (including, without
      limitation, the use of information or content made available by the
      covered code, all documentation associated therewith, and the failure
      of the covered code to comply with privacy laws and regulations or
      clinical care industry standards and protocols), even if such party
      shall have been informed of the possibility of such damages.
