# DFM Configuration for Macroeconomic Datasets
# Based on Korean economic indicators (KO* series)
# Data: 101 series, mixed weekly/monthly frequency (1985-04-05 to 2025-11-21)
# Clock: Weekly (w) - base frequency for latent factors
# Target: KOEQUIPTE (Investment, Equipment, Estimation, SA)

# EM Algorithm Parameters
ar_lag: 1  # Global AR lag order (applies to all blocks)
threshold: 1.0e-05  # EM convergence threshold
max_iter: 5000  # Maximum EM iterations

# Numerical Stability Parameters
clip_ar_coefficients: true
ar_clip_min: -0.99
ar_clip_max: 0.99
use_regularization: true
regularization_scale: 1.0e-05

# Idiosyncratic Component Parameters
augment_idio: true
augment_idio_slow: true  # Important for mixed-frequency macro data (weekly clock, monthly indicators)
idio_rho0: 0.1
idio_min_var: 1.0e-08

# Data Handling
clock: w  # Weekly clock frequency (base frequency for latent factors)
# target_scaler: Pass sklearn scaler object directly (e.g., StandardScaler(), RobustScaler())
# Example in Python:
#   from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
#   config.target_scaler = StandardScaler()
# Note: nan_method and nan_k are internal constants (not user-configurable)

# Block Structure for Macroeconomic Data
# Simplified for faster testing - reduced to 2 blocks with essential series
# Series can appear in multiple blocks to capture different factor structures
blocks:
  Block_Real:
    num_factors: 2  # Real economy factors (production, employment, consumption, investment)
    series:
      - KOCONPRCF  # Production
      - KOEMPTOTO  # Total employment
      - KOHWRWEMP  # Hours worked
      - KOWRCCNSE  # Consumption
      - KOIMPCONA  # Investment
  Block_Prices_Financial:
    num_factors: 2  # Price, financial, and survey factors (combined for testing)
    series:
      - KOCPCOREF  # Consumer prices
      - KOCPEXFEF  # Export prices
      - KOWRCCNSE  # Consumption (overlap with Block_Real)
      - KOCREU..A  # Credit
      - KOLRLTHH  # Interest rates
      - KOBSIHAPR  # Business survey
      - KOCNFCONR  # Confidence

# Frequency mapping for mixed-frequency macro data
# Clock is weekly (w), so monthly series are slower frequency
# Grouped format: frequencies are specified as lists grouped by frequency code
# Reduced set for faster testing (~50% reduction: 18 monthly series kept from original ~36)
frequency:
  # Monthly series (slower than weekly clock) - typically end-of-month observations
  # Block_Real series
  m:
    - KOEMPTOTO  # Total employment (monthly)
    - KOHWRWEMP  # Hours worked (monthly)
    - KOIMPCONA  # Investment, Construction (monthly)
    - KOWRCCNSE  # Consumption (monthly)
    - KOCONPRCF  # Production (monthly)
    # Block_Prices_Financial series
    - KOCPCOREF  # Consumer prices (monthly)
    - KOCPEXFEF  # Export prices (monthly)
    - KOCREU..A  # Credit (monthly)
    - KOLRLTHH  # Interest rates (monthly)
    - KOBSIHAPR  # Business survey (monthly)
    - KOCNFCONR  # Confidence (monthly)
    # Target series
    - KOEQUIPTE  # Investment, Equipment (monthly, target series)
  # Weekly series (same as clock frequency)
  w:
    - KORFBEV  # Retail, Food & Beverages (weekly)
    - KORWHLS  # Retail, Wholesale (weekly)
    - KORMCMP  # Retail, Miscellaneous & Comparison (weekly)
    - KORELEC  # Retail, Electronics (weekly)
    - KORCNST  # Retail, Construction (weekly)
    - KORMACH  # Retail, Machinery (weekly)
    - KOROCOINF  # Retail, Other Consumer & Information (weekly)
