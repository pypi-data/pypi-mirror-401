"""
Submodule for generating SysML visualizations.

Note that this any features in this module are still in very
early stages and subject to change. Features will be extended
and more implemented in future versions.

Currently implemented:

- hierarchical nodes and edges
- binary edges
- n-ary edges
- metadata prefixes
- annotating elements
- DOT nested and interconnection diagrams
- edges from ``Types``, e.g. ``Connections``, ``Flows``
- rendering common ``Type`` declarations, including heritage, and feature values

To be implemented:

- rendering type-specific declarations, e.g. connectors
- inserting cross-referenced elements
- inserting and modifying nodes and edges manually
- more rendered graph types
- more render targets
- embedded hyperlinks
- semantically highlighted SysML text
- styling
- layouting
