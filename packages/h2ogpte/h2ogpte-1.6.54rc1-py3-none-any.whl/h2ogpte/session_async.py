                rag_max_chunks:
                    Maximum number of document chunks to retrieve for RAG.
                    If not specified (default: -1), actual number depends on rag_type and admin configuration.
                    Set to >0 values to enable.
                    Can be combined with rag_min_chunk_score.
                rag_min_chunk_score:
                    Minimum score of document chunks to retrieve for RAG.
                    If not specified (default: 0.0), will not filter chunks by score.
                    Set to >0 values to enable.
                    Can be combined with rag_max_chunks.
            include_chat_history:
                Whether to include chat history. Includes previous questions and answers for
                the current chat session for each new chat request. Disable if require deterministic
                answers for a given question.
                Choices are: ["on","off","auto",True,False]
            tags:
                A list of tags from which to pull the context for RAG.
            metadata_filter:
                A dictionary to filter documents by metadata, from which to pull the context for RAG.
            timeout:
                Amount of time in seconds to allow the request to run. The default is
                1000 seconds.
            retries:
                Amount of retries to allow the request to run when hits a network issue. The default is 3.
            callback:
                Function for processing partial messages, used for streaming responses
                to an end user.
        Returns:
            ChatMessage: The response text and details about the response from the LLM.
            For example::
                ChatMessage(
