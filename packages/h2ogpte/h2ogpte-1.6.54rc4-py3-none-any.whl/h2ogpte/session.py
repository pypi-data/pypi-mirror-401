                rag_type: str one of
                    :code:`"auto"` Automatically select the best rag_type.
                    :code:`"llm_only"` LLM Only - Answer the query without any supporting document contexts.
                        Requires 1 LLM or Agent call.
                    :code:`"agent_only"` Agent Only - Answer the query with only original files passed to agent.
                        Requires 1 Agent call.
                    :code:`"rag"` RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) - Use supporting document contexts
                        to answer the query. Requires 1 LLM or Agent call.
                    :code:`"hyde1"` LLM Only + RAG composite - HyDE RAG (Hypothetical Document Embedding).
                        Use 'LLM Only' response to find relevant contexts from a collection for generating
                        a response. Requires 2 LLM calls.
                    :code:`"hyde2"` HyDE + RAG composite - Use the 'HyDE RAG' response to find relevant
                        contexts from a collection for generating a response. Requires 3 LLM calls.
                    :code:`"rag+"` Summary RAG - Like RAG, but uses more context and recursive
                        summarization to overcome LLM context limits. Keeps all retrieved chunks, puts
                        them in order, adds neighboring chunks, then uses the summary API to get the
                        answer. Can require several LLM calls.

                        chunks. Uses recursive summarization to overcome LLM context limits.
                        Can require several LLM calls.

                    Add this prompt to every user's prompt, when generating answers to be used
                    for subsequent retrieval during HyDE. Only used when rag_type is "hyde1" or "hyde2".
                    example: :code:`'\\\\nKeep the answer brief, and list the 5 most
                    relevant key words at the end.'`
                num_neighbor_chunks_to_include: int
                    Number of neighboring chunks to include for every retrieved relevant chunk. Helps
                    to keep surrounding context together. Only enabled for rag_type "rag+". Defaults to 1.
                meta_data_to_include:
                    A dictionary containing flags that indicate whether each piece of document metadata is to be included as part of the context for a chat with a collection.
                    Default is {

                rag_max_chunks:
                    Maximum number of document chunks to retrieve for RAG.
                    If not specified (default: -1), actual number depends on rag_type and admin configuration.
                    Set to >0 values to enable.
                    Can be combined with rag_min_chunk_score.
                rag_min_chunk_score:
                    Minimum score of document chunks to retrieve for RAG.
                    If not specified (default: 0.0), will not filter chunks by score.
                    Set to >0 values to enable.
                    Can be combined with rag_max_chunks.
            include_chat_history:
                Whether to include chat history. Includes previous questions and answers for
                the current chat session for each new chat request. Disable if require deterministic
                answers for a given question.
                Choices are: ["on","off","auto",True,False]
            tags:
                A list of tags from which to pull the context for RAG.
            metadata_filter:
                A dictionary to filter documents by metadata, from which to pull the context for RAG.
            timeout:
                Amount of time in seconds to allow the request to run. The default is 1000 seconds.
            retries:
                Amount of retries to allow the request to run when hits a network issue. The default is 3.
            callback:
                Function for processing partial messages, used for streaming responses
                to an end user.

        Returns:
            ChatMessage: The response text and details about the response from the LLM.
