# exceptions.SDAResponseError { #soildb.exceptions.SDAResponseError }

```python
exceptions.SDAResponseError(message, query=None, details=None)
```

Raised when SDA returns an invalid or unexpected response format.

This occurs when the SDA service returns a response that cannot be parsed
or validated. Unlike SDAQueryError, this indicates the query was accepted
but the response was malformed.
