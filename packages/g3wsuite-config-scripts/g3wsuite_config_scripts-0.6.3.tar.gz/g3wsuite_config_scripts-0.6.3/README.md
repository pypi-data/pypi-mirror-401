Don't have a config.properties file? No problem, you can generate one with the following command:

```bash
g3w_config_gen
```

This will generate a config.properties file in the current directory based on the answers given by the user.

#### Branding

Place yourself in the same folder in which you ran the setup scripts and just run the 
branding module:

```bash
g3w_branding
```

You will be asked for all the possible branding parameters.
