"""
Centralized window positioning and sizing utilities for PIV processing.

This module provides unified functions for computing interrogation window centers,
padding, and grid positioning across all PIV modes (instantaneous, ensemble standard,
and ensemble single mode).

Coordinate System Convention:
    - 0-based indexing throughout
    - Cartesian convention: (0, 0) represents bottom-left conceptually
    - Arrays stored row-major: array[y, x] where y=vertical, x=horizontal
    - Window centers use floating-point positions (e.g., 63.5 for center of 128-pixel window)

Mathematical Formulas:
    Standard Mode:
        first_ctr = (win_size - 1) / 2.0
        last_ctr = image_size - (win_size + 1) / 2.0
        n_windows = floor((last_ctr - first_ctr) / spacing) + 1

    Single Mode (Ensemble):
        Small window positioned on grid (e.g., 4x4)
        Large SumWindow used for correlation (e.g., 16x16)
        Padding applied to accommodate SumWindow around small window positions

    """
    Compute padding required for ensemble single mode.

    In single mode, Frame A uses a small window (e.g., 4x4) but Frame B uses
    a larger SumWindow (e.g., 16x16) for correlation. The image must be padded
    to accommodate the larger window around the small window positions.

    Padding is distributed asymmetrically using ceil/floor to handle odd differences.
    This matches the MATLAB implementation in PIV_2D_wdef_ensemble.m lines 161-164.

    """
    Compute window center positions for standard PIV processing.

    This is the unified formula used across instantaneous PIV, ensemble standard mode,
    and mask computation. It ensures only full windows fit within the image boundaries.

    The formula guarantees:
    - First window is fully within image (center at (win_size-1)/2)
    - Last window is fully within image (center at image_size - (win_size+1)/2)
    - All intermediate windows are evenly spaced

    ----------
    image_shape : Tuple[int, int]
        (H, W) - height and width of image in pixels
    window_size : Tuple[int, int]
        (win_height, win_width) - interrogation window size in pixels
    overlap : float
        Overlap percentage (0-100). E.g., 50 means 50% overlap between adjacent windows

    Mathematical Derivation:
        Window half-width: hw = win_width / 2

    """
    Compute window center positions for ensemble single mode.

    Single mode is a specialized ensemble PIV technique where:
    - Frame A uses a small window (e.g., 4x4) with center=1, rest=0 weighting
    - Frame B uses a large SumWindow (e.g., 16x16) with all=1 weighting
    - This reduces particle dropout bias in ensemble averaging

    The computation:
    1. Applies padding to image to accommodate SumWindow around small window positions
    2. Grid spacing is based on SMALL window size (determines resolution)
    3. Window centers are positioned relative to LARGE SumWindow (determines correlation size)
