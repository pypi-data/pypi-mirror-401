"""Energy reporting metrics for production, consumption, and storage analysis.

This module provides helper functions for calculating and analyzing energy
flows within a hybrid power system — including production, consumption,
battery charging, grid feed-in, and self-consumption metrics.

Key features:
It standardizes sign conventions (via `production_is_positive`) and ensures
consistency in derived quantities such as:
  - Production surplus (excess generation)
  - Energy stored in a battery
  - Grid feed-in power
  - Self-consumption and self-consumption share
  - Inferred consumption when not explicitly provided

Usage:
    These functions serve as building blocks for energy reporting and
    dashboards that report on the performance of energy assets.
